<stru>Armadale



by Wilkie Collins</stru>









<stru>TO



JOHN FORSTER.



In acknowledgment of the services which he has rendered to

the cause of literature by his "Life of Goldsmith;" and in

affectionate remembrance of a friendship which is associated

with some of the happiest years of my life.







Readers in general--on whose friendly reception experience has

given me some reason to rely--will, I venture to hope, appreciate

whatever merit there may be in this story without any prefatory

pleading for it on my part. They will, I think, see that it has

not been hastily meditated or idly wrought out. They will judge

it accordingly, and I ask no more.



Readers in particular will, I have some reason to suppose, be

here and there disturbed, perhaps even offended, by finding that

"Armadale" oversteps, in more than one direction, the narrow

limits within which they are disposed to restrict the development

of modern fiction--if they can.



Nothing that I could say to these persons here would help me with

them as Time will help me if my work lasts. I am not afraid of my

design being permanently misunderstood, provided the execution

has done it any sort of justice. Estimated by the clap-trap

morality of the present day, this may be a very daring book.

Judged by the Christian morality which is of all time, it is only

a book that is daring enough to speak the truth.

<p pid="2" id="arma.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="arma.c1.s2">It was the opening of the season of eighteen hundred and thirty-two, at the Baths of Wildbad.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="arma.c1.p3"><s sid="3" id="arma.c1.s3">The evening shadows were beginning to gather over the quiet little German town, and the diligence was expected every minute.</s> <s sid="4" id="arma.c1.s4">Before the door of the principal inn, waiting the arrival of the first visitors of the year, were assembled the three notable personages of Wildbad, accompanied by their wives--the mayor, representing the inhabitants; the doctor, representing the waters; the landlord, representing his own establishment.</s> <s sid="5" id="arma.c1.s5">Beyond this select circle, grouped snugly about the trim little square in front of the inn, appeared the towns-people in general, mixed here and there with the country people, in their quaint German costume, placidly expectant of the diligence--the men in short black jackets, tight black breeches, and three-cornered beaver hats; the women with their long light hair hanging in one thickly plaited tail behind them, and the waists of their short woolen gowns inserted modestly in the region of their shoulder-blades.</s> <s sid="6" id="arma.c1.s6">Round the outer edge of the assemblage thus formed, flying detachments of plump white-headed children careered in perpetual motion; while, mysteriously apart from the rest of the inhabitants, the musicians of the Baths stood collected in one lost corner, waiting the appearance of the first visitors to play the first tune of the season in the form of a serenade.</s> <s sid="7" id="arma.c1.s7">The light of a May evening was still bright on the tops of the great wooded hills watching high over the town on the right hand and the left; and the cool breeze that comes before sunset came keenly fragrant here with the balsamic odor of the first of the Black Forest.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="arma.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="arma.c1.s8"><qs/>"Mr. Landlord,"<qe/><sls/> said the mayor's wife (giving the landlord his title), <sle/><qs/>"have you any foreign guests coming on this first day of the season?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="arma.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="arma.c1.s9"><qs/>"Madame Mayoress,"<qe/><sls/> replied the landlord (returning the compliment), <sle/><qs/>"I have two.</s> <s sid="10" id="arma.c1.s10">They have written--the one by the hand of his servant, the other by his own hand apparently--to order their rooms; and they are from England, both, as I think by their names.</s> <s sid="11" id="arma.c1.s11">If you ask me to pronounce those names, my tongue hesitates; if you ask me to spell them, here they are, letter by letter, first and second in their order as they come.</s> <s sid="12" id="arma.c1.s12">First, a high-born stranger (by title Mister) who introduces himself in eight letters, A, r, m, a, d, a, l, e--and comes ill in his own carriage.</s> <s sid="13" id="arma.c1.s13">Second, a high-born stranger (by title Mister also), who introduces himself in four letters--N, e, a, l--and comes ill in the diligence.</s> <s sid="14" id="arma.c1.s14">His excellency of the eight letters writes to me (by his servant) in French; his excellency of the four letters writes to me in German.</s> <s sid="15" id="arma.c1.s15">The rooms of both are ready.</s> <s sid="16" id="arma.c1.s16">I know no more."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="arma.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="arma.c1.s17"><qs/>"Perhaps,"<qe/><sss/> suggested the mayor's wife, <sse/><qs/>"Mr. Doctor has heard from one or both of these illustrious strangers?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="arma.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="arma.c1.s18"><qs/>"From one only, Madam Mayoress; but not, strictly speaking, from the person himself.</s> <s sid="19" id="arma.c1.s19">I have received a medical report of his excellency of the eight letters, and his case seems a bad one.</s> <s sid="20" id="arma.c1.s20">God help him!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="arma.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="arma.c1.s21"><qs/>"The diligence!"<qe/> cried a child from the outskirts of the crowd.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="arma.c1.p9"><s sid="22" id="arma.c1.s22">The musicians seized their instruments, and silence fell on the whole community.</s> <s sid="23" id="arma.c1.s23">From far away in the windings of the forest gorge, the ring of horses' bells came faintly clear through the evening stillness.</s> <s sid="24" id="arma.c1.s24">Which carriage was approaching--the private carriage with Mr. Armadale, or the public carriage with Mr. Neal?</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="arma.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="arma.c1.s25"><qs/>"Play, my friends!"<qe/> cried the mayor to the musicians.</s> <s sid="26" id="arma.c1.s26"><qs/>"Public or private, here are the first sick people of the season.</s> <s sid="27" id="arma.c1.s27">Let them find us cheerful."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="arma.c1.p11"><s sid="28" id="arma.c1.s28">The band played a lively dance tune, and the children in the square footed it merrily to the music.</s> <s sid="29" id="arma.c1.s29">At the same moment, their elders near the inn door drew aside, and disclosed the first shadow of gloom that fell over the gayety and beauty of the scene.</s> <s sid="30" id="arma.c1.s30">Through the opening made on either hand, a little procession of stout country girls advanced, each drawing after her an empty chair on wheels; each in waiting (and knitting while she waited) for the paralyzed wretches who came helpless by hundreds then--who come helpless by thousands now--to the waters of Wildbad for relief.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="arma.c1.p12"><s sid="31" id="arma.c1.s31">While the band played, while the children danced, while the buzz of many talkers deepened, while the strong young nurses of the coming cripples knitted impenetrably, a woman's insatiable curiosity about other women asserted itself in the mayor's wife.</s> <s sid="32" id="arma.c1.s32">She drew the landlady aside, and whispered a question to her on the spot.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="arma.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="arma.c1.s33"><qs/>"A word more, ma'am,"<qe/><sss/> said the mayor's wife, <sse/><qs/>"about the two strangers from England.</s> <s sid="34" id="arma.c1.s34">Are their letters explicit?</s> <s sid="35" id="arma.c1.s35">Have they got any ladies with them?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="arma.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="arma.c1.s36"><qs/>"The one by the diligence--no,"<qe/> replied the landlady.</s> <s sid="37" id="arma.c1.s37"><qs/>"But the one by the private carriage--yes.</s> <s sid="38" id="arma.c1.s38">He comes with a child; he comes with a nurse; and,"<qe/><sls/> concluded the landlady, skillfully keeping the main point of interest till the last, <sle/><qs/>"he comes with a Wife."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="arma.c1.p15"><s sid="39" id="arma.c1.s39">The mayoress brightened; the doctoress (assisting at the conference) brightened; the landlady nodded significantly.</s> <s sid="40" id="arma.c1.s40">In the minds of all three the same thought started into life at the same moment--"We shall see the Fashions!</s> <s sid="41" id="arma.c1.s41">"</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="arma.c1.p16"><s sid="42" id="arma.c1.s42">In a minute more, there was a sudden movement in the crowd; and a chorus of voices proclaimed that the travelers were at hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="arma.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="arma.c1.s43">By this time the coming vehicle was in sight, and all further doubt was at an end.</s> <s sid="44" id="arma.c1.s44">It was the diligence that now approached by the long street leading into the square--the diligence (in a dazzling new coat of yellow paint) that delivered the first visitors of the season at the inn door.</s> <s sid="45" id="arma.c1.s45">Of the ten travelers released from the middle compartment and the back compartment of the carriage--all from various parts of Germany--three were lifted out helpless, and were placed in the chairs on wheels to be drawn to their lodgings in the town.</s> <s sid="46" id="arma.c1.s46">The front compartment contained two passengers only--Mr. Neal and his traveling servant.</s> <s sid="47" id="arma.c1.s47">With an arm on either side to assist him, the stranger (whose malady appeared to be locally confined to a lameness in one of his feet) succeeded in descending the steps of the carriage easily enough.</s> <s sid="48" id="arma.c1.s48">While he steadied himself on the pavement by the help of his stick--looking not over-patiently toward the musicians who were serenading him with the waltz in <qs/>"Der Freischutz"<qe/>--his personal appearance rather damped the enthusiasm of the friendly little circle assembled to welcome him.</s> <s sid="49" id="arma.c1.s49">He was a lean, tall, serious, middle-aged man, with a cold gray eye and a long upper lip, with overhanging eyebrows and high cheek-bones; a man who looked what he was--every inch a Scotchman.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="arma.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="arma.c1.s50"><qs/>"Where is the proprietor of this hotel?"<qe/> he asked, speaking in the German language, with a fluent readiness of expression, and an icy coldness of manner.</s> <s sid="51" id="arma.c1.s51"><qs/>"Fetch the doctor,"<qe/><sls/> he continued, when the landlord had presented himself, <sle/><qs/>"I want to see him immediately."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="arma.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="arma.c1.s52"><qs/>"I am here already, sir,"<qe/><sls/> said the doctor, advancing from the circle of friends, <sle/><qs/>"and my services are entirely at your disposal."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="arma.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="arma.c1.s53"><qs/>"Thank you,"<qe/> said Mr. Neal, looking at the doctor, as the rest of us look at a dog when we have whistled and the dog has come.</s> <s sid="54" id="arma.c1.s54"><qs/>"I shall be glad to consult you to-morrow morning, at ten o'clock, about my own case.</s> <s sid="55" id="arma.c1.s55">I only want to trouble you now with a message which I have undertaken to deliver.</s> <s sid="56" id="arma.c1.s56">We overtook a traveling carriage on the road here with a gentleman in it--an Englishman, I believe--who appeared to be seriously ill. A lady who was with him begged me to see you immediately on my arrival, and to secure your professional assistance in removing the patient from the carriage.</s> <s sid="57" id="arma.c1.s57">Their courier has met with an accident, and has been left behind on the road, and they are obliged to travel very slowly.</s> <s sid="58" id="arma.c1.s58">If you are here in an hour, you will be here in time to receive them.</s> <s sid="59" id="arma.c1.s59">That is the message.</s> <s sid="60" id="arma.c1.s60">Who is this gentleman who appears to be anxious to speak to me?</s> <s sid="61" id="arma.c1.s61">The mayor?</s> <s sid="62" id="arma.c1.s62">If you wish to see my passport, sir, my servant will show it to you.</s> <s sid="63" id="arma.c1.s63">No?</s> <s sid="64" id="arma.c1.s64">You wish to welcome me to the place, and to offer your services?</s> <s sid="65" id="arma.c1.s65">I am infinitely flattered.</s> <s sid="66" id="arma.c1.s66">If you have any authority to shorten the performances of your town band, you would be doing me a kindness to exert it.</s> <s sid="67" id="arma.c1.s67">My nerves are irritable, and I dislike music.</s> <s sid="68" id="arma.c1.s68">Where is the landlord?</s> <s sid="69" id="arma.c1.s69">No; I want to see my rooms.</s> <s sid="70" id="arma.c1.s70">I don't want your arm; I can get upstairs with the help of my stick.</s> <s sid="71" id="arma.c1.s71">Mr. Mayor and Mr. Doctor, we need not detain one another any longer.</s> <s sid="72" id="arma.c1.s72">I wish you good-night."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="arma.c1.p21"><s sid="73" id="arma.c1.s73">Both mayor and doctor looked after the Scotchman as he limped upstairs, and shook their heads together in mute disapproval of him.</s> <s sid="74" id="arma.c1.s74">The ladies, as usual, went a step further, and expressed their opinions openly in the plainest words.</s> <s sid="75" id="arma.c1.s75">The case under consideration (so far as _they_ were concerned) was the scandalous case of a man who had passed them over entirely without notice.</s> <s sid="76" id="arma.c1.s76">Mrs. Mayor could only attribute such an outrage to the native ferocity of a savage.</s> <s sid="77" id="arma.c1.s77">Mrs. Doctor took a stronger view still, and considered it as proceeding from the inbred brutality of a hog.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="arma.c1.p22"><s sid="78" id="arma.c1.s78">The hour of waiting for the traveling-carriage wore on, and the creeping night stole up the hillsides softly.</s> <s sid="79" id="arma.c1.s79">One by one the stars appeared, and the first lights twinkled in the windows of the inn.</s> <s sid="80" id="arma.c1.s80">As the darkness came, the last idlers deserted the square; as the darkness came, the mighty silence of the forest above flowed in on the valley, and strangely and suddenly hushed the lonely little town.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="arma.c1.p23"><s sid="81" id="arma.c1.s81">The hour of waiting wore out, and the figure of the doctor, walking backward and forward anxiously, was still the only living figure left in the square.</s> <s sid="82" id="arma.c1.s82">Five minutes, ten minutes, twenty minutes, were counted out by the doctor's watch, before the first sound came through the night silence to warn him of the approaching carriage.</s> <s sid="83" id="arma.c1.s83">Slowly it emerged into the square, at the walking pace of the horses, and drew up, as a hearse might have drawn up, at the door of the inn.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="arma.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="arma.c1.s84"><qs/>"Is the doctor here?"<qe/> asked a woman's voice, speaking, out of the darkness of the carriage, in the French language.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="arma.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="arma.c1.s85"><qs/>"I am here, madam,"<qe/> replied the doctor, taking a light from the landlord's hand and opening the carriage door.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="arma.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="arma.c1.s86">The first face that the light fell on was the face of the lady who had just spoken--a young, darkly beautiful woman, with the tears standing thick and bright in her eager black eyes.</s> <s sid="87" id="arma.c1.s87">The second face revealed was the face of a shriveled old negress, sitting opposite the lady on the back seat.</s> <s sid="88" id="arma.c1.s88">The third was the face of a little sleeping child in the negress's lap.</s> <s sid="89" id="arma.c1.s89">With a quick gesture of impatience, the lady signed to the nurse to leave the carriage first with the child.</s> <s sid="90" id="arma.c1.s90"><qs/>"Pray take them out of the way,"<qe/><sls/> she said to the landlady; <sle/><qs/>"pray take them to their room."<qe/></s> <s sid="91" id="arma.c1.s91">She got out herself when her request had been complied with.</s> <s sid="92" id="arma.c1.s92">Then the light fell clear for the first time on the further side of the carriage, and the fourth traveler was disclosed to view.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="arma.c1.p27"><s sid="93" id="arma.c1.s93">He lay helpless on a mattress, supported by a stretcher; his hair, long and disordered, under a black skull-cap; his eyes wide open, rolling to and fro ceaselessly anxious; the rest of his face as void of all expression of the character within him, and the thought within him, as if he had been dead.</s> <s sid="94" id="arma.c1.s94">There was no looking at him now, and guessing what he might once have been.</s> <s sid="95" id="arma.c1.s95">The leaden blank of his face met every question as to his age, his rank, his temper, and his looks which that face might once have answered, in impenetrable silence.</s> <s sid="96" id="arma.c1.s96">Nothing spoke for him now but the shock that had struck him with the death-in-life of paralysis.</s> <s sid="97" id="arma.c1.s97">The doctor's eye questioned his lower limbs, and Death-in-Life answered, _I am here_.</s> <s sid="98" id="arma.c1.s98">The doctor's eye, rising attentively by way of his hands and arms, questioned upward and upward to the muscles round his mouth, and Death-in-Life answered, _I am coming_.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="arma.c1.p28"><s sid="99" id="arma.c1.s99">In the face of a calamity so unsparing and so dreadful, there was nothing to be said.</s> <s sid="100" id="arma.c1.s100">The silent sympathy of help was all that could be offered to the woman who stood weeping at the carriage door.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="arma.c1.p29"><s sid="101" id="arma.c1.s101">As they bore him on his bed across the hall of the hotel, his wandering eyes encountered the face of his wife.</s> <s sid="102" id="arma.c1.s102">They rested on her for a moment, and in that moment he spoke.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="arma.c1.p30" type="speech"><s sid="103" id="arma.c1.s103"><qs/>"The child?"<qe/> he said in English, with a slow, thick, laboring articulation.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="arma.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="arma.c1.s104"><qs/>"The child is safe upstairs,"<qe/> she answered, faintly.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="arma.c1.p32" type="speech"><s sid="105" id="arma.c1.s105"><qs/>"My desk?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="arma.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="arma.c1.s106"><qs/>"It is in my hands.</s> <s sid="107" id="arma.c1.s107">Look!</s> <s sid="108" id="arma.c1.s108">I won't trust it to anybody; I am taking care of it for you myself."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="arma.c1.p34" type="speech"><s sid="109" id="arma.c1.s109">He closed his eyes for the first time after that answer, and said no more.</s> <s sid="110" id="arma.c1.s110">Tenderly and skillfully he was carried up the stairs, with his wife on one side of him, and the doctor (ominously silent) on the other.</s> <s sid="111" id="arma.c1.s111">The landlord and the servants following saw the door of his room open and close on him; heard the lady burst out crying hysterically as soon as she was alone with the doctor and the sick man; saw the doctor come out, half an hour later, with his ruddy face a shade paler than usual; pressed him eagerly for information, and received but one answer to all their inquiries--<qs/>"Wait till I have seen him to-morrow.</s> <s sid="112" id="arma.c1.s112">Ask me nothing to-night."<qe/></s> <s sid="113" id="arma.c1.s113">They all knew the doctor's ways, and they augured ill when he left them hurriedly with that reply.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="arma.c1.p35"><s sid="114" id="arma.c1.s114">So the two first English visitors of the year came to the Baths of Wildbad in the season of eighteen hundred and thirty-two.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="1" id="arma.c4.p1"><s sid="1" id="arma.c4.s1">THE MYSTERY OF OZIAS MIDWINTER.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="arma.c4.p2"><s sid="2" id="arma.c4.s2">ON a warm May night, in the year eighteen hundred and fifty-one, the Reverend Decimus Brock--at that time a visitor to the Isle of Man--retired to his bedroom at Castletown, with a serious personal responsibility in close pursuit of him, and with no distinct idea of the means by which he might relieve himself from the pressure of his present circumstances.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="arma.c4.p3"><s sid="3" id="arma.c4.s3">The clergyman had reached that mature period of human life at which a sensible man learns to decline (as often as his temper will let him) all useless conflict with the tyranny of his own troubles.</s> <s sid="4" id="arma.c4.s4">Abandoning any further effort to reach a decision in the emergency that now beset him, Mr. Brock sat down placidly in his shirt sleeves on the side of his bed, and applied his mind to consider next whether the emergency itself was as serious as he had hitherto been inclined to think it.</s> <s sid="5" id="arma.c4.s5">Following this new way out of his perplexities, Mr. Brock found himself unexpectedly traveling to the end in view by the least inspiriting of all human journeys--a journey through the past years of his own life.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="arma.c4.p4"><s sid="6" id="arma.c4.s6">One by one the events of those years--all connected with the same little group of characters, and all more or less answerable for the anxiety which was now intruding itself between the clergyman and his night's rest--rose, in progressive series, on Mr. Brock's memory.</s> <s sid="7" id="arma.c4.s7">The first of the series took him back, through a period of fourteen years, to his own rectory on the Somersetshire shores of the Bristol Channel, and closeted him at a private interview with a lady who had paid him a visit in the character of a total stranger to the parson and the place.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="arma.c4.p5" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="arma.c4.s8">The lady's complexion was fair, the lady's figure was well preserved; she was still a young woman, and she looked even younger than her age.</s> <s sid="9" id="arma.c4.s9">There was a shade of melancholy in her expression, and an undertone of suffering in her voice--enough, in each case, to indicate that she had known trouble, but not enough to obtrude that trouble on the notice of others.</s> <s sid="10" id="arma.c4.s10">She brought with her a fine, fair-haired boy of eight years old, whom she presented as her son, and who was sent out of the way, at the beginning of the interview, to amuse himself in the rectory garden.</s> <s sid="11" id="arma.c4.s11">Her card had preceded her entrance into the study, and had announced her under the name of <qs/>"Mrs. Armadale."<qe/></s> <s sid="12" id="arma.c4.s12">Mr. Brock began to feel interested in her before she had opened her lips; and when the son had been dismissed, he awaited with some anxiety to hear what the mother had to say to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="arma.c4.p6"><s sid="13" id="arma.c4.s13">Mrs. Armadale began by informing the rector that she was a widow.</s> <s sid="14" id="arma.c4.s14">Her husband had perished by shipwreck a short time after their union, on the voyage from Madeira to Lisbon.</s> <s sid="15" id="arma.c4.s15">She had been brought to England, after her affliction, under her father's protection; and her child--a posthumous son--had been born on the family estate in Norfolk.</s> <s sid="16" id="arma.c4.s16">Her father's death, shortly afterward, had deprived her of her only surviving parent, and had exposed her to neglect and misconstruction on the part of her remaining relatives (two brothers), which had estranged her from them, she feared, for the rest of her days.</s> <s sid="17" id="arma.c4.s17">For some time past she had lived in the neighboring county of Devonshire, devoting herself to the education of her boy, who had now reached an age at which he required other than his mother's teaching.</s> <s sid="18" id="arma.c4.s18">Leaving out of the question her own unwillingness to part with him, in her solitary position, she was especially anxious that he should not be thrown among strangers by being sent to school.</s> <s sid="19" id="arma.c4.s19">Her darling project was to bring him up privately at home, and to keep him, as he advanced in years, from all contact with the temptations and the dangers of the world.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="arma.c4.p7"><s sid="20" id="arma.c4.s20">With these objects in view, her longer sojourn in her own locality (where the services of the resident clergyman, in the capacity of tutor, were not obtainable) must come to an end.</s> <s sid="21" id="arma.c4.s21">She had made inquiries, had heard of a house that would suit her in Mr. Brock's neighborhood, and had also been told that Mr. Brock himself had formerly been in the habit of taking pupils.</s> <s sid="22" id="arma.c4.s22">Possessed of this information, she had ventured to present herself, with references that vouched for her respectability, but without a formal introduction; and she had now to ask whether (in the event of her residing in the neighborhood) any terms that could be offered would induce Mr. Brock to open his doors once more to a pupil, and to allow that pupil to be her son.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="arma.c4.p8"><s sid="23" id="arma.c4.s23">If Mrs. Armadale had been a woman of no personal attractions, or if Mr. Brock had been provided with an intrenchment to fight behind in the shape of a wife, it is probable that the widow's journey might have been taken in vain.</s> <s sid="24" id="arma.c4.s24">As things really were, the rector examined the references which were offered to him, and asked time for consideration.</s> <s sid="25" id="arma.c4.s25">When the time had expired, he did what Mrs. Armadale wished him to do--he offered his back to the burden, and let the mother load him with the responsibility of the son.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="arma.c4.p9"><s sid="26" id="arma.c4.s26">This was the first event of the series; the date of it being the year eighteen hundred and thirty-seven.</s> <s sid="27" id="arma.c4.s27">Mr. Brock's memory, traveling forward toward the present from that point, picked up the second event in its turn, and stopped next at the year eighteen hundred and forty-five.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="arma.c4.p10"><s sid="28" id="arma.c4.s28">The fishing-village on the Somersetshire coast was still the scene, and the characters were once again--Mrs. Armadale and her son.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="arma.c4.p11"><s sid="29" id="arma.c4.s29">Through the eight years that had passed, Mr. Brock's responsibility had rested on him lightly enough.</s> <s sid="30" id="arma.c4.s30">The boy had given his mother and his tutor but little trouble.</s> <s sid="31" id="arma.c4.s31">He was certainly slow over his books, but more from a constitutional inability to fix his attention on his tasks than from want of capacity to understand them.</s> <s sid="32" id="arma.c4.s32">His temperament, it could not be denied, was heedless to the last degree: he acted recklessly on his first impulses, and rushed blindfold at all his conclusions.</s> <s sid="33" id="arma.c4.s33">On the other hand, it was to be said in his favor that his disposition was open as the day; a more generous, affectionate, sweet-tempered lad it would have been hard to find anywhere.</s> <s sid="34" id="arma.c4.s34">A certain quaint originality of character, and a natural healthiness in all his tastes, carried him free of most of the dangers to which his mother's system of education inevitably exposed him.</s> <s sid="35" id="arma.c4.s35">He had a thoroughly English love of the sea and of all that belongs to it; and as he grew in years, there was no luring him away from the water-side, and no keeping him out of the boat-builder's yard.</s> <s sid="36" id="arma.c4.s36">In course of time his mother caught him actually working there, to her infinite annoyance and surprise, as a volunteer.</s> <s sid="37" id="arma.c4.s37">He acknowledged that his whole future ambition was to have a yard of his own, and that his one present object was to learn to build a boat for himself.</s> <s sid="38" id="arma.c4.s38">Wisely foreseeing that such a pursuit as this for his leisure hours was exactly what was wanted to reconcile the lad to a position of isolation from companions of his own rank and age, Mr. Brock prevailed on Mrs. Armadale, with no small difficulty, to let her son have his way.</s> <s sid="39" id="arma.c4.s39">At the period of that second event in the clergyman's life with his pupil which is now to be related, young Armadale had practiced long enough in the builder's yard to have reached the summit of his wishes, by laying with his own hands the keel of his own boat.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="arma.c4.p12"><s sid="40" id="arma.c4.s40">Late on a certain summer day, not long after Allan had completed his sixteenth year, Mr. Brock left his pupil hard at work in the yard, and went to spend the evening with Mrs. Armadale, taking the _Times_ newspaper with him in his hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="arma.c4.p13"><s sid="41" id="arma.c4.s41">The years that had passed since they had first met had long since regulated the lives of the clergyman and his neighbor.</s> <s sid="42" id="arma.c4.s42">The first advances which Mr. Brock's growing admiration for the widow had led him to make in the early days of their intercourse had been met on her side by an appeal to his forbearance which had closed his lips for the future.</s> <s sid="43" id="arma.c4.s43">She had satisfied him, at once and forever, that the one place in her heart which he could hope to occupy was the place of a friend.</s> <s sid="44" id="arma.c4.s44">He loved her well enough to take what she would give him: friends they became, and friends they remained from that time forth.</s> <s sid="45" id="arma.c4.s45">No jealous dread of another man's succeeding where he had failed imbittered the clergyman's placid relations with the woman whom he loved.</s> <s sid="46" id="arma.c4.s46">Of the few resident gentlemen in the neighborhood, none were ever admitted by Mrs. Armadale to more than the merest acquaintance with her.</s> <s sid="47" id="arma.c4.s47">Contentedly self-buried in her country retreat, she was proof against every social attraction that would have tempted other women in her position and at her age.</s> <s sid="48" id="arma.c4.s48">Mr. Brock and his newspaper, appearing with monotonous regularity at her tea-table three times a week, told her all she knew or cared to know of the great outer world which circled round the narrow and changeless limits of her daily life.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="arma.c4.p14"><s sid="49" id="arma.c4.s49">On the evening in question Mr. Brock took the arm-chair in which he always sat, accepted the one cup of tea which he always drank, and opened the newspaper which he always read aloud to Mrs. Armadale, who invariably listened to him reclining on the same sofa, with the same sort of needle-work everlastingly in her hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="arma.c4.p15" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="arma.c4.s50"><qs/>"Bless my soul!"<qe/> cried the rector, with his voice in a new octave, and his eyes fixed in astonishment on the first page of the newspaper.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="arma.c4.p16"><s sid="51" id="arma.c4.s51">No such introduction to the evening readings as this had ever happened before in all Mrs. Armadale's experience as a listener.</s> <s sid="52" id="arma.c4.s52">She looked up from the sofa in a flutter of curiosity, and besought her reverend friend to favor her with an explanation.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="arma.c4.p17" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="arma.c4.s53"><qs/>"I can hardly believe my own eyes,"<qe/> said Mr. Brock.</s> <s sid="54" id="arma.c4.s54"><qs/>"Here is an advertisement, Mrs. Armadale, addressed to your son."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="arma.c4.p18"><s sid="55" id="arma.c4.s55">Without further preface, he read the advertisement as follows:</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="arma.c4.p19"><s sid="56" id="arma.c4.s56">IF this should meet the eye of ALLAN ARMADALE, he is desired to communicate, either personally or by letter, with Messrs.</s> <s sid="57" id="arma.c4.s57">Hammick and Ridge (Lincoln's Inn Fields, London), on business of importance which seriously concerns him.</s> <s sid="58" id="arma.c4.s58">Any one capable of informing Messrs.</s> <s sid="59" id="arma.c4.s59">E. and R. where the person herein advertised can be found would confer a favor by doing the same.</s> <s sid="60" id="arma.c4.s60">To prevent mistakes, it is further notified that the missing Allan Armadale is a youth aged fifteen years, and that this advertisement is inserted at the instance of his family and friends.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="arma.c4.p20" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="arma.c4.s61"><qs/>"Another family, and other friends,"<qe/> said Mrs. Armadale.</s> <s sid="62" id="arma.c4.s62"><qs/>"The person whose name appears in that advertisement is not my son."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="arma.c4.p21"><s sid="63" id="arma.c4.s63">The tone in which she spoke surprised Mr. Brock.</s> <s sid="64" id="arma.c4.s64">The change in her face, when he looked up, shocked him.</s> <s sid="65" id="arma.c4.s65">Her delicate complexion had faded away to a dull white; her eyes were averted from her visitor with a strange mixture of confusion and alarm; she looked an older woman than she was, by ten good years at least.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="arma.c4.p22" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="arma.c4.s66"><qs/>"The name is so very uncommon,"<qe/> said Mr. Brock, imagining he had offended her, and trying to excuse himself.</s> <s sid="67" id="arma.c4.s67"><qs/>"It really seemed impossible there could be two persons--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="arma.c4.p23" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="arma.c4.s68"><qs/>"There _are_ two,"<qe/> interposed Mrs. Armadale.</s> <s sid="69" id="arma.c4.s69"><qs/>"Allan, as you know, is sixteen years old.</s> <s sid="70" id="arma.c4.s70">If you look back at the advertisement, you will find the missing person described as being only fifteen.</s> <s sid="71" id="arma.c4.s71">Although he bears the same surname and the same Christian name, he is, I thank God, in no way whatever related to my son.</s> <s sid="72" id="arma.c4.s72">As long as I live, it will be the object of my hopes and prayers that Allan may never see him, may never even hear of him.</s> <s sid="73" id="arma.c4.s73">My kind friend, I see I surprise you: will you bear with me if I leave these strange circumstances unexplained?</s> <s sid="74" id="arma.c4.s74">There is past misfortune and misery in my early life too painful for me to speak of, even to _you_.</s> <s sid="75" id="arma.c4.s75">Will you help me to bear the remembrance of it, by never referring to this again?</s> <s sid="76" id="arma.c4.s76">Will you do even more--will you promise not to speak of it to Allan, and not to let that newspaper fall in his way?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="arma.c4.p24"><s sid="77" id="arma.c4.s77">Mr. Brock gave the pledge required of him, and considerately left her to herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="arma.c4.p25"><s sid="78" id="arma.c4.s78">The rector had been too long and too truly attached to Mrs. Armadale to be capable of regarding her with any unworthy distrust.</s> <s sid="79" id="arma.c4.s79">But it would be idle to deny that he felt disappointed by her want of confidence in him, and that he looked inquisitively at the advertisement more than once on his way back to his own house.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="arma.c4.p26"><s sid="80" id="arma.c4.s80">It was clear enough, now, that Mrs. Armadale's motives for burying her son as well as herself in the seclusion of a remote country village was not so much to keep him under her own eye as to keep him from discovery by his namesake.</s> <s sid="81" id="arma.c4.s81">Why did she dread the idea of their ever meeting?</s> <s sid="82" id="arma.c4.s82">Was it a dread for herself, or a dread for her son?</s> <s sid="83" id="arma.c4.s83">Mr. Brock's loyal belief in his friend rejected any solution of the difficulty which pointed at some past misconduct of Mrs. Armadale's.</s> <s sid="84" id="arma.c4.s84">That night he destroyed the advertisement with his own hand; that night he resolved that the subject should never be suffered to enter his mind again.</s> <s sid="85" id="arma.c4.s85">There was another Allan Armadale about the world, a stranger to his pupil's blood, and a vagabond advertised in the public newspapers.</s> <s sid="86" id="arma.c4.s86">So much accident had revealed to him.</s> <s sid="87" id="arma.c4.s87">More, for Mrs. Armadale's sake, he had no wish to discover--and more he would never seek to know.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="arma.c4.p27"><s sid="88" id="arma.c4.s88">This was the second in the series of events which dated from the rector's connection with Mrs. Armadale and her son.</s> <s sid="89" id="arma.c4.s89">Mr. Brock's memory, traveling on nearer and nearer to present circumstances, reached the third stage of its journey through the by-gone time, and stopped at the year eighteen hundred and fifty, next.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="arma.c4.p28" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="arma.c4.s90">The five years that had passed had made little if any change in Allan's character.</s> <s sid="91" id="arma.c4.s91">He had simply developed (to use his tutor's own expression) from a boy of sixteen to a boy of twenty-one.</s> <s sid="92" id="arma.c4.s92">He was just as easy and open in his disposition as ever; just as quaintly and inveterately good-humored; just as heedless in following his own impulses, lead him where they might.</s> <s sid="93" id="arma.c4.s93">His bias toward the sea had strengthened with his advance to the years of manhood.</s> <s sid="94" id="arma.c4.s94">From building a boat, he had now got on--with two journeymen at work under him--to building a decked vessel of five-and-thirty tons.</s> <s sid="95" id="arma.c4.s95">Mr. Brock had conscientiously tried to divert him to higher aspirations; had taken him to Oxford, to see what college life was like; had taken him to London, to expand his mind by the spectacle of the great metropolis.</s> <s sid="96" id="arma.c4.s96">The change had diverted Allan, but had not altered him in the least.</s> <s sid="97" id="arma.c4.s97">He was as impenetrably superior to all worldly ambition as Diogenes himself.</s> <s sid="98" id="arma.c4.s98"><qs/>"Which is best,"<qe/><sss/> asked this unconscious philosopher, <sse/><qs/>"to find out the way to be happy for yourself, or to let other people try if they can find it out for you?"<qe/></s> <s sid="99" id="arma.c4.s99">From that moment Mr. Brock permitted his pupil's character to grow at its own rate of development, and Allan went on uninterruptedly with the work of his yacht.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="arma.c4.p29"><s sid="100" id="arma.c4.s100">Time, which had wrought so little change in the son, had not passed harmless over the mother.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="arma.c4.p30"><s sid="101" id="arma.c4.s101">Mrs. Armadale's health was breaking fast.</s> <s sid="102" id="arma.c4.s102">As her strength failed, her temper altered for the worse: she grew more and more fretful, more and more subject to morbid fears and fancies, more and more reluctant to leave her own room.</s> <s sid="103" id="arma.c4.s103">Since the appearance of the advertisement five years since, nothing had happened to force her memory back to the painful associations connected with her early life.</s> <s sid="104" id="arma.c4.s104">No word more on the forbidden topic had passed between the rector and herself; no suspicion had ever been raised in Allan's mind of the existence of his namesake; and yet, without the shadow of a reason for any special anxiety, Mrs. Armadale had become, of late years, obstinately and fretfully uneasy on the subject of her son.</s> <s sid="105" id="arma.c4.s105">More than once Mr. Brock dreaded a serious disagreement between them; but Allan's natural sweetness of temper, fortified by his love for his mother, carried him triumphantly through all trials.</s> <s sid="106" id="arma.c4.s106">Not a hard word or a harsh look ever escaped him in her presence; he was unchangeably loving and forbearing with her to the very last.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="arma.c4.p31"><s sid="107" id="arma.c4.s107">Such were the positions of the son, the mother, and the friend, when the next notable event happened in the lives of the three.</s> <s sid="108" id="arma.c4.s108">On a dreary afternoon, early in the month of November, Mr. Brock was disturbed over the composition of his sermon by a visit from the landlord of the village inn.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="arma.c4.p32"><s sid="109" id="arma.c4.s109">After making his introductory apologies, the landlord stated the urgent business on which he had come to the rectory clearly enough.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="arma.c4.p33"><s sid="110" id="arma.c4.s110">A few hours since a young man had been brought to the inn by some farm laborers in the neighborhood, who had found him wandering about one of their master's fields in a disordered state of mind, which looked to their eyes like downright madness.</s> <s sid="111" id="arma.c4.s111">The landlord had given the poor creature shelter while he sent for medical help; and the doctor, on seeing him, had pronounced that he was suffering from fever on the brain, and that his removal to the nearest town at which a hospital or a work-house infirmary could be found to receive him would in all probability be fatal to his chances of recovery.</s> <s sid="112" id="arma.c4.s112">After hearing this expression of opinion, and after observing for himself that the stranger's only luggage consisted of a small carpet-bag which had been found in the field near him, the landlord had set off on the spot to consult the rector, and to ask, in this serious emergency, what course he was to take next.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER III. DAY AND NIGHT</title>

<p pid="1" id="arma.c6.p1"><s sid="1" id="arma.c6.s1">The morning hours had passed; the noon had come and gone; and Mr. Brock had started on the first stage of his journey home.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="arma.c6.p2"><s sid="2" id="arma.c6.s2">After parting from the rector in Douglas Harbor, the two young men had returned to Castletown, and had there separated at the hotel door, Allan walking down to the waterside to look after his yacht, and Midwinter entering the house to get the rest that he needed after a sleepless night.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="arma.c6.p3"><s sid="3" id="arma.c6.s3">He darkened his room; he closed his eyes, but no sleep came to him.</s> <s sid="4" id="arma.c6.s4">On this first day of the rector's absence, his sensitive nature extravagantly exaggerated the responsibility which he now held in trust for Mr. Brock.</s> <s sid="5" id="arma.c6.s5">A nervous dread of leaving Allan by himself, even for a few hours only, kept him waking and doubting, until it became a relief rather than a hardship to rise from the bed again, and, following in Allan's footsteps, to take the way to the waterside which led to the yacht.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="arma.c6.p4"><s sid="6" id="arma.c6.s6">The repairs of the little vessel were nearly completed.</s> <s sid="7" id="arma.c6.s7">It was a breezy, cheerful day; the land was bright, the water was blue, the quick waves leaped crisply in the sunshine, the men were singing at their work.</s> <s sid="8" id="arma.c6.s8">Descending to the cabin, Midwinter discovered his friend busily occupied in attempting to set the place to rights.</s> <s sid="9" id="arma.c6.s9">Habitually the least systematic of mortals, Allan now and then awoke to an overwhelming sense of the advantages of order, and on such occasions a perfect frenzy of tidiness possessed him.</s> <s sid="10" id="arma.c6.s10">He was down on his knees, hotly and wildly at work, when Midwinter looked in on him; and was fast reducing the neat little world of the cabin to its original elements of chaos, with a misdirected energy wonderful to see.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="arma.c6.p5" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="arma.c6.s11"><qs/>"Here's a mess!"<qe/> said Allan, rising composedly on the horizon of his own accumulated litter.</s> <s sid="12" id="arma.c6.s12"><qs/>"Do you know, my dear fellow, I begin to wish I had let well alone!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="arma.c6.p6"><s sid="13" id="arma.c6.s13">Midwinter smiled, and came to his friend's assistance with the natural neat-handedness of a sailor.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="arma.c6.p7"><s sid="14" id="arma.c6.s14">The first object that he encountered was Allan's dressing-case, turned upside down, with half the contents scattered on the floor, and with a duster and a hearth-broom lying among them.</s> <s sid="15" id="arma.c6.s15">Replacing the various objects which formed the furniture of the dressing-case one by one, Midwinter lighted unexpectedly on a miniature portrait, of the old-fashioned oval form, primly framed in a setting of small diamonds.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="arma.c6.p8" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="arma.c6.s16"><qs/>"You don't seem to set much value on this,"<qe/> he said.</s> <s sid="17" id="arma.c6.s17"><qs/>"What is it?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="arma.c6.p9" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="arma.c6.s18">Allan bent over him, and looked at the miniature.</s> <s sid="19" id="arma.c6.s19"><qs/>"It belonged to my mother,"<qe/><sss/> he answered; <sse/><qs/>"and I set the greatest value on it.</s> <s sid="20" id="arma.c6.s20">It is a portrait of my father."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="arma.c6.p10"><s sid="21" id="arma.c6.s21">Midwinter put the miniature abruptly, into Allan's hands, and withdrew to the opposite side of the cabin.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="arma.c6.p11" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="arma.c6.s22"><qs/>"You know best where the things ought to be put in your own dressing-case,"<qe/> he said, keeping his back turned on Allan.</s> <s sid="23" id="arma.c6.s23"><qs/>"I'll make the place tidy on this side of the cabin, and you shall make the place tidy on the other."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="arma.c6.p12"><s sid="24" id="arma.c6.s24">He began setting in order the litter scattered about him on the cabin table and on the floor.</s> <s sid="25" id="arma.c6.s25">But it seemed as if fate had decided that his friend's personal possessions should fall into his hands that morning, employ them where he might.</s> <s sid="26" id="arma.c6.s26">One among the first objects which he took up was Allan's tobacco jar, with the stopper missing, and with a letter (which appeared by the bulk of it to contain inclosures) crumpled into the mouth of the jar in the stopper's place.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="arma.c6.p13" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="arma.c6.s27"><qs/>"Did you know that you had put this here?"<qe/> he asked.</s> <s sid="28" id="arma.c6.s28"><qs/>"Is the letter of any importance?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="arma.c6.p14" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="arma.c6.s29">Allan recognized it instantly.</s> <s sid="30" id="arma.c6.s30">It was the first of the little series of letters which had followed the cruising party to the Isle of Man--the letter which young Armadale had briefly referred to as bringing him <qs/>"more worries from those everlasting lawyers,"<qe/> and had then dismissed from further notice as recklessly as usual.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="arma.c6.p15" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="arma.c6.s31"><qs/>"This is what comes of being particularly careful,"<qe/><sss/> said Allan; <sse/><qs/>"here is an instance of my extreme thoughtfulness.</s> <s sid="32" id="arma.c6.s32">You may not think it but I put the letter there on purpose.</s> <s sid="33" id="arma.c6.s33">Every time I went to the jar, you know, I was sure to see the letter; and every time I saw the letter, I was sure to say to myself, <alt-qs/>'This must be answered.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="34" id="arma.c6.s34">There's nothing to laugh at; it was a perfectly sensible arrangement, if I could only have remembered where I put the jar.</s> <s sid="35" id="arma.c6.s35">Suppose I tie a knot in my pocket-handkerchief this time?</s> <s sid="36" id="arma.c6.s36">You have a wonderful memory, my dear fellow.</s> <s sid="37" id="arma.c6.s37">Perhaps you'll remind me in the course of the day, in case I forget the knot next."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="arma.c6.p16"><s sid="38" id="arma.c6.s38">Midwinter saw his first chance, since Mr. Brock's departure, of usefully filling Mr. Brock's place.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="arma.c6.p17" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="arma.c6.s39"><qs/>"Here is your writing-case,"<qe/><sss/> he said; <sse/><qs/>"why not answer the letter at once?</s> <s sid="40" id="arma.c6.s40">If you put it away again, you may forget it again."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="arma.c6.p18" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="arma.c6.s41"><qs/>"Very true,"<qe/> returned Allan.</s> <s sid="42" id="arma.c6.s42"><qs/>"But the worst of it is, I can't quite make up my mind what answer to write.</s> <s sid="43" id="arma.c6.s43">I want a word of advice.</s> <s sid="44" id="arma.c6.s44">Come and sit down here, and I'll tell you all about it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="arma.c6.p19"><s sid="45" id="arma.c6.s45">With his loud boyish laugh--echoed by Midwinter, who caught the infection of his gayety--he swept a heap of miscellaneous incumbrances off the cabin sofa, and made room for his friend and himself to take their places.</s> <s sid="46" id="arma.c6.s46">In the high flow of youthful spirits, the two sat down to their trifling consultation over a letter lost in a tobacco jar.</s> <s sid="47" id="arma.c6.s47">It was a memorable moment to both of them, lightly as they thought of it at the time.</s> <s sid="48" id="arma.c6.s48">Before they had risen again from their places, they had taken the first irrevocable step together on the dark and tortuous road of their future lives.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="arma.c6.p20"><s sid="49" id="arma.c6.s49">Reduced to plain facts, the question on which Allan now required his friend's advice may be stated as follows:</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="arma.c6.p21"><s sid="50" id="arma.c6.s50">While the various arrangements connected with the succession to Thorpe Ambrose were in progress of settlement, and while the new possessor of the estate was still in London, a question had necessarily arisen relating to the person who should be appointed to manage the property.</s> <s sid="51" id="arma.c6.s51">The steward employed by the Blanchard family had written, without loss of time, to offer his services.</s> <s sid="52" id="arma.c6.s52">Although a perfectly competent and trustworthy man, he failed to find favor in the eyes of the new proprietor.</s> <s sid="53" id="arma.c6.s53">Acting, as usual, on his first impulses, and resolved, at all hazards, to install Midwinter as a permanent inmate at Thorpe Ambrose, Allan had determined that the steward's place was the place exactly fitted for his friend, for the simple reason that it would necessarily oblige his friend to live with him on the estate.</s> <s sid="54" id="arma.c6.s54">He had accordingly written to decline the proposal made to him without consulting Mr. Brock, whose disapproval he had good reason to fear; and without telling Midwinter, who would probably (if a chance were allowed him of choosing) have declined taking a situation which his previous training had by no means fitted him to fill.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="arma.c6.p22"><s sid="55" id="arma.c6.s55">Further correspondence had followed this decision, and had raised two new difficulties which looked a little embarrassing on the face of them, but which Allan, with the assistance of his lawyer, easily contrived to solve.</s> <s sid="56" id="arma.c6.s56">The first difficulty, of examining the outgoing steward's books, was settled by sending a professional accountant to Thorpe Ambrose; and the second difficulty, of putting the steward's empty cottage to some profitable use (Allan's plans for his friend comprehending Midwinter's residence under his own roof), was met by placing the cottage on the list of an active house agent in the neighboring county town.</s> <s sid="57" id="arma.c6.s57">In this state the arrangements had been left when Allan quitted London.</s> <s sid="58" id="arma.c6.s58">He had heard and thought nothing more of the matter, until a letter from his lawyers had followed him to the Isle of Man, inclosing two proposals to occupy the cottage, both received on the same day, and requesting to hear, at his earliest convenience, which of the two he was prepared to accept.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="arma.c6.p23"><s sid="59" id="arma.c6.s59">Finding himself, after having conveniently forgotten the subject for some days past, placed face to face once more with the necessity for decision, Allan now put the two proposals into his friend's hands, and, after a rambling explanation of the circumstances of the case, requested to be favored with a word of advice.</s> <s sid="60" id="arma.c6.s60">Instead of examining the proposals, Midwinter unceremoniously put them aside, and asked the two very natural and very awkward questions of who the new steward was to be, and why he was to live in Allan's house?</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="arma.c6.p24" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="arma.c6.s61"><qs/>"I'll tell you who, and I'll tell you why, when we get to Thorpe Ambrose,"<qe/> said Allan.</s> <s sid="62" id="arma.c6.s62"><qs/>"In the meantime we'll call the steward X. Y.</s> <s sid="63" id="arma.c6.s63">Z., and we'll say he lives with me, because I'm devilish sharp, and I mean to keep him under my own eye.</s> <s sid="64" id="arma.c6.s64">You needn't look surprised.</s> <s sid="65" id="arma.c6.s65">I know the man thoroughly well; he requires a good deal of management.</s> <s sid="66" id="arma.c6.s66">If I offered him the steward's place beforehand, his modesty would get in his way, and he would say <alt-qs/>'No.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="67" id="arma.c6.s67">If I pitch him into it neck and crop, without a word of warning and with nobody at hand to relieve him of the situation, he'll have nothing for it but to consult my interests, and say <alt-qs/>'Yes.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="68" id="arma.c6.s68">X. Y.</s> <s sid="69" id="arma.c6.s69">Z. is not at all a bad fellow, I can tell you.</s> <s sid="70" id="arma.c6.s70">You'll see him when we go to Thorpe Ambrose; and I rather think you and he will get on uncommonly well together."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="arma.c6.p25"><s sid="71" id="arma.c6.s71">The humorous twinkle in Allan's eye, the sly significance in Allan's voice, would have betrayed his secret to a prosperous man.</s> <s sid="72" id="arma.c6.s72">Midwinter was as far from suspecting it as the carpenters who were at work above them on the deck of the yacht.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="arma.c6.p26" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="arma.c6.s73"><qs/>"Is there no steward now on the estate?"<qe/> he asked, his face showing plainly that he was far from feeling satisfied with Allan's answer.</s> <s sid="74" id="arma.c6.s74"><qs/>"Is the business neglected all this time?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="arma.c6.p27" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="arma.c6.s75"><qs/>"Nothing of the sort!"<qe/> returned Allan.</s> <s sid="76" id="arma.c6.s76"><qs/>"The business is going with <alt-qs/>'a wet sheet and a flowing sea, and a wind that follows free.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="77" id="arma.c6.s77">I'm not joking; I'm only metaphorical.</s> <s sid="78" id="arma.c6.s78">A regular accountant has poked his nose into the books, and a steady-going lawyer's clerk attends at the office once a week.</s> <s sid="79" id="arma.c6.s79">That doesn't look like neglect, does it?</s> <s sid="80" id="arma.c6.s80">Leave the new steward alone for the present, and just tell me which of those two tenants you would take, if you were in my place."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="arma.c6.p28"><s sid="81" id="arma.c6.s81">Midwinter opened the proposals, and read them attentively.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="arma.c6.p29"><s sid="82" id="arma.c6.s82">The first proposal was from no less a person than the solicitor at Thorpe Ambrose, who had first informed Allan at Paris of the large fortune that had fallen into his hands.</s> <s sid="83" id="arma.c6.s83">This gentleman wrote personally to say that he had long admired the cottage, which was charmingly situated within the limits of the Thorpe Ambrose grounds.</s> <s sid="84" id="arma.c6.s84">He was a bachelor, of studious habits, desirous of retiring to a country seclusion after the wear and tear of his business hours; and he ventured to say that Mr. Armadale, in accepting him as a tenant, might count on securing an unobtrusive neighbor, and on putting the cottage into responsible and careful hands.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="arma.c6.p30"><s sid="85" id="arma.c6.s85">The second proposal came through the house agent, and proceeded from a total stranger.</s> <s sid="86" id="arma.c6.s86">The tenant who offered for the cottage, in this case, was a retired officer in the army--one Major Milroy.</s> <s sid="87" id="arma.c6.s87">His family merely consisted of an invalid wife and an only child--a young lady.</s> <s sid="88" id="arma.c6.s88">His references were unexceptionable; and he, too, was especially anxious to secure the cottage, as the perfect quiet of the situation was exactly what was required by Mrs. Milroy in her feeble state of health.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="arma.c6.p31" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="arma.c6.s89"><qs/>"Well, which profession shall I favor?"<qe/> asked Allan.</s> <s sid="90" id="arma.c6.s90"><qs/>"The army or the law?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="arma.c6.p32" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="arma.c6.s91"><qs/>"There seems to me to be no doubt about it,"<qe/> said Midwinter.</s> <s sid="92" id="arma.c6.s92"><qs/>"The lawyer has been already in correspondence with you; and the lawyer's claim is, therefore, the claim to be preferred."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="arma.c9.p4"><s sid="5" id="arma.c9.s5">"DEAR MR.</s> <s sid="6" id="arma.c9.s6">BROCK--Only an hour since we reached this house, just as the servants were locking up for the night.</s> <s sid="7" id="arma.c9.s7">Allan has gone to bed, worn out by our long day's journey, and has left me in the room they call the library, to tell you the story of our journey to Norfolk.</s> <s sid="8" id="arma.c9.s8">Being better seasoned than he is to fatigues of all kinds, my eyes are quite wakeful enough for writing a letter, though the clock on the chimney-piece points to midnight, and we have been traveling since ten in the morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="arma.c9.p5"><s sid="9" id="arma.c9.s9">"The last news you had of us was news sent by Allan from the Isle of Man.</s> <s sid="10" id="arma.c9.s10">If I am not mistaken, he wrote to tell you of the night we passed on board the wrecked ship.</s> <s sid="11" id="arma.c9.s11">Forgive me, dear Mr. Brock, if I say nothing on that subject until time has helped me to think of it with a quieter mind.</s> <s sid="12" id="arma.c9.s12">The hard fight against myself must all be fought over again; but I will win it yet, please God; I will, indeed.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="arma.c9.p6"><s sid="13" id="arma.c9.s13">"There is no need to trouble you with any account of our journeyings about the northern and western districts of the island, or of the short cruises we took when the repairs of the yacht were at last complete.</s> <s sid="14" id="arma.c9.s14">It will be better if I get on at once to the morning of yesterday, the fourteenth.</s> <s sid="15" id="arma.c9.s15">We had come in with the night-tide to Douglas Harbor, and, as soon as the post-office was open; Allan, by my advice, sent on shore for letters.</s> <s sid="16" id="arma.c9.s16">The messenger returned with one letter only, and the writer of it proved to be the former mistress of Thorpe Ambrose--Mrs. Blanchard.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="arma.c9.p7"><s sid="17" id="arma.c9.s17">"You ought to be informed, I think, of the contents of this letter, for it has seriously influenced Allan's plans.</s> <s sid="18" id="arma.c9.s18">He loses everything, sooner or later, as you know, and he has lost the letter already.</s> <s sid="19" id="arma.c9.s19">So I must give you the substance of what Mrs. Blanchard wrote to him, as plainly as I can.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="arma.c9.p8"><s sid="20" id="arma.c9.s20">"The first page announced the departure of the ladies from Thorpe Ambrose.</s> <s sid="21" id="arma.c9.s21">They left on the day before yesterday, the thirteenth, having, after much hesitation, finally decided on going abroad, to visit some old friends settled in Italy, in the neighborhood of Florence.</s> <s sid="22" id="arma.c9.s22">It appears to be quite possible that Mrs. Blanchard and her niece may settle there, too, if they can find a suitable house and grounds to let.</s> <s sid="23" id="arma.c9.s23">They both like the Italian country and the Italian people, and they are well enough off to please themselves.</s> <s sid="24" id="arma.c9.s24">The elder lady has her jointure, and the younger is in possession of all her father's fortune.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="arma.c9.p9"><s sid="25" id="arma.c9.s25">"The next page of the letter was, in Allan's opinion, far from a pleasant page to read.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="arma.c9.p10"><s sid="26" id="arma.c9.s26">"After referring, in the most grateful terms, to the kindness which had left her niece and herself free to leave their old home at their own time, Mrs. Blanchard added that Allan's considerate conduct had produced such a strongly favorable impression among the friends and dependents of the family that they were desirous of giving him a public reception on his arrival among them.</s> <s sid="27" id="arma.c9.s27">A preliminary meeting of the tenants on the estate and the principal persons in the neighboring town had already been held to discuss the arrangements, and a letter might be expected shortly from the clergyman inquiring when it would suit Mr. Armadale's convenience to take possession personally and publicly of his estates in Norfolk.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="arma.c9.p11"><s sid="28" id="arma.c9.s28">"You will now be able to guess the cause of our sudden departure from the Isle of Man.</s> <s sid="29" id="arma.c9.s29">The first and foremost idea in your old pupil's mind, as soon as he had read Mrs. Blanchard's account of the proceedings at the meeting, was the idea of escaping the public reception, and the one certain way he could see of avoiding it was to start for Thorpe Ambrose before the clergyman's letter could reach him.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="arma.c9.p12"><s sid="30" id="arma.c9.s30">"I tried hard to make him think a little before he acted an his first impulse in this matter; but he only went on packing his portmanteau in his own impenetrably good-humored way.</s> <s sid="31" id="arma.c9.s31">In ten minutes his luggage was ready, and in five minutes more he had given the crew their directions for taking the yacht back to Somersetshire.</s> <s sid="32" id="arma.c9.s32">The steamer to Liverpool was alongside of us in the harbor, and I had really no choice but to go on board with him or to let him go by himself.</s> <s sid="33" id="arma.c9.s33">I spare you the account of our stormy voyage, of our detention at Liverpool, and of the trains we missed on our journey across the country.</s> <s sid="34" id="arma.c9.s34">You know that we have got here safely, and that is enough.</s> <s sid="35" id="arma.c9.s35">What the servants think of the new squire's sudden appearance among them, without a word of warning, is of no great consequence.</s> <s sid="36" id="arma.c9.s36">What the committee for arranging the public reception may think of it when the news flies abroad to-morrow is, I am afraid, a more serious matter.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="arma.c9.p13"><s sid="37" id="arma.c9.s37">"Having already mentioned the servants, I may proceed to tell you that the latter part of Mrs. Blanchard's letter was entirely devoted to instructing Allan on the subject of the domestic establishment which she has left behind her.</s> <s sid="38" id="arma.c9.s38">It seems that all the servants, indoors and out (with three exceptions), are waiting here, on the chance that Allan will continue them in their places.</s> <s sid="39" id="arma.c9.s39">Two of these exceptions are readily accounted for:</s> <s sid="40" id="arma.c9.s40">Mrs. Blanchard's maid and Miss Blanchard's maid go abroad with their mistresses.</s> <s sid="41" id="arma.c9.s41">The third exceptional case is the case of the upper housemaid; and here there is a little hitch.</s> <s sid="42" id="arma.c9.s42">In plain words, the housemaid has been sent away at a moment's notice, for what Mrs. Blanchard rather mysteriously describes as <alt-qs/>'levity of conduct with a stranger.'<alt-qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="arma.c9.p14"><s sid="43" id="arma.c9.s43">"I am afraid you will laugh at me, but I must confess the truth.</s> <s sid="44" id="arma.c9.s44">I have been made so distrustful (after what happened to us in the Isle of Man) of even the most trifling misadventures which connect themselves in any way with Allan's introduction to his new life and prospects, that I have already questioned one of the men-servants here about this apparently unimportant matter of the housemaid's going away in disgrace.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="arma.c9.p15"><s sid="45" id="arma.c9.s45">"All I can learn is that a strange man had been noticed hanging suspiciously about the grounds; that the housemaid was so ugly a woman as to render it next to a certainty that he had some underhand purpose to serve in making himself agreeable to her; and that he has not as yet been seen again in the neighborhood since the day of her dismissal.</s> <s sid="46" id="arma.c9.s46">So much for the one servant who has been turned out at Thorpe Ambrose.</s> <s sid="47" id="arma.c9.s47">I can only hope there is no trouble for Allan brewing in that quarter.</s> <s sid="48" id="arma.c9.s48">As for the other servants who remain, Mrs. Blanchard describes them, both men and women, as perfectly trustworthy, and they will all, no doubt, continue to occupy their present places.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="arma.c9.p16"><s sid="49" id="arma.c9.s49">"Having now done with Mrs. Blanchard's letter, my next duty is to beg you, in Allan's name and with Allan's love, to come here and stay with him at the earliest moment when you can leave Somersetshire.</s> <s sid="50" id="arma.c9.s50">Although I cannot presume to think that my own wishes will have any special influence in determining you to accept this invitation, I must nevertheless acknowledge that I have a reason of my own for earnestly desiring to see you here.</s> <s sid="51" id="arma.c9.s51">Allan has innocently caused me a new anxiety about my future relations with him, and I sorely need your advice to show me the right way of setting that anxiety at rest.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="arma.c9.p17"><s sid="52" id="arma.c9.s52">"The difficulty which now perplexes me relates to the steward's place at Thorpe Ambrose.</s> <s sid="53" id="arma.c9.s53">Before to-day I only knew that Allan had hit on some plan of his own for dealing with this matter, rather strangely involving, among other results, the letting of the cottage which was the old steward's place of abode, in consequence of the new steward's contemplated residence in the great house.</s> <s sid="54" id="arma.c9.s54">A chance word in our conversation on the journey here led Allan into speaking out more plainly than he had spoken yet, and I heard to my unutterable astonishment that the person who was at the bottom of the whole arrangement about the steward was no other than myself!</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="arma.c9.p18"><s sid="55" id="arma.c9.s55">"It is needless to tell you how I felt this new instance of Allan's kindness.</s> <s sid="56" id="arma.c9.s56">The first pleasure of hearing from his own lips that I had deserved the strongest proof he could give of his confidence in me was soon dashed by the pain which mixes itself with all pleasure--at least, with all that I have ever known.</s> <s sid="57" id="arma.c9.s57">Never has my past life seemed so dreary to look back on as it seems now, when I feel how entirely it has unfitted me to take the place of all others that I should have liked to occupy in my friend's service.</s> <s sid="58" id="arma.c9.s58">I mustered courage to tell him that I had none of the business knowledge and business experience which his steward ought to possess.</s> <s sid="59" id="arma.c9.s59">He generously met the objection by telling me that I could learn; and he has promised to send to London for the person who has already been employed for the time being in the steward's office, and who will, therefore, be perfectly competent to teach me.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="arma.c9.p19"><s sid="60" id="arma.c9.s60">"Do you, too, think I can learn?</s> <s sid="61" id="arma.c9.s61">If you do, I will work day and night to instruct myself.</s> <s sid="62" id="arma.c9.s62">But if (as I am afraid) the steward's duties are of far too serious a kind to be learned off-hand by a man so young and so inexperienced as I am, then pray hasten your journey to Thorpe Ambrose, and exert your influence over Allan personally.</s> <s sid="63" id="arma.c9.s63">Nothing less will induce him to pass me over, and to employ a steward who is really fit to take the place.</s> <s sid="64" id="arma.c9.s64">Pray, pray act in this matter as you think best for Allan's interests.</s> <s sid="65" id="arma.c9.s65">Whatever disappointment I may feel, _he_ shall not see it.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="arma.c16.p9"><s sid="34" id="arma.c16.s34">The scene through which the picnic party was now passing merited far more attention than it received either from Allan or Allan's friends.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="arma.c22.p10"><s sid="41" id="arma.c22.s41">She had married the major at an unusually early age; and, in marrying him, had taken a man for her husband who was old enough to be her father--a man who, at that time, had the reputation, and not unjustly, of having made the freest use of his social gifts and his advantages of personal appearance in the society of women.</s> <s sid="42" id="arma.c22.s42">Indifferently educated, and below her husband in station, she had begun by accepting his addresses under the influence of her own flattered vanity, and had ended by feeling the fascination which Major Milroy had exercised over women infinitely her mental superiors in his earlier life.</s> <s sid="43" id="arma.c22.s43">He had been touched, on his side, by her devotion, and had felt, in his turn, the attraction of her beauty, her freshness, and her youth.</s> <s sid="44" id="arma.c22.s44">Up to the time when their little daughter and only child had reached the age of eight years, their married life had been an unusually happy one.</s> <s sid="45" id="arma.c22.s45">At that period the double misfortune fell on the household, of the failure of the wife's health, and the almost total loss of the husband's fortune; and from that moment the domestic happiness of the married pair was virtually at an end.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="arma.c22.p11"><s sid="46" id="arma.c22.s46">Having reached the age when men in general are readier, under the pressure of calamity, to resign themselves than to resist, the major had secured the little relics of his property, had retired into the country, and had patiently taken refuge in his mechanical pursuits.</s> <s sid="47" id="arma.c22.s47">A woman nearer to him in age, or a woman with a better training and more patience of disposition than his wife possessed, would have understood the major's conduct, and have found consolation in the major's submission.</s> <s sid="48" id="arma.c22.s48">Mrs. Milroy found consolation in nothing.</s> <s sid="49" id="arma.c22.s49">Neither nature nor training helped her to meet resignedly the cruel calamity which had struck at her in the bloom of womanhood and the prime of beauty.</s> <s sid="50" id="arma.c22.s50">The curse of incurable sickness blighted her at once and for life.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="arma.c22.p12"><s sid="51" id="arma.c22.s51">Suffering can, and does, develop the latent evil that there is in humanity, as well as the latent good.</s> <s sid="52" id="arma.c22.s52">The good that was in Mrs. Milroy's nature shrank up, under that subtly deteriorating influence in which the evil grew and flourished.</s> <s sid="53" id="arma.c22.s53">Month by month, as she became the weaker woman physically, she became the worse woman morally.</s> <s sid="54" id="arma.c22.s54">All that was mean, cruel, and false in her expanded in steady proportion to the contraction of all that had once been generous, gentle, and true.</s> <s sid="55" id="arma.c22.s55">Old suspicions of her husband's readiness to relapse into the irregularities of his bachelor life, which, in her healthier days of mind and body, she had openly confessed to him--which she had always sooner or later seen to be suspicions that he had not deserved--came back, now that sickness had divorced her from him, in the form of that baser conjugal distrust which keeps itself cunningly secret; which gathers together its inflammatory particles atom by atom into a heap, and sets the slowly burning frenzy of jealousy alight in the mind.</s> <s sid="56" id="arma.c22.s56">No proof of her husband's blameless and patient life that could now be shown to Mrs. Milroy; no appeal that could be made to her respect for herself, or for her child growing up to womanhood, availed to dissipate the terrible delusion born of her hopeless illness, and growing steadily with its growth.</s> <s sid="57" id="arma.c22.s57">Like all other madness, it had its ebb and flow, its time of spasmodic outburst, and its time of deceitful repose; but, active or passive, it was always in her.</s> <s sid="58" id="arma.c22.s58">It had injured innocent servants, and insulted blameless strangers.</s> <s sid="59" id="arma.c22.s59">It had brought the first tears of shame and sorrow into her daughter's eyes, and had set the deepest lines that scored it in her husband's face.</s> <s sid="60" id="arma.c22.s60">It had made the secret misery of the little household for years; and it was now to pass beyond the family limits, and to influence coming events at Thorpe Ambrose, in which the future interests of Allan and Allan's friend were vitally concerned.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="arma.c26.p3"><s sid="3" id="arma.c26.s3">Allowing for the difference in their ages, the son was, in this instance, so accurately the reflection of the father, that an acquaintance with either of the two Pedgifts was almost equivalent to an acquaintance with both.</s> <s sid="4" id="arma.c26.s4">Add some little height and size to the figure of Pedgift Junior, give more breadth and boldness to his humor, and some additional solidity and composure to his confidence in himself, and the presence and character of Pedgift Senior stood, for all general purposes, revealed before you.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="arma.c35.p9"><s sid="37" id="arma.c35.s37">"His face altered when he heard who was below, and what it was I wanted of him; he looked not angry, but distressed.</s> <s sid="38" id="arma.c35.s38">He yielded, however, before long, not to my reasons, for I gave him none, but to my entreaties.</s> <s sid="39" id="arma.c35.s39">His old fondness for his friend might possibly have had some share in persuading him against his will; but my own opinion is that he acted entirely under the influence of his fondness for Me.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="arma.c35.p10"><s sid="40" id="arma.c35.s40">"I waited in the sitting-room while he went down to the door; so I knew nothing of what passed between them when they first saw each other again.</s> <s sid="41" id="arma.c35.s41">But oh, the difference between the two men when the interval had passed, and they came upstairs together and joined me.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="arma.c35.p11"><s sid="42" id="arma.c35.s42">"They were both agitated, but in such different ways!</s> <s sid="43" id="arma.c35.s43">The hateful Armadale, so loud and red and clumsy; the dear, lovable Midwinter, so pale and quiet, with such a gentleness in his voice when he spoke, and such tenderness in his eyes every time they turned my way.</s> <s sid="44" id="arma.c35.s44">Armadale overlooked me as completely as if I had not been in the room.</s> <s sid="45" id="arma.c35.s45">_He_ referred to me over and over again in the conversation; _he_ constantly looked at me to see what I thought, while I sat in my corner silently watching them; _he_ wanted to go with me and see me safe to my lodgings, and spare me all trouble with the cabman and the luggage.</s> <s sid="46" id="arma.c35.s46">When I thanked him and declined, Armadale looked unaffectedly relieved at the prospect of seeing my back turned, and of having his friend all to himself.</s> <s sid="47" id="arma.c35.s47">I left him, with his awkward elbows half over the table, scrawling a letter (no doubt to Miss Milroy), and shouting to the waiter that he wanted a bed at the hotel.</s> <s sid="48" id="arma.c35.s48">I had calculated on his staying, as a matter of course, where he found his friend staying.</s> <s sid="49" id="arma.c35.s49">It was pleasant to find my anticipations realized, and to know that I have as good as got him now under my own eye.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="arma.c35.p12"><s sid="50" id="arma.c35.s50">"After promising to let Midwinter know where he could see me to-morrow, I went away in the cab to hunt for lodgings by myself.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="arma.c35.p14"><s sid="57" id="arma.c35.s57">"July 29th.--Two o'clock.--Early in the morning I sent a line to Midwinter, telling him that he would find me here at three this afternoon.</s> <s sid="58" id="arma.c35.s58">That done, I devoted the morning to two errands of my own.</s> <s sid="59" id="arma.c35.s59">One is hardly worth mentioning--it was only to raise money on my watch and chain.</s> <s sid="60" id="arma.c35.s60">I got more than I expected; and more (even supposing I buy myself one or two little things in the way of cheap summer dress) than I am at all likely to spend before the wedding-day.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="arma.c38.p2"><s sid="2" id="arma.c38.s2">"We went to the San Carlo.</s> <s sid="3" id="arma.c38.s3">Armadale's stupidity showed itself, even in such a simple matter as taking a box.</s> <s sid="4" id="arma.c38.s4">He had confounded an opera with a play, and had chosen a box close to the stage, with the idea that one's chief object at a musical performance is to see the faces of the singers as plainly as possible!</s> <s sid="5" id="arma.c38.s5">Fortunately for our ears, Bellini's lovely melodies are, for the most part, tenderly and delicately accompanied--or the orchestra might have deafened us.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="arma.c38.p3"><s sid="6" id="arma.c38.s6">"I sat back in the box at first, well out of sight; for it was impossible to be sure that some of my old friends of former days at Naples might not be in the theater.</s> <s sid="7" id="arma.c38.s7">But the sweet music gradually tempted me out of my seclusion.</s> <s sid="8" id="arma.c38.s8">I was so charmed and interested that I leaned forward without knowing it, and looked at the stage.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="arma.c38.p4"><s sid="9" id="arma.c38.s9">"I was made aware of my own imprudence by a discovery which, for the moment, literally chilled my blood.</s> <s sid="10" id="arma.c38.s10">One of the singers, among the chorus of Druids, was looking at me while he sang with the rest.</s> <s sid="11" id="arma.c38.s11">His head was disguised in the long white hair, and the lower part of his face was completely covered with the flowing white beard proper to the character.</s> <s sid="12" id="arma.c38.s12">But the eyes with which he looked at me were the eyes of the one man on earth whom I have most reason to dread ever seeing again--Manuel!</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="arma.c38.p5"><s sid="13" id="arma.c38.s13">"If it had not been for my smelling-bottle, I believe I should have lost my senses.</s> <s sid="14" id="arma.c38.s14">As it was, I drew back again into the shadow.</s> <s sid="15" id="arma.c38.s15">Even Armadale noticed the sudden change in me: he, as well as Midwinter, asked if I was ill. I said I felt the heat, but hoped I should be better presently; and then leaned back in the box, and tried to rally my courage.</s> <s sid="16" id="arma.c38.s16">I succeeded in recovering self-possession enough to be able to look again at the stage (without showing myself) the next time the chorus appeared.</s> <s sid="17" id="arma.c38.s17">There was the man again!</s> <s sid="18" id="arma.c38.s18">But to my infinite relief he never looked toward our box a second time.</s> <s sid="19" id="arma.c38.s19">This welcome indifference, on his part, helped to satisfy me that I had seen an extraordinary accidental resemblance, and nothing more.</s> <s sid="20" id="arma.c38.s20">I still hold to this conclusion, after having had leisure to think; but my mind would be more completely at ease than it is if I had seen the rest of the man's face without the stage disguises that hid it from all investigation.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="arma.c38.p6"><s sid="21" id="arma.c38.s21">"When the curtain fell on the first act, there was a tiresome ballet to be performed (according to the absurd Italian custom), before the opera went on.</s> <s sid="22" id="arma.c38.s22">Though I had got over my first fright, I had been far too seriously startled to feel comfortable in the theater.</s> <s sid="23" id="arma.c38.s23">I dreaded all sorts of impossible accidents; and when Midwinter and Armadale put the question to me, I told them I was not well enough to stay through the rest of the performance.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="arma.c38.p7"><s sid="24" id="arma.c38.s24">"At the door of the theater Armadale proposed to say good-night.</s> <s sid="25" id="arma.c38.s25">But Midwinter--evidently dreading the evening with _me_--asked him to come back to supper, if I had no objection.</s> <s sid="26" id="arma.c38.s26">I said the necessary words, and we all three returned together to this house.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="arma.c38.p8"><s sid="27" id="arma.c38.s27">"Ten minutes' quiet in my own room (assisted by a little dose of eau-de-cologne and water) restored me to myself.</s> <s sid="28" id="arma.c38.s28">I joined the men at the supper-table.</s> <s sid="29" id="arma.c38.s29">They received my apologies for taking them away from the opera, with the complimentary assurance that I had not cost either of them the slightest sacrifice of his own pleasure.</s> <s sid="30" id="arma.c38.s30">Midwinter declared that he was too completely worn out to care for anything but the two great blessings, unattainable at the theater, of quiet and fresh air.</s> <s sid="31" id="arma.c38.s31">Armadale said--with an Englishman's exasperating pride in his own stupidity wherever a matter of art is concerned--that he couldn't make head or tail of the performance.</s> <s sid="32" id="arma.c38.s32">The principal disappointment, he was good enough to add, was mine, for I evidently understood foreign music, and enjoyed it.</s> <s sid="33" id="arma.c38.s33">Ladies generally did.</s> <s sid="34" id="arma.c38.s34">His darling little Neelie--</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="arma.c38.p9"><s sid="35" id="arma.c38.s35">"I was in no humor to be persecuted with his 'Darling Neelie' after what I had gone through at the theater.</s> <s sid="36" id="arma.c38.s36">It might have been the irritated state of my nerves, or it might have been the eau-de-cologne flying to my head, but the bare mention of the girl seemed to set me in a flame.</s> <s sid="37" id="arma.c38.s37">I tried to turn Armadale's attention in the direction of the supper-table.</s> <s sid="38" id="arma.c38.s38">He was much obliged, but he had no appetite for more.</s> <s sid="39" id="arma.c38.s39">I offered him wine next, the wine of the country, which is all that our poverty allows us to place on the table.</s> <s sid="40" id="arma.c38.s40">He was much obliged again.</s> <s sid="41" id="arma.c38.s41">The foreign wine was very little more to his taste than the foreign music; but he would take some because I asked him; and he would drink my health in the old-fashioned way, with his best wishes for the happy time when we should all meet again at Thorpe Ambrose, and when there would be a mistress to welcome me at the great house.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="arma.c38.p10"><s sid="42" id="arma.c38.s42">"Was he mad to persist in this way?</s> <s sid="43" id="arma.c38.s43">No; his face answered for him.</s> <s sid="44" id="arma.c38.s44">He was under the impression that he was making himself particularly agreeable to me.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="arma.c38.p11"><s sid="45" id="arma.c38.s45">"I looked at Midwinter.</s> <s sid="46" id="arma.c38.s46">He might have seen some reason for interfering to change the conversation, if he had looked at me in return.</s> <s sid="47" id="arma.c38.s47">But he sat silent in his chair, irritable and overworked, with his eyes on the ground, thinking.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="arma.c38.p12"><s sid="48" id="arma.c38.s48">"I got up and went to the window.</s> <s sid="49" id="arma.c38.s49">Still impenetrable to a sense of his own clumsiness, Armadale followed me.</s> <s sid="50" id="arma.c38.s50">If I had been strong enough to toss him out of the window into the sea, I should certainly have done it at that moment.</s> <s sid="51" id="arma.c38.s51">Not being strong enough, I looked steadily at the view over the bay, and gave him a hint, the broadest and rudest I could think of, to go.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="arma.c38.p13"><s sid="52" id="arma.c38.s52">"'A lovely night for a walk,' I said, <alt-qs/>'if you are tempted to walk back to the hotel.'<alt-qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="arma.c38.p15"><s sid="57" id="arma.c38.s57">"'With all your fondness for England,<alt-qs/>' I said, 'you must own that we have no such moonlight as that at home.'<alt-qe/></s> </p>

<stru>APPENDIX.








NOTE--My readers will perceive that I have purposely left them,


with reference to the Dream in this story, in the position which


they would occupy in the case of a dream in real life: they are


free to interpret it by the natural or the supernatural theory,


as the bent of their own minds may incline them. Persons disposed


to take the rational view may, under these circumstances, be


interested in hearing of a coincidence relating to the present


story, which actually happened, and which in the matter of


"extravagant improbability" sets anything of the same kind that


a novelist could imagine at flat defiance.





In November, 1865, that is to say, when thirteen monthly parts


of "Armadale" had been published, and, I may add, when more than


a year and a half had elapsed since the end of the story, as it


now appears, was first sketched in my notebook--a vessel lay in


the Huskisson Dock at Liverpool which was looked after by one man,


who slept on board, in the capacity of shipkeeper. On a certain


day in the week this man was found dead in the deck-house. On the


next day a second man, who had taken his place, was carried dying


to the Northern Hospital. On the third day a third ship-keeper


was appointed, and was found dead in the deck-house which had


already proved fatal to the other two. _The name of that ship was


"The Armadale."_ And the proceedings at the Inquest proved that


the three men had been all suffocated _by sleeping in poisoned


air_!





I am indebted for these particulars to the kindness of the


reporters at Liverpool, who sent me their statement of the facts.


The case found its way into most of the newspapers. It was


noticed--to give two instances in which I can cite the dates--in


the _Times_ of November 30th, 1865, and was more fully described


in the _Daily News_ of November 28th, in the same year.





Before taking leave of "Armadale," I may perhaps be allowed


to mention, for the benefit of any readers who may be curious


on such points, that the "Norfolk Broads" are here described


after personal investigation of them. In this, as in other cases,


I have spared no pains to instruct myself on matters of fact.


Wherever the story touches on questions connected with Law,


Medicine, or Chemistry, it has been submitted before publication


to the experience of professional men. The kindness of a friend


supplied me with a plan of the doctor's apparatus, and I saw


the chemical ingredients at work before I ventured on describing


the action of them in the closing scenes of this book.</stru>
