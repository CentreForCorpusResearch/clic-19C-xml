<p pid="1" id="LadyAud.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="LadyAud.c1.s1">LUCY.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="LadyAud.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="LadyAud.c1.s2">It lay down in a hollow, rich with fine old timber and luxuriant pastures; and you came upon it through an avenue of limes, bordered on either side by meadows, over the high hedges of which the cattle looked inquisitively at you as you passed, wondering, perhaps, what you wanted; for there was no thorough-fare, and unless you were going to the Court you had no business there at all.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="LadyAud.c1.p3"><s sid="3" id="LadyAud.c1.s3">At the end of this avenue there was an old arch and a clock tower, with a stupid, bewildering clock, which had only one hand--and which jumped straight from one hour to the next--and was therefore always in extremes.</s> <s sid="4" id="LadyAud.c1.s4">Through this arch you walked straight into the gardens of Audley Court.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="LadyAud.c1.p4"><s sid="5" id="LadyAud.c1.s5">A smooth lawn lay before you, dotted with groups of rhododendrons, which grew in more perfection here than anywhere else in the county.</s> <s sid="6" id="LadyAud.c1.s6">To the right there were the kitchen gardens, the fish-pond, and an orchard bordered by a dry moat, and a broken ruin of a wall, in some places thicker than it was high, and everywhere overgrown with trailing ivy, yellow stonecrop, and dark moss.</s> <s sid="7" id="LadyAud.c1.s7">To the left there was a broad graveled walk, down which, years ago, when the place had been a convent, the quiet nuns had walked hand in hand; a wall bordered with espaliers, and shadowed on one side by goodly oaks, which shut out the flat landscape, and circled in the house and gardens with a darkening shelter.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="LadyAud.c1.p5"><s sid="8" id="LadyAud.c1.s8">The house faced the arch, and occupied three sides of a quadrangle.</s> <s sid="9" id="LadyAud.c1.s9">It was very old, and very irregular and rambling.</s> <s sid="10" id="LadyAud.c1.s10">The windows were uneven; some small, some large, some with heavy stone mullions and rich stained glass; others with frail lattices that rattled in every breeze; others so modern that they might have been added only yesterday.</s> <s sid="11" id="LadyAud.c1.s11">Great piles of chimneys rose up here and there behind the pointed gables, and seemed as if they were so broken down by age and long service that they must have fallen but for the straggling ivy which, crawling up the walls and trailing even over the roof, wound itself about them and supported them.</s> <s sid="12" id="LadyAud.c1.s12">The principal door was squeezed into a corner of a turret at one angle of the building, as if it were in hiding from dangerous visitors, and wished to keep itself a secret--a noble door for all that--old oak, and studded with great square-headed iron nails, and so thick that the sharp iron knocker struck upon it with a muffled sound, and the visitor rung a clanging bell that dangled in a corner among the ivy, lest the noise of the knocking should never penetrate the stronghold.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="LadyAud.c1.p6"><s sid="13" id="LadyAud.c1.s13">A glorious old place.</s> <s sid="14" id="LadyAud.c1.s14">A place that visitors fell in raptures with; feeling a yearning wish to have done with life, and to stay there forever, staring into the cool fish-ponds and counting the bubbles as the roach and carp rose to the surface of the water.</s> <s sid="15" id="LadyAud.c1.s15">A spot in which peace seemed to have taken up her abode, setting her soothing hand on every tree and flower, on the still ponds and quiet alleys, the shady corners of the old-fashioned rooms, the deep window-seats behind the painted glass, the low meadows and the stately avenues--ay, even upon the stagnant well, which, cool and sheltered as all else in the old place, hid itself away in a shrubbery behind the gardens, with an idle handle that was never turned and a lazy rope so rotten that the pail had broken away from it, and had fallen into the water.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="LadyAud.c1.p7"><s sid="16" id="LadyAud.c1.s16">A noble place; inside as well as out, a noble place--a house in which you incontinently lost yourself if ever you were so rash as to attempt to penetrate its mysteries alone; a house in which no one room had any sympathy with another, every chamber running off at a tangent into an inner chamber, and through that down some narrow staircase leading to a door which, in its turn, led back into that very part of the house from which you thought yourself the furthest; a house that could never have been planned by any mortal architect, but must have been the handiwork of that good old builder, Time, who, adding a room one year, and knocking down a room another year, toppling down a chimney coeval with the Plantagenets, and setting up one in the style of the Tudors; shaking down a bit of Saxon wall, allowing a Norman arch to stand here; throwing in a row of high narrow windows in the reign of Queen Anne, and joining on a dining-room after the fashion of the time of Hanoverian George I, to a refectory that had been standing since the Conquest, had contrived, in some eleven centuries, to run up such a mansion as was not elsewhere to be met with throughout the county of Essex.</s> <s sid="17" id="LadyAud.c1.s17">Of course, in such a house there were secret chambers; the little daughter of the present owner, Sir Michael Audley, had fallen by accident upon the discovery of one.</s> <s sid="18" id="LadyAud.c1.s18">A board had rattled under her feet in the great nursery where she played, and on attention being drawn to it, it was found to be loose, and so removed, revealed a ladder, leading to a hiding-place between the floor of the nursery and the ceiling of the room below--a hiding-place so small that he who had hid there must have crouched on his hands and knees or lain at full length, and yet large enough to contain a quaint old carved oak chest, half filled with priests' vestments, which had been hidden away, no doubt, in those cruel days when the life of a man was in danger if he was discovered to have harbored a Roman Catholic priest, or to have mass said in his house.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="LadyAud.c1.p8"><s sid="19" id="LadyAud.c1.s19">The broad outer moat was dry and grass-grown, and the laden trees of the orchard hung over it with gnarled, straggling branches that drew fantastical shadows upon the green slope.</s> <s sid="20" id="LadyAud.c1.s20">Within this moat there was, as I have said, the fish-pond--a sheet of water that extended the whole length of the garden and bordering which there was an avenue called the lime-tree walk; an avenue so shaded from the sun and sky, so screened from observation by the thick shelter of the over-arching trees that it seemed a chosen place for secret meetings or for stolen interviews; a place in which a conspiracy might have been planned, or a lover's vow registered with equal safety; and yet it was scarcely twenty paces from the house.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="LadyAud.c1.p9"><s sid="21" id="LadyAud.c1.s21">At the end of this dark arcade there was the shrubbery, where, half buried among the tangled branches and the neglected weeds, stood the rusty wheel of that old well of which I have spoken.</s> <s sid="22" id="LadyAud.c1.s22">It had been of good service in its time, no doubt; and busy nuns have perhaps drawn the cool water with their own fair hands; but it had fallen into disuse now, and scarcely any one at Audley Court knew whether the spring had dried up or not.</s> <s sid="23" id="LadyAud.c1.s23">But sheltered as was the solitude of this lime-tree walk, I doubt very much if it was ever put to any romantic uses.</s> <s sid="24" id="LadyAud.c1.s24">Often in the cool of the evening Sir Michael Audley would stroll up and down smoking his cigar, with his dogs at his heels, and his pretty young wife dawdling by his side; but in about ten minutes the baronet and his companion would grow tired of the rustling limes and the still water, hidden under the spreading leaves of the water-lilies, and the long green vista with the broken well at the end, and would stroll back to the drawing-room, where my lady played dreamy melodies by Beethoven and Mendelssohn till her husband fell asleep in his easy-chair.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="LadyAud.c1.p10"><s sid="25" id="LadyAud.c1.s25">Sir Michael Audley was fifty-six years of age, and he had married a second wife three months after his fifty-fifth birthday.</s> <s sid="26" id="LadyAud.c1.s26">He was a big man, tall and stout, with a deep, sonorous voice, handsome black eyes, and a white beard--a white beard which made him look venerable against his will, for he was as active as a boy, and one of the hardest riders in the country.</s> <s sid="27" id="LadyAud.c1.s27">For seventeen years he had been a widower with an only child, a daughter, Alicia Audley, now eighteen, and by no means too well pleased at having a step-mother brought home to the Court; for Miss Alicia had reigned supreme in her father's house since her earliest childhood, and had carried the keys, and jingled them in the pockets of her silk aprons, and lost them in the shrubbery, and dropped them into the pond, and given all manner of trouble about them from the hour in which she entered her teens, and had, on that account, deluded herself into the sincere belief, that for the whole of that period, she had been keeping the house.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="LadyAud.c1.p11"><s sid="28" id="LadyAud.c1.s28">But Miss Alicia's day was over; and now, when she asked anything of the housekeeper, the housekeeper would tell her that she would speak to my lady, or she would consult my lady, and if my lady pleased it should be done.</s> <s sid="29" id="LadyAud.c1.s29">So the baronet's daughter, who was an excellent horsewoman and a very clever artist, spent most of her time out of doors, riding about the green lanes, and sketching the cottage children, and the plow-boys, and the cattle, and all manner of animal life that came in her way.</s> <s sid="30" id="LadyAud.c1.s30">She set her face with a sulky determination against any intimacy between herself and the baronet's young wife; and amiable as that lady was, she found it quite impossible to overcome Miss Alicia's prejudices and dislike; or to convince the spoilt girl that she had not done her a cruel injury by marrying Sir Michael Audley.</s> <s sid="31" id="LadyAud.c1.s31">The truth was that Lady Audley had, in becoming the wife of Sir Michael, made one of those apparently advantageous matches which are apt to draw upon a woman the envy and hatred of her sex.</s> <s sid="32" id="LadyAud.c1.s32">She had come into the neighborhood as a governess in the family of a surgeon in the village near Audley Court.</s> <s sid="33" id="LadyAud.c1.s33">No one knew anything of her, except that she came in answer to an advertisement which Mr. Dawson, the surgeon, had inserted in The _Times_.</s> <s sid="34" id="LadyAud.c1.s34">She came from London; and the only reference she gave was to a lady at a school at Brompton, where she had once been a teacher.</s> <s sid="35" id="LadyAud.c1.s35">But this reference was so satisfactory that none other was needed, and Miss Lucy Graham was received by the surgeon as the instructress of his daughters.</s> <s sid="36" id="LadyAud.c1.s36">Her accomplishments were so brilliant and numerous, that it seemed strange that she should have answered an advertisement offering such very moderate terms of remuneration as those named by Mr. Dawson; but Miss Graham seemed perfectly well satisfied with her situation, and she taught the girls to play sonatas by Beethoven, and to paint from nature after Creswick, and walked through a dull, out-of-the-way village to the humble little church, three times every Sunday, as contentedly as if she had no higher aspiration in the world than to do so all the rest of her life.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="LadyAud.c1.p12"><s sid="37" id="LadyAud.c1.s37">People who observed this, accounted for it by saying that it was a part of her amiable and gentle nature always to be light-hearted, happy and contented under any circumstances.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="LadyAud.c1.p13"><s sid="38" id="LadyAud.c1.s38">Wherever she went she seemed to take joy and brightness with her.</s> <s sid="39" id="LadyAud.c1.s39">In the cottages of the poor her fair face shone like a sunbeam.</s> <s sid="40" id="LadyAud.c1.s40">She would sit for a quarter of an hour talking to some old woman, and apparently as pleased with the admiration of a toothless crone as if she had been listening to the compliments of a marquis; and when she tripped away, leaving nothing behind her (for her poor salary gave no scope to her benevolence), the old woman would burst out into senile raptures with her grace, beauty, and her kindliness, such as she never bestowed upon the vicar's wife, who half fed and clothed her.</s> <s sid="41" id="LadyAud.c1.s41">For you see, Miss Lucy Graham was blessed with that magic power of fascination, by which a woman can charm with a word or intoxicate with a smile.</s> <s sid="42" id="LadyAud.c1.s42">Every one loved, admired, and praised her.</s> <s sid="43" id="LadyAud.c1.s43">The boy who opened the five-barred gate that stood in her pathway, ran home to his mother to tell of her pretty looks, and the sweet voice in which she thanked him for the little service.</s> <s sid="44" id="LadyAud.c1.s44">The verger at the church, who ushered her into the surgeon's pew; the vicar, who saw the soft blue eyes uplifted to his face as he preached his simple sermon; the porter from the railway station, who brought her sometimes a letter or a parcel, and who never looked for reward from her; her employer; his visitors; her pupils; the servants; everybody, high and low, united in declaring that Lucy Graham was the sweetest girl that ever lived.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="LadyAud.c1.p14"><s sid="45" id="LadyAud.c1.s45">Perhaps it was the rumor of this which penetrated into the quiet chamber of Audley Court; or, perhaps, it was the sight of her pretty face, looking over the surgeon's high pew every Sunday morning; however it was, it was certain that Sir Michael Audley suddenly experienced a strong desire to be better acquainted with Mr. Dawson's governess.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="LadyAud.c1.p15"><s sid="46" id="LadyAud.c1.s46">He had only to hint his wish to the worthy doctor for a little party to be got up, to which the vicar and his wife, and the baronet and his daughter, were invited.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="LadyAud.c1.p16"><s sid="47" id="LadyAud.c1.s47">That one quiet evening sealed Sir Michael's fate.</s> <s sid="48" id="LadyAud.c1.s48">He could no more resist the tender fascination of those soft and melting blue eyes; the graceful beauty of that slender throat and drooping head, with its wealth of showering flaxen curls; the low music of that gentle voice; the perfect harmony which pervaded every charm, and made all doubly charming in this woman; than he could resist his destiny!</s> <s sid="49" id="LadyAud.c1.s49">Destiny!</s> <s sid="50" id="LadyAud.c1.s50">Why, she was his destiny!</s> <s sid="51" id="LadyAud.c1.s51">He had never loved before.</s> <s sid="52" id="LadyAud.c1.s52">What had been his marriage with Alicia's mother but a dull, jog-trot bargain made to keep some estate in the family that would have been just as well out of it?</s> <s sid="53" id="LadyAud.c1.s53">What had been his love for his first wife but a poor, pitiful, smoldering spark, too dull to be extinguished, too feeble to burn?</s> <s sid="54" id="LadyAud.c1.s54">But _this_ was love--this fever, this longing, this restless, uncertain, miserable hesitation; these cruel fears that his age was an insurmountable barrier to his happiness; this sick hatred of his white beard; this frenzied wish to be young again, with glistening raven hair, and a slim waist, such as he had twenty years before; these, wakeful nights and melancholy days, so gloriously brightened if he chanced to catch a glimpse of her sweet face behind the window curtains, as he drove past the surgeon's house; all these signs gave token of the truth, and told only too plainly that, at the sober age of fifty-five, Sir Michael Audley had fallen ill of the terrible fever called love.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="LadyAud.c1.p17"><s sid="55" id="LadyAud.c1.s55">I do not think that, throughout his courtship, the baronet once calculated upon his wealth or his position as reasons for his success.</s> <s sid="56" id="LadyAud.c1.s56">If he ever remembered these things, he dismissed the thought of them with a shudder.</s> <s sid="57" id="LadyAud.c1.s57">It pained him too much to believe for a moment that any one so lovely and innocent could value herself against a splendid house or a good old title.</s> <s sid="58" id="LadyAud.c1.s58">No; his hope was that, as her life had been most likely one of toil and dependence, and as she was very young nobody exactly knew her age, but she looked little more than twenty, she might never have formed any attachment, and that he, being the first to woo her, might, by tender attentions, by generous watchfulness, by a love which should recall to her the father she had lost, and by a protecting care that should make him necessary to her, win her young heart, and obtain from her fresh and earliest love, the promise or her hand.</s> <s sid="59" id="LadyAud.c1.s59">It was a very romantic day-dream, no doubt; but, for all that, it seemed in a very fair way to be realized.</s> <s sid="60" id="LadyAud.c1.s60">Lucy Graham appeared by no means to dislike the baronet's attentions.</s> <s sid="61" id="LadyAud.c1.s61">There was nothing whatever in her manner that betrayed the shallow artifices employed by a woman who wishes to captivate a rich man.</s> <s sid="62" id="LadyAud.c1.s62">She was so accustomed to admiration from every one, high and low, that Sir Michael's conduct made very little impression upon her.</s> <s sid="63" id="LadyAud.c1.s63">Again, he had been so many years a widower that people had given up the idea of his ever marrying again.</s> <s sid="64" id="LadyAud.c1.s64">At last, however, Mrs. Dawson spoke to the governess on the subject.</s> <s sid="65" id="LadyAud.c1.s65">The surgeon's wife was sitting in the school-room busy at work, while Lucy was putting the finishing touches on some water-color sketches done by her pupils.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="LadyAud.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="LadyAud.c1.s66"><qs/>"Do you know, my dear Miss Graham,"<qe/><sss/> said Mrs. Dawson, <sse/><qs/>"I think you ought to consider yourself a remarkably lucky girl?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="LadyAud.c1.p19"><s sid="67" id="LadyAud.c1.s67">The governess lifted her head from its stooping attitude, and stared wonderingly at her employer, shaking back a shower of curls.</s> <s sid="68" id="LadyAud.c1.s68">They were the most wonderful curls in the world--soft and feathery, always floating away from her face, and making a pale halo round her head when the sunlight shone through them.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="LadyAud.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="LadyAud.c1.s69"><qs/>"What do you mean, my dear Mrs. Dawson?"<qe/> she asked, dipping her camel's-hair brush into the wet aquamarine upon the palette, and poising it carefully before putting in the delicate streak of purple which was to brighten the horizon in her pupil's sketch.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="LadyAud.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="LadyAud.c1.s70"><qs/>"Why, I mean, my dear, that it only rests with yourself to become Lady Audley, and the mistress of Audley Court."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="LadyAud.c1.p22"><s sid="71" id="LadyAud.c1.s71">Lucy Graham dropped the brush upon the picture, and flushed scarlet to the roots of her fair hair; and then grew pale again, far paler than Mrs. Dawson had ever seen her before.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="LadyAud.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="LadyAud.c1.s72"><qs/>"My dear, don't agitate yourself,"<qe/><sls/> said the surgeon's wife, soothingly; <sle/><qs/>"you know that nobody asks you to marry Sir Michael unless you wish.</s> <s sid="73" id="LadyAud.c1.s73">Of course it would be a magnificent match; he has a splendid income, and is one of the most generous of men.</s> <s sid="74" id="LadyAud.c1.s74">Your position would be very high, and you would be enabled to do a great deal of good; but, as I said before, you must be entirely guided by your own feelings.</s> <s sid="75" id="LadyAud.c1.s75">Only one thing I must say, and that is that if Sir Michael's attentions are not agreeable to you, it is really scarcely honorable to encourage him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="LadyAud.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="LadyAud.c1.s76"><qs/>"His attentions--encourage him!"<qe/> muttered Lucy, as if the words bewildered her.</s> <s sid="77" id="LadyAud.c1.s77"><qs/>"Pray, pray don't talk to me, Mrs. Dawson.</s> <s sid="78" id="LadyAud.c1.s78">I had no idea of this.</s> <s sid="79" id="LadyAud.c1.s79">It is the last thing that would have occurred to me."<qe/></s> <s sid="80" id="LadyAud.c1.s80">She leaned her elbows on the drawing-board before her, and clasping her hands over her face, seemed for some minutes to be thinking deeply.</s> <s sid="81" id="LadyAud.c1.s81">She wore a narrow black ribbon round her neck, with a locket, or a cross, or a miniature, perhaps, attached to it; but whatever the trinket was, she always kept it hidden under her dress.</s> <s sid="82" id="LadyAud.c1.s82">Once or twice, while she sat silently thinking, she removed one of her hands from before her face, and fidgeted nervously with the ribbon, clutching at it with a half-angry gesture, and twisting it backward and forward between her fingers.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="LadyAud.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="LadyAud.c1.s83"><qs/>"I think some people are born to be unlucky, Mrs. Dawson,"<qe/><sss/> she said, by-and-by; <sse/><qs/>"it would be a great deal too much good fortune for me to become Lady Audley."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="LadyAud.c1.p26"><s sid="84" id="LadyAud.c1.s84">She said this with so much bitterness in her tone, that the surgeon's wife looked up at her with surprise.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="LadyAud.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="LadyAud.c1.s85"><qs/>"You unlucky, my dear!"<qe/> she exclaimed.</s> <s sid="86" id="LadyAud.c1.s86"><qs/>"I think you are the last person who ought to talk like that--you, such a bright, happy creature, that it does every one good to see you.</s> <s sid="87" id="LadyAud.c1.s87">I'm sure I don't know what we shall do if Sir Michael robs us of you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="LadyAud.c1.p28"><s sid="88" id="LadyAud.c1.s88">After this conversation they often spoke upon the subject, and Lucy never again showed any emotion whatever when the baronet's admiration for her was canvassed.</s> <s sid="89" id="LadyAud.c1.s89">It was a tacitly understood thing in the surgeon's family that whenever Sir Michael proposed, the governess would quietly accept him; and, indeed, the simple Dawsons would have thought it something more than madness in a penniless girl to reject such an offer.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="LadyAud.c1.p29"><s sid="90" id="LadyAud.c1.s90">So, one misty August evening, Sir Michael, sitting opposite to Lucy Graham, at a window in the surgeon's little drawing-room, took an opportunity while the family happened by some accident to be absent from the room, of speaking upon the subject nearest to his heart.</s> <s sid="91" id="LadyAud.c1.s91">He made the governess, in a few but solemn words, an offer of his hand.</s> <s sid="92" id="LadyAud.c1.s92">There was something almost touching in the manner and tone in which he spoke to her--half in deprecation, knowing that he could hardly expect to be the choice of a beautiful young girl, and praying rather that she would reject him, even though she broke his heart by doing so, than that she should accept his offer if she did not love him.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="LadyAud.c1.p30" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="LadyAud.c1.s93"><qs/>"I scarcely think there is a greater sin, Lucy,"<qe/><sss/> he said, solemnly, <sse/><qs/>"than that of a woman who marries a man she does not love.</s> <s sid="94" id="LadyAud.c1.s94">You are so precious to me, my beloved, that deeply as my heart is set on this, and bitter as the mere thought of disappointment is to me, I would not have you commit such a sin for any happiness of mine.</s> <s sid="95" id="LadyAud.c1.s95">If my happiness could be achieved by such an act, which it could not--which it never could,"<qe/><sss/> he repeated, earnestly--<sse/><qs/>"nothing but misery can result from a marriage dictated by any motive but truth and love."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="LadyAud.c1.p31"><s sid="96" id="LadyAud.c1.s96">Lucy Graham was not looking at Sir Michael, but straight out into the misty twilight and dim landscape far away beyond the little garden.</s> <s sid="97" id="LadyAud.c1.s97">The baronet tried to see her face, but her profile was turned to him, and he could not discover the expression of her eyes.</s> <s sid="98" id="LadyAud.c1.s98">If he could have done so, he would have seen a yearning gaze which seemed as if it would have pierced the far obscurity and looked away--away into another world.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="LadyAud.c1.p32" type="speech"><s sid="99" id="LadyAud.c1.s99"><qs/>"Lucy, you heard me?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="LadyAud.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="100" id="LadyAud.c1.s100"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/> she said, gravely; not coldly, or in any way as if she were offended at his words.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="LadyAud.c1.p34" type="speech"><s sid="101" id="LadyAud.c1.s101"><qs/>"And your answer?"<qe/></s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER IV. IN THE FIRST PAGE OF "THE TIMES."</title>

<p pid="1" id="LadyAud.c4.p1"><s sid="1" id="LadyAud.c4.s1">Robert Audley was supposed to be a barrister.</s> <s sid="2" id="LadyAud.c4.s2">As a barrister was his name inscribed in the law-list; as a barrister he had chambers in Figtree Court, Temple; as a barrister he had eaten the allotted number of dinners, which form the sublime ordeal through which the forensic aspirant wades on to fame and fortune.</s> <s sid="3" id="LadyAud.c4.s3">If these things can make a man a barrister, Robert Audley decidedly was one.</s> <s sid="4" id="LadyAud.c4.s4">But he had never either had a brief, or tried to get a brief, or even wished to have a brief in all those five years, during which his name had been painted upon one of the doors in Figtree Court.</s> <s sid="5" id="LadyAud.c4.s5">He was a handsome, lazy, care-for-nothing fellow, of about seven-and-twenty; the only son of a younger brother of Sir Michael Audley.</s> <s sid="6" id="LadyAud.c4.s6">His father had left him L400 a year, which his friends had advised him to increase by being called to the bar; and as he found it, after due consideration, more trouble to oppose the wishes of these friends than to eat so many dinners, and to take a set of chambers in the Temple, he adopted the latter course, and unblushingly called himself a barrister.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="LadyAud.c4.p2"><s sid="7" id="LadyAud.c4.s7">Sometimes, when the weather was very hot, and he had exhausted himself with the exertion of smoking his German pipe, and reading French novels, he would stroll into the Temple Gardens, and lying in some shady spot, pale and cool, with his shirt collar turned down and a blue silk handkerchief tied loosely about his neck, would tell grave benchers that he had knocked himself up with over work.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="LadyAud.c4.p3"><s sid="8" id="LadyAud.c4.s8">The sly old benchers laughed at the pleasant fiction; but they all agreed that Robert Audley was a good fellow; a generous-hearted fellow; rather a curious fellow, too, with a fund of sly wit and quiet humor, under his listless, dawdling, indifferent, irresolute manner.</s> <s sid="9" id="LadyAud.c4.s9">A man who would never get on in the world; but who would not hurt a worm.</s> <s sid="10" id="LadyAud.c4.s10">Indeed, his chambers were converted into a perfect dog-kennel, by his habit of bringing home stray and benighted curs, who were attracted by his looks in the street, and followed him with abject fondness.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="LadyAud.c4.p4"><s sid="11" id="LadyAud.c4.s11">Robert always spent the hunting season at Audley Court; not that he was distinguished as a Nimrod, for he would quietly trot to covert upon a mild-tempered, stout-limbed bay hack, and keep at a very respectful distance from the hard riders; his horse knowing quite as well as he did, that nothing was further from his thoughts than any desire to be in at the death.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="LadyAud.c4.p5"><s sid="12" id="LadyAud.c4.s12">The young man was a great favorite with his uncle, and by no means despised by his pretty, gipsy-faced, light-hearted, hoydenish cousin, Miss Alice Audley.</s> <s sid="13" id="LadyAud.c4.s13">It might have seemed to other men, that the partiality of a young lady who was sole heiress to a very fine estate, was rather well worth cultivating, but it did not so occur to Robert Audley.</s> <s sid="14" id="LadyAud.c4.s14">Alicia was a very nice girl, he said, a jolly girl, with no nonsense about her--a girl of a thousand; but this was the highest point to which enthusiasm could carry him.</s> <s sid="15" id="LadyAud.c4.s15">The idea of turning his cousin's girlish liking for him to some good account never entered his idle brain.</s> <s sid="16" id="LadyAud.c4.s16">I doubt if he even had any correct notion of the amount of his uncle's fortune, and I am certain that he never for one moment calculated upon the chances of any part of that fortune ultimately coming to himself.</s> <s sid="17" id="LadyAud.c4.s17">So that when, one fine spring morning, about three months before the time of which I am writing, the postman brought him the wedding cards of Sir Michael and Lady Audley, together with a very indignant letter from his cousin, setting forth how her father had just married a wax-dollish young person, no older than Alicia herself, with flaxen ringlets, and a perpetual giggle; for I am sorry to say that Miss Audley's animus caused her thus to describe that pretty musical laugh which had been so much admired in the late Miss Lucy Graham--when, I say, these documents reached Robert Audley--they elicited neither vexation nor astonishment in the lymphatic nature of that gentleman.</s> <s sid="18" id="LadyAud.c4.s18">He read Alicia's angry crossed and recrossed letter without so much as removing the amber mouth-piece of his German pipe from his mustached lips.</s> <s sid="19" id="LadyAud.c4.s19">When he had finished the perusal of the epistle, which he read with his dark eyebrows elevated to the center of his forehead (his only manner of expressing surprise, by the way) he deliberately threw that and the wedding cards into the waste-paper basket, and putting down his pipe, prepared himself for the exertion of thinking out the subject.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="LadyAud.c4.p6" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="LadyAud.c4.s20"><qs/>"I always said the old buffer would marry,"<qe/> he muttered, after about half an hour's revery.</s> <s sid="21" id="LadyAud.c4.s21">Alicia and my lady, the stepmother, will go at it hammer and tongs.</s> <s sid="22" id="LadyAud.c4.s22">I hope they won't quarrel in the hunting season, or say unpleasant things to each other at the dinner-table; rows always upset a man's digestion.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="LadyAud.c4.p7"><s sid="23" id="LadyAud.c4.s23">At about twelve o'clock on the morning following that night upon which the events recorded in my last chapter had taken place, the baronet's nephew strolled out of the Temple, Blackfriarsward, on his way to the city.</s> <s sid="24" id="LadyAud.c4.s24">He had in an evil hour obliged some necessitous friend by putting the ancient name of Audley across a bill of accommodation, which bill not having been provided for by the drawer, Robert was called upon to pay.</s> <s sid="25" id="LadyAud.c4.s25">For this purpose he sauntered up Ludgate Hill, with his blue necktie fluttering in the hot August air, and thence to a refreshingly cool banking-house in a shady court out of St.</s> <s sid="26" id="LadyAud.c4.s26">Paul's churchyard, where be made arrangements for selling out a couple of hundred pounds' worth of consols.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="LadyAud.c4.p8"><s sid="27" id="LadyAud.c4.s27">He had transacted this business, and was loitering at the corner of the court, waiting for a chance hansom to convey him back to the Temple, when he was almost knocked down by a man of about his own age, who dashed headlong into the narrow opening.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="LadyAud.c4.p15"><s sid="36" id="LadyAud.c4.s36">George Talboys did tell him all about it.</s> <s sid="37" id="LadyAud.c4.s37">He told that very story which he had related ten days before to the pale governess on board the _Argus_; and then, hot and breathless, he said that he had twenty thousand pounds or so in his pocket, and that he wanted to bank it at Messrs.</s> <s sid="38" id="LadyAud.c4.s38">----, who had been his bankers many years before.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="LadyAud.c8.p3"><s sid="3" id="LadyAud.c8.s3">I am afraid, if the real truth is to be told, there was, perhaps, something of affectation in the anxiety this young lady expressed to make George's acquaintance; but if poor Alicia for a moment calculated upon arousing any latent spark of jealousy lurking in her cousin's breast by this exhibition of interest, she was not so well acquainted with Robert Audley's disposition as she might have been.</s> <s sid="4" id="LadyAud.c8.s4">Indolent, handsome, and indifferent, the young barrister took life as altogether too absurd a mistake for any one event in its foolish course to be for a moment considered seriously by a sensible man.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="LadyAud.c8.p5"><s sid="7" id="LadyAud.c8.s7">Again, had he been in love with her himself, I fancy that the tender passion would, with him, have been so vague and feeble a sentiment that he might have gone down to his grave with a dim sense of some uneasy sensation which might be love or indigestion, and with, beyond this, no knowledge whatever of his state.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="LadyAud.c8.p6"><s sid="8" id="LadyAud.c8.s8">So it was not the least use, my poor Alicia, to ride about the lanes around Audley during those three days which the two young men spent in Essex; it was wasted trouble to wear that pretty cavalier hat and plume, and to be always, by the most singular of chances, meeting Robert and his friend.</s> <s sid="9" id="LadyAud.c8.s9">The black curls (nothing like Lady Audley's feathery ringlets, but heavy clustering locks, that clung about your slender brown throat), the red and pouting lips, the nose inclined to be _retrousse_, the dark complexion, with its bright crimson flush, always ready to glance up like a signal light in a dusky sky, when you came suddenly upon your apathetic cousin--all this coquettish _espiegle_, brunette beauty was thrown away upon the dull eyes of Robert Audley, and you might as well have taken your rest in the cool drawing-room at the Court, instead of working your pretty mare to death under the hot September sun.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="LadyAud.c13.p2"><s sid="2" id="LadyAud.c13.s2">Robert Audley left Southampton by the mail, and let himself into his chambers just as the dawn was creeping cold and gray into the solitary rooms, and the canaries were beginning to rustle their feathers feebly in the early morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="LadyAud.c13.p3"><s sid="3" id="LadyAud.c13.s3">There were several letters in the box behind the door, but there was none from George Talboys.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="LadyAud.c13.p4"><s sid="4" id="LadyAud.c13.s4">The young barrister was worn out by a long day spent in hurrying from place to place.</s> <s sid="5" id="LadyAud.c13.s5">The usual lazy monotony of his life had been broken as it had never been broken before in eight-and-twenty tranquil, easy-going years.</s> <s sid="6" id="LadyAud.c13.s6">His mind was beginning to grow confused upon the point of time.</s> <s sid="7" id="LadyAud.c13.s7">It seemed to him months since he had lost sight of George Talboys.</s> <s sid="8" id="LadyAud.c13.s8">It was so difficult to believe that it was less than forty-eight hours ago that the young man had left him asleep under the willows by the trout stream.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="LadyAud.c13.p5"><s sid="9" id="LadyAud.c13.s9">His eyes were painfully weary for want of sleep.</s> <s sid="10" id="LadyAud.c13.s10">He searched about the room for some time, looking in all sorts of impossible places for a letter from George Talboys, and then threw himself dressed upon his friend's bed, in the room with the canaries and geraniums.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="LadyAud.c13.p7"><s sid="12" id="LadyAud.c13.s12">He was thoroughly exhausted, and fell into a heavy sleep--a sleep which was profound without being in any way refreshing, for he was tormented all the time by disagreeable dreams--dreams which were painful, not from any horror in themselves, but from a vague and wearying sense of their confusion and absurdity.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="LadyAud.c13.p8"><s sid="13" id="LadyAud.c13.s13">At one time he was pursuing strange people and entering strange houses in the endeavor to unravel the mystery of the telegraphic dispatch; at another time he was in the church-yard at Ventnor, gazing at the headstone George had ordered for the grave of his dead wife.</s> <s sid="14" id="LadyAud.c13.s14">Once in the long, rambling mystery of these dreams he went to the grave, and found this headstone gone, and on remonstrating with the stonemason, was told that the man had a reason for removing the inscription; a reason that Robert would some day learn.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="LadyAud.c13.p9"><s sid="15" id="LadyAud.c13.s15">In another dream he saw the grave of Helen Talboys open, and while he waited, with the cold horror lifting up his hair, to see the dead woman rise and stand before him with her stiff, charnel-house drapery clinging about her rigid limbs, his uncle's wife tripped gaily put of the open grave, dressed in the crimson velvet robes in which the artist had painted her, and with her ringlets flashing like red gold in the unearthly light that shone about her.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="LadyAud.c13.p10"><s sid="16" id="LadyAud.c13.s16">But into all these dreams the places he had last been in, and the people with whom he had last been concerned, were dimly interwoven--sometimes his uncle; sometimes Alicia; oftenest of all my lady; the trout stream in Essex; the lime-walk at the Court.</s> <s sid="17" id="LadyAud.c13.s17">Once he was walking in the black shadows of this long avenue, with Lady Audley hanging on his arm, when suddenly they heard a great knocking in the distance, and his uncle's wife wound her slender arms around him, crying out that it was the day of judgment, and that all wicked secrets must now be told.</s> <s sid="18" id="LadyAud.c13.s18">Looking at her as she shrieked this in his ear, he saw that her face had grown ghastly white, and that her beautiful golden ringlets were changing into serpents, and slowly creeping down her fair neck.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="LadyAud.c13.p11"><s sid="19" id="LadyAud.c13.s19">He started from his dream to find that there was some one really knocking at the outer door of his chambers.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="LadyAud.c13.p12"><s sid="20" id="LadyAud.c13.s20">It was a dreary, wet morning, the rain beating against the windows, and the canaries twittering dismally to each other--complaining, perhaps, of the bad weather.</s> <s sid="21" id="LadyAud.c13.s21">Robert could not tell how long the person had been knocking.</s> <s sid="22" id="LadyAud.c13.s22">He had mixed the sound with his dreams, and when he woke he was only half conscious of other things.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="LadyAud.c13.p14"><s sid="26" id="LadyAud.c13.s26">The person, whoever it was, did knock again, and then desisted, apparently tired out; but about a minute afterward a key turned in the door.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="LadyAud.c13.p30"><s sid="50" id="LadyAud.c13.s50">But neither of these suppositions explained the telegraphic message, and it was the telegraphic message which had filled Robert's mind with a vague sense of alarm.</s> <s sid="51" id="LadyAud.c13.s51">The postman brought no letter from George Talboys, and the person who had knocked at the door of the chambers did not return between seven and nine o'clock, so Robert Audley left Figtree Court once more in search of his friend.</s> <s sid="52" id="LadyAud.c13.s52">This time he told the cabman to drive to the Euston Station, and in twenty minutes he was on the platform, making inquiries about the trains.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="LadyAud.c13.p31"><s sid="53" id="LadyAud.c13.s53">The Liverpool express had started half an hour before he reached the station, and he had to wait an hour and a quarter for a slow train to take him to his destination.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="LadyAud.c13.p33"><s sid="56" id="LadyAud.c13.s56">He bought the _Times_ newspaper, and looked instinctively at the second column, with a morbid interest in the advertisements of people missing--sons, brothers, and husbands who had left their homes, never to return or to be heard of more.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="LadyAud.c13.p34"><s sid="57" id="LadyAud.c13.s57">There was one advertisement of a young man found drowned somewhere on the Lambeth shore.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="LadyAud.c13.p36"><s sid="60" id="LadyAud.c13.s60">It was eight o'clock in the evening when Robert got into Liverpool; too late for anything except to make inquiries as to what vessel had sailed within the last two days for the antipodes.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="LadyAud.c13.p37"><s sid="61" id="LadyAud.c13.s61">An emigrant ship had sailed at four o'clock that afternoon--the _Victoria Regia_, bound for Melbourne.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="LadyAud.c15.p2"><s sid="2" id="LadyAud.c15.s2">Upon a lowering morning late in November, with the yellow fog low upon the flat meadows, and the blinded cattle groping their way through the dim obscurity, and blundering stupidly against black and leafless hedges, or stumbling into ditches, undistinguishable in the hazy atmosphere; with the village church looming brown and dingy through the uncertain light; with every winding path and cottage door, every gable end and gray old chimney, every village child and straggling cur seeming strange and weird of aspect in the semi-darkness, Phoebe Marks and her Cousin Luke made their way through the churchyard of Audley, and presented themselves before a shivering curate, whose surplice hung in damp folds, soddened by the morning mist, and whose temper was not improved by his having waited five minutes for the bride and bridegroom.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="LadyAud.c15.p3" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="LadyAud.c15.s3">Luke Marks, dressed in his ill-fitting Sunday clothes, looked by no means handsomer than in his every-day apparel; but Phoebe, arrayed in a rustling silk of delicate gray, that had been worn about half a dozen times by her mistress, looked, as the few spectators of the ceremony remarked, <qs/>"quite the lady."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="LadyAud.c15.p4"><s sid="4" id="LadyAud.c15.s4">A very dim and shadowy lady, vague of outline, and faint of coloring, with eyes, hair, complexion and dress all melting into such pale and uncertain shades that, in the obscure light of the foggy November morning a superstitious stranger might have mistaken the bride for the ghost of some other bride, dead and buried in the vault below the church.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="LadyAud.c15.p5"><s sid="5" id="LadyAud.c15.s5">Mr. Luke Marks, the hero of the occasion, thought very little of all this.</s> <s sid="6" id="LadyAud.c15.s6">He had secured the wife of his choice, and the object of his life-long ambition--a public house.</s> <s sid="7" id="LadyAud.c15.s7">My lady had provided the seventy-five pounds necessary for the purchase of the good-will and fixtures, with the stock of ales and spirits, of a small inn in the center of a lonely little village, perched on the summit of a hill, and called Mount Stanning.</s> <s sid="8" id="LadyAud.c15.s8">It was not a very pretty house to look at; it had something of a tumble-down, weather-beaten appearance, standing, as it did, upon high ground, sheltered only by four or five bare and overgrown poplars, that had shot up too rapidly for their strength, and had a blighted, forlorn look in consequence.</s> <s sid="9" id="LadyAud.c15.s9">The wind had had its own way with the Castle Inn, and had sometimes made cruel use of its power.</s> <s sid="10" id="LadyAud.c15.s10">It was the wind that battered and bent the low, thatched roofs of outhouses and stables, till they hung over and lurched forward, as a slouched hat hangs over the low forehead of some village ruffian; it was the wind that shook and rattled the wooden shutters before the narrow casements, till they hung broken and dilapidated upon their rusty hinges; it was the wind that overthrew the pigeon house, and broke the vane that had been imprudently set up to tell the movements of its mightiness; it, was the wind that made light of any little bit of wooden trellis-work, or creeping plant, or tiny balcony, or any modest decoration whatsoever, and tore and scattered it in its scornful fury; it was the wind that left mossy secretions on the discolored surface of the plaster walls; it was the wind, in short, that shattered, and ruined, and rent, and trampled upon the tottering pile of buildings, and then flew shrieking off, to riot and glory in its destroying strength.</s> <s sid="11" id="LadyAud.c15.s11">The dispirited proprietor grew tired of his long struggle with this mighty enemy; so the wind was left to work its own will, and the Castle Inn fell slowly to decay.</s> <s sid="12" id="LadyAud.c15.s12">But for all that it suffered without, it was not the less prosperous within doors.</s> <s sid="13" id="LadyAud.c15.s13">Sturdy drovers stopped to drink at the little bar; well-to-do farmers spent their evenings and talked politics in the low, wainscoted parlor, while their horses munched some suspicious mixture of moldy hay and tolerable beans in the tumble-down stables.</s> <s sid="14" id="LadyAud.c15.s14">Sometimes even the members of the Audley hunt stopped to drink and bait their horses at the Castle Inn; while, on one grand and never-to-be-forgotten occasion, a dinner had been ordered by the master of the hounds for some thirty gentlemen, and the proprietor driven nearly mad by the importance of the demand.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="LadyAud.c15.p11"><s sid="26" id="LadyAud.c15.s26">He lifted the shivering girl into the chaise, wrapped a rough great-coat about her, and drove off through the yellow fog, followed by a feeble cheer from two or three urchins clustered around the gate.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="LadyAud.c15.p12"><s sid="27" id="LadyAud.c15.s27">A new maid was brought from London to replace Phoebe Marks about the person of my lady--a very showy damsel, who wore a black satin gown, and rose-colored ribbons in her cap, and complained bitterly of the dullness of Audley Court.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="LadyAud.c15.p13"><s sid="28" id="LadyAud.c15.s28">But Christmas brought visitors to the rambling old mansion.</s> <s sid="29" id="LadyAud.c15.s29">A country squire and his fat wife occupied the tapestried chamber; merry girls scampered up and down the long passages, and young men stared out of the latticed windows, watching for southerly winds and cloudy skies; there was not an empty stall in the roomy old stables; an extempore forge had been set up in the yard for the shoeing of hunters; yelping dogs made the place noisy with their perpetual clamor; strange servants herded together on the garret story; and every little casement hidden away under some pointed gable, and every dormer window in the quaint old roof, glimmered upon the winter's night with its separate taper, till, coming suddenly upon Audley Court, the benighted stranger, misled by the light, and noise, and bustle of the place, might have easily fallen into young Marlowe's error, and have mistaken the hospitable mansion for a good, old-fashioned inn, such as have faded from this earth since the last mail coach and prancing tits took their last melancholy journey to the knacker's yard.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="LadyAud.c15.p14"><s sid="30" id="LadyAud.c15.s30">Among other visitors Mr. Robert Audley came down to Essex for the hunting season, with half a dozen French novels, a case of cigars, and three pounds of Turkish tobacco in his portmanteau.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="LadyAud.c15.p16"><s sid="32" id="LadyAud.c15.s32">The young barrister had brought a couple of dogs with him; and the country gentleman who gave fifty pounds for a pointer; and traveled a couple of hundred miles to look at a leash of setters before be struck a bargain, laughed aloud at the two miserable curs, one of which had followed Robert Audley through Chancery Lane, and half the length of Holborn; while his companion had been taken by the barrister _vi et armis_ from a coster-monger who was ill-using him.</s> <s sid="33" id="LadyAud.c15.s33">And as Robert furthermore insisted on having these two deplorable animals under his easy-chair in the drawing-room, much to the annoyance of my lady, who, as we know, hated all dogs, the visitors at Audley Court looked upon the baronet's nephew as an inoffensive species of maniac.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="LadyAud.c15.p17"><s sid="34" id="LadyAud.c15.s34">During other visits to the Court Robert Audley had made a feeble show of joining in the sports of the merry assembly.</s> <s sid="35" id="LadyAud.c15.s35">He had jogged across half a dozen ploughed fields on a quiet gray pony of Sir Michael's, and drawing up breathless and panting at door of some farm-house, had expressed his intention of following the hounds no further _that_ morning.</s> <s sid="36" id="LadyAud.c15.s36">He had even gone so far as to put on, with great labor, a pair of skates, with a view to taking a turn on the frozen surface of the fishpond, and had fallen ignominously at the first attempt, lying placidly extended on the flat of his back until such time as the bystanders should think fit to pick him up.</s> <s sid="37" id="LadyAud.c15.s37">He had occupied the back seat in a dog-cart during a pleasant morning drive, vehemently protesting against being taken up hill, and requiring the vehicle to be stopped every ten minutes in order to readjust the cushions.</s> <s sid="38" id="LadyAud.c15.s38">But this year he showed no inclination for any of these outdoor amusements, and he spent his time entirely in lounging in the drawing-room, and making himself agreeable, after his own lazy fashion, to my lady and Alicia.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="LadyAud.c19.p2"><s sid="2" id="LadyAud.c19.s2">It was exactly five minutes past four as Mr. Robert Audley stepped out upon the platform at Shoreditch, and waited placidly until such time as his dogs and his portmanteau should be delivered up to the attendant porter who had called his cab, and undertaken the general conduct of his affairs, with that disinterested courtesy which does such infinite credit to a class of servitors who are forbidden to accept the tribute of a grateful public.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="LadyAud.c20.p2"><s sid="5" id="LadyAud.c20.s5">Robert Audley had answered this letter by a few indignant lines, informing Mr. Talboys that his son was scarcely likely to hide himself for the furtherance of any deep-laid design on the pockets of his relatives, as he had left twenty thousand pounds in his bankers' hands at the time of his disappearance.</s> <s sid="6" id="LadyAud.c20.s6">After dispatching this letter, Robert had abandoned all thought of assistance from the man who, in the natural course of things, should have been most interested in George's fate; but now that he found himself advancing every day some step nearer to the end that lay so darkly before him, his mind reverted to this heartlessly indifferent Mr. Harcourt Talboys.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="LadyAud.c22.p2"><s sid="2" id="LadyAud.c22.s2">Mr. Harcourt Talboys lived in a prim, square, red-brick mansion, within a mile of a little village called Grange Heath, in Dorsetshire.</s> <s sid="3" id="LadyAud.c22.s3">The prim, square, red-brick mansion stood in the center of prim, square grounds, scarcely large enough to be called a park, too large to be called anything else--so neither the house nor the grounds had any name, and the estate was simply designated Squire Talboys'.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="LadyAud.c22.p3"><s sid="4" id="LadyAud.c22.s4">Perhaps Mr. Harcourt Talboys was the last person in this world with whom it was possible to associate the homely, hearty, rural old English title of squire.</s> <s sid="5" id="LadyAud.c22.s5">He neither hunted nor farmed.</s> <s sid="6" id="LadyAud.c22.s6">He had never worn crimson, pink, or top-boots in his life.</s> <s sid="7" id="LadyAud.c22.s7">A southerly wind and a cloudy sky were matters of supreme indifference to him, so long as they did not in any way interfere with his own prim comforts; and he only cared for the state of the crops inasmuch as it involved the hazard of certain rents which he received for the farms upon his estate.</s> <s sid="8" id="LadyAud.c22.s8">He was a man of about fifty years of age, tall, straight, bony and angular, with a square, pale face, light gray eyes, and scanty dark hair, brushed from either ear across a bald crown, and thus imparting to his physiognomy some faint resemblance to that of a terrier--a sharp, uncompromising, hard-headed terrier--a terrier not to be taken in by the cleverest dog-stealer who ever distinguished himself in his profession.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="LadyAud.c22.p4"><s sid="9" id="LadyAud.c22.s9">Nobody ever remembered getting upon what is popularly called the blind side of Harcourt Talboys.</s> <s sid="10" id="LadyAud.c22.s10">He was like his own square-built, northern-fronted, shelterless house.</s> <s sid="11" id="LadyAud.c22.s11">There were no shady nooks in his character into which one could creep for shelter from his hard daylight.</s> <s sid="12" id="LadyAud.c22.s12">He was all daylight.</s> <s sid="13" id="LadyAud.c22.s13">He looked at everything in the same broad glare of intellectual sunlight, and would see no softening shadows that might alter the sharp outlines of cruel facts, subduing them to beauty.</s> <s sid="14" id="LadyAud.c22.s14">I do not know if I express what I mean, when I say that there were no curves in his character--that his mind ran in straight lines, never diverging to the right or the left to round off their pitiless angles.</s> <s sid="15" id="LadyAud.c22.s15">With him right was right, and wrong was wrong.</s> <s sid="16" id="LadyAud.c22.s16">He had never in his merciless, conscientious life admitted the idea that circumstances might mitigate the blackness of wrong or weaken the force of right.</s> <s sid="17" id="LadyAud.c22.s17">He had cast off his only son because his only son had disobeyed him, and he was ready to cast off his only daughter at five minutes' notice for the same reason.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="LadyAud.c22.p6"><s sid="22" id="LadyAud.c22.s22">If he had regretted his son's marriage, and the breach of his own making, between himself and George, his vanity had been more powerful than his regret, and had enabled him to conceal it.</s> <s sid="23" id="LadyAud.c22.s23">Indeed, unlikely as it appears at the first glance that such a man as this could have been vain, I have little doubt that vanity was the center from which radiated all the disagreeable lines in the character of Mr. Harcourt Talboys.</s> <s sid="24" id="LadyAud.c22.s24">I dare say Junius Brutus was vain, and enjoyed the approval of awe-stricken Rome when he ordered his son off for execution.</s> <s sid="25" id="LadyAud.c22.s25">Harcourt Talboys would have sent poor George from his presence between the reversed fasces of the lictors, and grimly relished his own agony.</s> <s sid="26" id="LadyAud.c22.s26">Heaven only knows how bitterly this hard man may have felt the separation between himself and his only son, or how much the more terrible the anguish might have been made by that unflinching self-conceit which concealed the torture.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="LadyAud.c22.p8"><s sid="32" id="LadyAud.c22.s32">I believe that Harcourt Talboys hugged himself upon the gloomy Roman grandeur of this speech, and that he would like to have worn a toga, and wrapped himself sternly in its folds, as he turned his back upon poor George's intercessor.</s> <s sid="33" id="LadyAud.c22.s33">George never in his own person made any effort to soften his father's verdict.</s> <s sid="34" id="LadyAud.c22.s34">He knew his father well enough to know that the case was hopeless.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="LadyAud.c22.p9" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="LadyAud.c22.s35"><qs/>"If I write to him, he will fold my letter with the envelope inside, and indorse it with my name and the date of its arrival,"<qe/><sls/> the young man would say, <sle/><qs/>"and call everybody in the house to witness that it had not moved him to one softening recollection or one pitiful thought.</s> <s sid="36" id="LadyAud.c22.s36">He will stick to his resolution to his dying day.</s> <s sid="37" id="LadyAud.c22.s37">I dare say, if the truth was known, he is glad that his only son has offended him and given him the opportunity of parading his Roman virtues."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="LadyAud.c22.p10"><s sid="38" id="LadyAud.c22.s38">George had answered his wife thus when she and her father had urged him to ask assistance from Harcourt Talboys.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="LadyAud.c22.p12"><s sid="43" id="LadyAud.c22.s43">Perhaps poor Mrs. George did not agree very heartily to the first of these two propositions.</s> <s sid="44" id="LadyAud.c22.s44">She had no great fancy for starving, and she whimpered pitifully when the pretty pint bottles of champagne, with Cliquot's and Moet's brands upon their corks, were exchanged for sixpenny ale, procured by a slipshod attendant from the nearest beer-shop.</s> <s sid="45" id="LadyAud.c22.s45">George had been obliged to carry his own burden and lend a helping hand with that of his wife, who had no idea of keeping her regrets or disappointments a secret.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="LadyAud.c22.p13" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="LadyAud.c22.s46"><qs/>"I thought dragoons were always rich,"<qe/> she used to say, peevishly.</s> <s sid="47" id="LadyAud.c22.s47"><qs/>"Girls always want to marry dragoons; and tradespeople always want to serve dragoons; and hotel-keepers to entertain dragoons; and theatrical managers to be patronized by dragoons.</s> <s sid="48" id="LadyAud.c22.s48">Who could have ever expected that a dragoon would drink sixpenny ale, smoke horrid bird's-eye tobacco, and let his wife wear a shabby bonnet?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="LadyAud.c22.p14"><s sid="49" id="LadyAud.c22.s49">If there were any selfish feelings displayed in such speeches as these, George Talboys had never discovered it.</s> <s sid="50" id="LadyAud.c22.s50">He had loved and believed in his wife from the first to the last hour of his brief married life.</s> <s sid="51" id="LadyAud.c22.s51">The love that is not blind is perhaps only a spurious divinity after all; for when Cupid takes the fillet from his eyes it is a fatally certain indication that he is preparing to spread his wings for a flight.</s> <s sid="52" id="LadyAud.c22.s52">George never forgot the hour in which he had first become bewitched by Lieutenant Maldon's pretty daughter, and however she might have changed, the image which had charmed him then, unchanged and unchanging, represented her in his heart.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="LadyAud.c22.p15"><s sid="53" id="LadyAud.c22.s53">Robert Audley left Southampton by a train which started before daybreak, and reached Wareham station early in the day.</s> <s sid="54" id="LadyAud.c22.s54">He hired a vehicle at Wareham to take him over to Grange Heath.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="LadyAud.c22.p16"><s sid="55" id="LadyAud.c22.s55">The snow had hardened upon the ground, and the day was clear and frosty, every object in the landscape standing in sharp outline against the cold blue sky.</s> <s sid="56" id="LadyAud.c22.s56">The horses' hoofs clattered upon the ice-bound road, the iron shoes striking on the ground that was almost as iron as themselves.</s> <s sid="57" id="LadyAud.c22.s57">The wintry day bore some resemblance to the man to whom Robert was going.</s> <s sid="58" id="LadyAud.c22.s58">Like him, it was sharp, frigid, and uncompromising: like him, it was merciless to distress and impregnable to the softening power of sunshine.</s> <s sid="59" id="LadyAud.c22.s59">It would accept no sunshine but such January radiance as would light up the bleak, bare country without brightening it; and thus resembled Harcourt Talboys, who took the sternest side of every truth, and declared loudly to the disbelieving world that there never had been, and never could be, any other side.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="LadyAud.c22.p17"><s sid="60" id="LadyAud.c22.s60">Robert Audley's heart sunk within him as the shabby hired vehicle stopped at a stern-looking barred fence, and the driver dismounted to open a broad iron gate which swung back with a clanking noise and was caught by a great iron tooth, planted in the ground, which snapped at the lowest bar of the gate as if it wanted to bite.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="LadyAud.c22.p18"><s sid="61" id="LadyAud.c22.s61">This iron gate opened into a scanty plantation of straight-limbed fir-trees, that grew in rows and shook their sturdy winter foliage defiantly in the very teeth of the frosty breeze.</s> <s sid="62" id="LadyAud.c22.s62">A straight graveled carriage-drive ran between these straight trees across a smoothly kept lawn to a square red-brick mansion, every window of which winked and glittered in the January sunlight as if it had been that moment cleaned by some indefatigable housemaid.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="LadyAud.c22.p19"><s sid="63" id="LadyAud.c22.s63">I don't know whether Junius Brutus was a nuisance in his own house, but among other of his Roman virtues, Mr. Talboys owned an extreme aversion to disorder, and was the terror of every domestic in his establishment.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="LadyAud.c22.p20"><s sid="64" id="LadyAud.c22.s64">The windows winked and the flight of stone steps glared in the sunlight, the prim garden walks were so freshly graveled that they gave a sandy, gingery aspect to the place, reminding one unpleasantly of red hair.</s> <s sid="65" id="LadyAud.c22.s65">The lawn was chiefly ornamented with dark, wintry shrubs of a funereal aspect which grew in beds that looked like problems in algebra; and the flight of stone steps leading to the square half-glass door of the hall was adorned with dark-green wooden tubs containing the same sturdy evergreens.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="LadyAud.c22.p21" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="LadyAud.c22.s66"><qs/>"If the man is anything like his house,"<qe/><sss/> Robert thought, <sse/><qs/>"I don't wonder that poor George and he parted."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="LadyAud.c22.p22"><s sid="67" id="LadyAud.c22.s67">At the end of a scanty avenue the carriage-drive turned a sharp corner (it would have been made to describe a curve in any other man's grounds) and ran before the lower windows of the house.</s> <s sid="68" id="LadyAud.c22.s68">The flyman dismounted at the steps, ascended them, and rang a brass-handled bell, which flew back to its socket, with an angry, metallic snap, as if it had been insulted by the plebeian touch of the man's hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="LadyAud.c22.p23"><s sid="69" id="LadyAud.c22.s69">A man in black trousers and a striped linen jacket, which was evidently fresh from the hands of the laundress, opened the door.</s> <s sid="70" id="LadyAud.c22.s70">Mr. Talboys was at home.</s> <s sid="71" id="LadyAud.c22.s71">Would the gentleman send in his card?</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="LadyAud.c22.p24"><s sid="72" id="LadyAud.c22.s72">Robert waited in the hall while his card was taken to the master of the house.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="LadyAud.c22.p25"><s sid="73" id="LadyAud.c22.s73">The hall was large and lofty, paved with stone.</s> <s sid="74" id="LadyAud.c22.s74">The panels of the oaken wainscot shone with the same uncompromising polish which was on every object within and without the red-bricked mansion.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="LadyAud.c22.p30"><s sid="83" id="LadyAud.c22.s83">This was intended as a stately reproof to Mr. Robert Audley.</s> <s sid="84" id="LadyAud.c22.s84">It had, however, very small effect upon the young barrister.</s> <s sid="85" id="LadyAud.c22.s85">He merely lifted his eyebrows in placid deprecation of himself and everybody else.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="LadyAud.c22.p32"><s sid="89" id="LadyAud.c22.s89">The emotionless man looked at Robert Audley with a vacant stare of unmitigated horror, and opening one of the heavy oak doors, led the way into a large dining-room furnished with the severe simplicity of an apartment which is meant to be ate in, but never lived in; and at top of a table which would have accommodated eighteen persons Robert beheld Mr. Harcourt Talboys.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="LadyAud.c22.p33"><s sid="90" id="LadyAud.c22.s90">Mr. Talboys was robed in a dressing-gown of gray cloth, fastened about his waist with a girdle.</s> <s sid="91" id="LadyAud.c22.s91">It was a severe looking garment, and was perhaps the nearest approach to the toga to be obtained within the range of modern costume.</s> <s sid="92" id="LadyAud.c22.s92">He wore a buff waistcoat, a stiffly starched cambric cravat, and a faultless shirt collar.</s> <s sid="93" id="LadyAud.c22.s93">The cold gray of his dressing gown was almost the same as the cold gray of his eyes, and the pale buff of his waistcoat was the pale buff of his complexion.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="LadyAud.c22.p34"><s sid="94" id="LadyAud.c22.s94">Robert Audley had not expected to find Harcourt Talboys at all like George in his manners or disposition, but he had expected to see some family likeness between the father and the son.</s> <s sid="95" id="LadyAud.c22.s95">There was none.</s> <s sid="96" id="LadyAud.c22.s96">It would have been impossible to imagine any one more unlike George than the author of his existence.</s> <s sid="97" id="LadyAud.c22.s97">Robert scarcely wondered at the cruel letter he received from Mr. Talboys when he saw the writer of it.</s> <s sid="98" id="LadyAud.c22.s98">Such a man could scarcely have written otherwise.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="LadyAud.c22.p35"><s sid="99" id="LadyAud.c22.s99">There was a second person in the large room, toward whom Robert glanced after saluting Harcourt Talboys, doubtful how to proceed.</s> <s sid="100" id="LadyAud.c22.s100">This second person was a lady, who sat at the last of a range of four windows, employed with some needlework, the kind which is generally called plain work, and with a large wicker basket, filled with calicoes and flannels, standing by her.</s> </p>
