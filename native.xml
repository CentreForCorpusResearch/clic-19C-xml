<stru>AUTHOR'S PREFACE





The date at which the following events are assumed to have occurred

may be set down as between 1840 and 1850, when the old watering-place

herein called "Budmouth" still retained sufficient afterglow from its

Georgian gaiety and prestige to lend it an absorbing attractiveness to

the romantic and imaginative soul of a lonely dweller inland.



Under the general name of "Egdon Heath," which has been given to the

sombre scene of the story, are united or typified heaths of various

real names, to the number of at least a dozen; these being virtually

one in character and aspect, though their original unity, or partial

unity, is now somewhat disguised by intrusive strips and slices

brought under the plough with varying degrees of success, or planted

to woodland.



It is pleasant to dream that some spot in the extensive tract whose

south-western quarter is here described, may be the heath of that

traditionary King of Wessex--Lear.



July 1895</stru>







<stru>POSTSCRIPT





To prevent disappointment to searchers for scenery it should be added

that though the action of the narrative is supposed to proceed in the

central and most secluded part of the heaths united into one whole,

as above described, certain topographical features resembling those

delineated really lie on the margin of the waste, several miles to the

westward of the centre. In some other respects also there has been a

bringing together of scattered characteristics.



The first edition of this novel was published in three volumes in

1878.

THE THREE WOMEN</stru>

<title>I A Face on Which Time Makes But Little Impression</title>

<p pid="1" id="native.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="native.c1.s1">A Saturday afternoon in November was approaching the time of twilight, and the vast tract of unenclosed wild known as Egdon Heath embrowned itself moment by moment.</s> <s sid="2" id="native.c1.s2">Overhead the hollow stretch of whitish cloud shutting out the sky was as a tent which had the whole heath for its floor.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="native.c1.p2"><s sid="3" id="native.c1.s3">The heaven being spread with this pallid screen and the earth with the darkest vegetation, their meeting-line at the horizon was clearly marked.</s> <s sid="4" id="native.c1.s4">In such contrast the heath wore the appearance of an instalment of night which had taken up its place before its astronomical hour was come: darkness had to a great extent arrived hereon, while day stood distinct in the sky.</s> <s sid="5" id="native.c1.s5">Looking upwards, a furze-cutter would have been inclined to continue work; looking down, he would have decided to finish his faggot and go home.</s> <s sid="6" id="native.c1.s6">The distant rims of the world and of the firmament seemed to be a division in time no less than a division in matter.</s> <s sid="7" id="native.c1.s7">The face of the heath by its mere complexion added half an hour to evening; it could in like manner retard the dawn, sadden noon, anticipate the frowning of storms scarcely generated, and intensify the opacity of a moonless midnight to a cause of shaking and dread.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="native.c1.p3"><s sid="8" id="native.c1.s8">In fact, precisely at this transitional point of its nightly roll into darkness the great and particular glory of the Egdon waste began, and nobody could be said to understand the heath who had not been there at such a time.</s> <s sid="9" id="native.c1.s9">It could best be felt when it could not clearly be seen, its complete effect and explanation lying in this and the succeeding hours before the next dawn; then, and only then, did it tell its true tale.</s> <s sid="10" id="native.c1.s10">The spot was, indeed, a near relation of night, and when night showed itself an apparent tendency to gravitate together could be perceived in its shades and the scene.</s> <s sid="11" id="native.c1.s11">The sombre stretch of rounds and hollows seemed to rise and meet the evening gloom in pure sympathy, the heath exhaling darkness as rapidly as the heavens precipitated it.</s> <s sid="12" id="native.c1.s12">And so the obscurity in the air and the obscurity in the land closed together in a black fraternization towards which each advanced half-way.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="native.c1.p4"><s sid="13" id="native.c1.s13">The place became full of a watchful intentness now; for when other things sank blooding to sleep the heath appeared slowly to awake and listen.</s> <s sid="14" id="native.c1.s14">Every night its Titanic form seemed to await something; but it had waited thus, unmoved, during so many centuries, through the crises of so many things, that it could only be imagined to await one last crisis--the final overthrow.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="native.c1.p5"><s sid="15" id="native.c1.s15">It was a spot which returned upon the memory of those who loved it with an aspect of peculiar and kindly congruity.</s> <s sid="16" id="native.c1.s16">Smiling champaigns of flowers and fruit hardly do this, for they are permanently harmonious only with an existence of better reputation as to its issues than the present.</s> <s sid="17" id="native.c1.s17">Twilight combined with the scenery of Egdon Heath to evolve a thing majestic without severity, impressive without showiness, emphatic in its admonitions, grand in its simplicity.</s> <s sid="18" id="native.c1.s18">The qualifications which frequently invest the facade of a prison with far more dignity than is found in the facade of a palace double its size lent to this heath a sublimity in which spots renowned for beauty of the accepted kind are utterly wanting.</s> <s sid="19" id="native.c1.s19">Fair prospects wed happily with fair times; but alas, if times be not fair!</s> <s sid="20" id="native.c1.s20">Men have oftener suffered from the mockery of a place too smiling for their reason than from the oppression of surroundings oversadly tinged.</s> <s sid="21" id="native.c1.s21">Haggard Egdon appealed to a subtler and scarcer instinct, to a more recently learnt emotion, than that which responds to the sort of beauty called charming and fair.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="native.c1.p6"><s sid="22" id="native.c1.s22">Indeed, it is a question if the exclusive reign of this orthodox beauty is not approaching its last quarter.</s> <s sid="23" id="native.c1.s23">The new Vale of Tempe may be a gaunt waste in Thule; human souls may find themselves in closer and closer harmony with external things wearing a sombreness distasteful to our race when it was young.</s> <s sid="24" id="native.c1.s24">The time seems near, if it has not actually arrived, when the chastened sublimity of a moor, a sea, or a mountain will be all of nature that is absolutely in keeping with the moods of the more thinking among mankind.</s> <s sid="25" id="native.c1.s25">And ultimately, to the commonest tourist, spots like Iceland may become what the vineyards and myrtle-gardens of South Europe are to him now; and Heidelberg and Baden be passed unheeded as he hastens from the Alps to the sand-dunes of Scheveningen.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="native.c1.p7"><s sid="26" id="native.c1.s26">The most thorough-going ascetic could feel that he had a natural right to wander on Egdon: he was keeping within the line of legitimate indulgence when he laid himself open to influences such as these.</s> <s sid="27" id="native.c1.s27">Colours and beauties so far subdued were, at least, the birthright of all.</s> <s sid="28" id="native.c1.s28">Only in summer days of highest feather did its mood touch the level of gaiety.</s> <s sid="29" id="native.c1.s29">Intensity was more usually reached by way of the solemn than by way of the brilliant, and such a sort of intensity was often arrived at during winter darkness, tempests, and mists.</s> <s sid="30" id="native.c1.s30">Then Egdon was aroused to reciprocity; for the storm was its lover, and the wind its friend.</s> <s sid="31" id="native.c1.s31">Then it became the home of strange phantoms; and it was found to be the hitherto unrecognized original of those wild regions of obscurity which are vaguely felt to be compassing us about in midnight dreams of flight and disaster, and are never thought of after the dream till revived by scenes like this.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="native.c1.p8"><s sid="32" id="native.c1.s32">It was at present a place perfectly accordant with man's nature--neither ghastly, hateful, nor ugly; neither commonplace, unmeaning, nor tame; but, like man, slighted and enduring; and withal singularly colossal and mysterious in its swarthy monotony.</s> <s sid="33" id="native.c1.s33">As with some persons who have long lived apart, solitude seemed to look out of its countenance.</s> <s sid="34" id="native.c1.s34">It had a lonely face, suggesting tragical possibilities.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="native.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="native.c1.s35">This obscure, obsolete, superseded country figures in Domesday.</s> <s sid="36" id="native.c1.s36">Its condition is recorded therein as that of heathy, furzy, briary wilderness--<qs/>"Bruaria."<qe/></s> <s sid="37" id="native.c1.s37">Then follows the length and breadth in leagues; and, though some uncertainty exists as to the exact extent of this ancient lineal measure, it appears from the figures that the area of Egdon down to the present day has but little diminished.</s> <s sid="38" id="native.c1.s38"><qs/>"Turbaria Bruaria"<qe/>--the right of cutting heath-turf--occurs in charters relating to the district.</s> <s sid="39" id="native.c1.s39"><qs/>"Overgrown with heth and mosse,"<qe/> says Leland of the same dark sweep of country.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="native.c1.p10"><s sid="40" id="native.c1.s40">Here at least were intelligible facts regarding landscape--far-reaching proofs productive of genuine satisfaction.</s> <s sid="41" id="native.c1.s41">The untameable, Ishmaelitish thing that Egdon now was it always had been.</s> <s sid="42" id="native.c1.s42">Civilization was its enemy; and ever since the beginning of vegetation its soil had worn the same antique brown dress, the natural and invariable garment of the particular formation.</s> <s sid="43" id="native.c1.s43">In its venerable one coat lay a certain vein of satire on human vanity in clothes.</s> <s sid="44" id="native.c1.s44">A person on a heath in raiment of modern cut and colours has more or less an anomalous look.</s> <s sid="45" id="native.c1.s45">We seem to want the oldest and simplest human clothing where the clothing of the earth is so primitive.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="native.c1.p11"><s sid="46" id="native.c1.s46">To recline on a stump of thorn in the central valley of Egdon, between afternoon and night, as now, where the eye could reach nothing of the world outside the summits and shoulders of heathland which filled the whole circumference of its glance, and to know that everything around and underneath had been from prehistoric times as unaltered as the stars overhead, gave ballast to the mind adrift on change, and harassed by the irrepressible New.</s> <s sid="47" id="native.c1.s47">The great inviolate place had an ancient permanence which the sea cannot claim.</s> <s sid="48" id="native.c1.s48">Who can say of a particular sea that it is old?</s> <s sid="49" id="native.c1.s49">Distilled by the sun, kneaded by the moon, it is renewed in a year, in a day, or in an hour.</s> <s sid="50" id="native.c1.s50">The sea changed, the fields changed, the rivers, the villages, and the people changed, yet Egdon remained.</s> <s sid="51" id="native.c1.s51">Those surfaces were neither so steep as to be destructible by weather, nor so flat as to be the victims of floods and deposits.</s> <s sid="52" id="native.c1.s52">With the exception of an aged highway, and a still more aged barrow presently to be referred to--themselves almost crystallized to natural products by long continuance--even the trifling irregularities were not caused by pickaxe, plough, or spade, but remained as the very finger-touches of the last geological change.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="native.c1.p12"><s sid="53" id="native.c1.s53">The above-mentioned highway traversed the lower levels of the heath, from one horizon to another.</s> <s sid="54" id="native.c1.s54">In many portions of its course it overlaid an old vicinal way, which branched from the great Western road of the Romans, the Via Iceniana, or Ikenild Street, hard by.</s> <s sid="55" id="native.c1.s55">On the evening under consideration it would have been noticed that, though the gloom had increased sufficiently to confuse the minor features of the heath, the white surface of the road remained almost as clear as ever.</s> </p></div>

<title>II Humanity Appears upon the Scene, Hand in Hand with Trouble</title>

<p pid="1" id="native.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="native.c2.s1">Along the road walked an old man.</s> <s sid="2" id="native.c2.s2">He was white-headed as a mountain, bowed in the shoulders, and faded in general aspect.</s> <s sid="3" id="native.c2.s3">He wore a glazed hat, an ancient boat-cloak, and shoes; his brass buttons bearing an anchor upon their face.</s> <s sid="4" id="native.c2.s4">In his hand was a silver-headed walking-stick, which he used as a veritable third leg, perseveringly dotting the ground with its point at every few inches' interval.</s> <s sid="5" id="native.c2.s5">One would have said that he had been, in his day, a naval officer of some sort or other.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="native.c2.p2"><s sid="6" id="native.c2.s6">Before him stretched the long, laborious road, dry, empty, and white.</s> <s sid="7" id="native.c2.s7">It was quite open to the heath on each side, and bisected that vast dark surface like the parting-line on a head of black hair, diminishing and bending away on the furthest horizon.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="native.c2.p3"><s sid="8" id="native.c2.s8">The old man frequently stretched his eyes ahead to gaze over the tract that he had yet to traverse.</s> <s sid="9" id="native.c2.s9">At length he discerned, a long distance in front of him, a moving spot, which appeared to be a vehicle, and it proved to be going the same way as that in which he himself was journeying.</s> <s sid="10" id="native.c2.s10">It was the single atom of life that the scene contained, and it only served to render the general loneliness more evident.</s> <s sid="11" id="native.c2.s11">Its rate of advance was slow, and the old man gained upon it sensibly.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="native.c2.p4"><s sid="12" id="native.c2.s12">When he drew nearer he perceived it to be a spring van, ordinary in shape, but singular in colour, this being a lurid red.</s> <s sid="13" id="native.c2.s13">The driver walked beside it; and, like his van, he was completely red.</s> <s sid="14" id="native.c2.s14">One dye of that tincture covered his clothes, the cap upon his head, his boots, his face, and his hands.</s> <s sid="15" id="native.c2.s15">He was not temporarily overlaid with the colour; it permeated him.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="native.c2.p5"><s sid="16" id="native.c2.s16">The old man knew the meaning of this.</s> <s sid="17" id="native.c2.s17">The traveller with the cart was a reddleman--a person whose vocation it was to supply farmers with redding for their sheep.</s> <s sid="18" id="native.c2.s18">He was one of a class rapidly becoming extinct in Wessex, filling at present in the rural world the place which, during the last century, the dodo occupied in the world of animals.</s> <s sid="19" id="native.c2.s19">He is a curious, interesting, and nearly perished link between obsolete forms of life and those which generally prevail.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="native.c2.p6"><s sid="20" id="native.c2.s20">The decayed officer, by degrees, came up alongside his fellow-wayfarer, and wished him good evening.</s> <s sid="21" id="native.c2.s21">The reddleman turned his head, and replied in sad and occupied tones.</s> <s sid="22" id="native.c2.s22">He was young, and his face, if not exactly handsome, approached so near to handsome that nobody would have contradicted an assertion that it really was so in its natural colour.</s> <s sid="23" id="native.c2.s23">His eye, which glared so strangely through his stain, was in itself attractive--keen as that of a bird of prey, and blue as autumn mist.</s> <s sid="24" id="native.c2.s24">He had neither whisker nor moustache, which allowed the soft curves of the lower part of his face to be apparent.</s> <s sid="25" id="native.c2.s25">His lips were thin, and though, as it seemed, compressed by thought, there was a pleasant twitch at their corners now and then.</s> <s sid="26" id="native.c2.s26">He was clothed throughout in a tight-fitting suit of corduroy, excellent in quality, not much worn, and well-chosen for its purpose, but deprived of its original colour by his trade.</s> <s sid="27" id="native.c2.s27">It showed to advantage the good shape of his figure.</s> <s sid="28" id="native.c2.s28">A certain well-to-do air about the man suggested that he was not poor for his degree.</s> <s sid="29" id="native.c2.s29">The natural query of an observer would have been, Why should such a promising being as this have hidden his prepossessing exterior by adopting that singular occupation?</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="native.c2.p7"><s sid="30" id="native.c2.s30">After replying to the old man's greeting he showed no inclination to continue in talk, although they still walked side by side, for the elder traveller seemed to desire company.</s> <s sid="31" id="native.c2.s31">There were no sounds but that of the booming wind upon the stretch of tawny herbage around them, the crackling wheels, the tread of the men, and the footsteps of the two shaggy ponies which drew the van.</s> <s sid="32" id="native.c2.s32">They were small, hardy animals, of a breed between Galloway and Exmoor, and were known as "heath-croppers" here.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="native.c2.p8"><s sid="33" id="native.c2.s33">Now, as they thus pursued their way, the reddleman occasionally left his companion's side, and, stepping behind the van, looked into its interior through a small window.</s> <s sid="34" id="native.c2.s34">The look was always anxious.</s> <s sid="35" id="native.c2.s35">He would then return to the old man, who made another remark about the state of the country and so on, to which the reddleman again abstractedly replied, and then again they would lapse into silence.</s> <s sid="36" id="native.c2.s36">The silence conveyed to neither any sense of awkwardness; in these lonely places wayfarers, after a first greeting, frequently plod on for miles without speech; contiguity amounts to a tacit conversation where, otherwise than in cities, such contiguity can be put an end to on the merest inclination, and where not to put an end to it is intercourse in itself.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="native.c2.p9" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="native.c2.s37">Possibly these two might not have spoken again till their parting, had it not been for the reddleman's visits to his van.</s> <s sid="38" id="native.c2.s38">When he returned from his fifth time of looking in the old man said, <qs/>"You have something inside there besides your load?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="native.c7.p16" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="native.c7.s68">She often repeated her prayers; not at particular times, but, like the unaffectedly devout, when she desired to pray.</s> <s sid="69" id="native.c7.s69">Her prayer was always spontaneous, and often ran thus, <qs/>"O deliver my heart from this fearful gloom and loneliness; send me great love from somewhere, else I shall die."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="native.c28.p5"><s sid="20" id="native.c28.s20">Her anxiety reached a high pitch; but there was something in Clym's undeviating manner which made her hesitate before sounding him on the subject.</s> <s sid="21" id="native.c28.s21">At this point in their experience, however, an incident helped her.</s> <s sid="22" id="native.c28.s22">It occurred one evening about six weeks after their union, and arose entirely out of the unconscious misapplication of Venn of the fifty guineas intended for Yeobright.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="native.c28.p6"><s sid="23" id="native.c28.s23">A day or two after the receipt of the money Thomasin had sent a note to her aunt to thank her.</s> <s sid="24" id="native.c28.s24">She had been surprised at the largeness of the amount; but as no sum had ever been mentioned she set that down to her late uncle's generosity.</s> <s sid="25" id="native.c28.s25">She had been strictly charged by her aunt to say nothing to her husband of this gift; and Wildeve, as was natural enough, had not brought himself to mention to his wife a single particular of the midnight scene in the heath.</s> <s sid="26" id="native.c28.s26">Christian's terror, in like manner, had tied his tongue on the share he took in that proceeding; and hoping that by some means or other the money had gone to its proper destination, he simply asserted as much, without giving details.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="native.c28.p7"><s sid="27" id="native.c28.s27">Therefore, when a week or two had passed away, Mrs. Yeobright began to wonder why she never heard from her son of the receipt of the present; and to add gloom to her perplexity came the possibility that resentment might be the cause of his silence.</s> <s sid="28" id="native.c28.s28">She could hardly believe as much, but why did he not write?</s> <s sid="29" id="native.c28.s29">She questioned Christian, and the confusion in his answers would at once have led her to believe that something was wrong, had not one-half of his story been corroborated by Thomasin's note.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="native.c28.p13"><s sid="43" id="native.c28.s43">She instantly dismissed the wretched Christian from her employ for his conduct in the affair; but, feeling quite helpless and unable to do without him, told him afterwards that he might stay a little longer if he chose.</s> <s sid="44" id="native.c28.s44">Then she hastened off to Eustacia, moved by a much less promising emotion towards her daughter-in-law than she had felt half an hour earlier, when planning her journey.</s> <s sid="45" id="native.c28.s45">At that time it was to inquire in a friendly spirit if there had been any accidental loss; now it was to ask plainly if Wildeve had privately given her money which had been intended as a sacred gift to Clym.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="native.c31.p2"><s sid="3" id="native.c31.s3">On this occasion Venn had arrived on Egdon Heath only to cross to the other side: he had no further connection with the interests of the Yeobright family, and he had a business of his own to attend to.</s> <s sid="4" id="native.c31.s4">Yet he suddenly began to feel himself drifting into the old track of manoeuvring on Thomasin's account.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="native.c31.p3"><s sid="5" id="native.c31.s5">He sat in his van and considered.</s> <s sid="6" id="native.c31.s6">From Thomasin's words and manner he had plainly gathered that Wildeve neglected her.</s> <s sid="7" id="native.c31.s7">For whom could he neglect her if not for Eustacia?</s> <s sid="8" id="native.c31.s8">Yet it was scarcely credible that things had come to such a head as to indicate that Eustacia systematically encouraged him.</s> <s sid="9" id="native.c31.s9">Venn resolved to reconnoitre somewhat carefully the lonely road which led along the vale from Wildeve's dwelling to Clym's house at Alderworth.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="native.c31.p4"><s sid="10" id="native.c31.s10">At this time, as had been seen, Wildeve was quite innocent of any predetermined act of intrigue, and except at the dance on the green he had not once met Eustacia since her marriage.</s> <s sid="11" id="native.c31.s11">But that the spirit of intrigue was in him had been shown by a recent romantic habit of his: a habit of going out after dark and strolling towards Alderworth, there looking at the moon and stars, looking at Eustacia's house, and walking back at leisure.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="native.c31.p5"><s sid="12" id="native.c31.s12">Accordingly, when watching on the night after the festival, the reddleman saw him ascend by the little path, lean over the front gate of Clym's garden, sigh, and turn to go back again.</s> <s sid="13" id="native.c31.s13">It was plain that Wildeve's intrigue was rather ideal than real.</s> <s sid="14" id="native.c31.s14">Venn retreated before him down the hill to a place where the path was merely a deep groove between the heather; here he mysteriously bent over the ground for a few minutes, and retired.</s> <s sid="15" id="native.c31.s15">When Wildeve came on to that spot his ankle was caught by something, and he fell headlong.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="native.c31.p6"><s sid="16" id="native.c31.s16">As soon as he had recovered the power of respiration he sat up and listened.</s> <s sid="17" id="native.c31.s17">There was not a sound in the gloom beyond the spiritless stir of the summer wind.</s> <s sid="18" id="native.c31.s18">Feeling about for the obstacle which had flung him down, he discovered that two tufts of heath had been tied together across the path, forming a loop, which to a traveller was certain overthrow.</s> <s sid="19" id="native.c31.s19">Wildeve pulled off the string that bound them, and went on with tolerable quickness.</s> <s sid="20" id="native.c31.s20">On reaching home he found the cord to be of a reddish colour.</s> <s sid="21" id="native.c31.s21">It was just what he had expected.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="native.c31.p7"><s sid="22" id="native.c31.s22">Although his weaknesses were not specially those akin to physical fear, the species of _coup-de-Jarnac_ from one he knew too well troubled the mind of Wildeve.</s> <s sid="23" id="native.c31.s23">But his movements were unaltered thereby.</s> <s sid="24" id="native.c31.s24">A night or two later he again went along the vale to Alderworth, taking the precaution of keeping out of any path.</s> <s sid="25" id="native.c31.s25">The sense that he was watched, that craft was employed to circumvent his errant tastes, added piquancy to a journey so entirely sentimental, so long as the danger was of no fearful sort.</s> <s sid="26" id="native.c31.s26">He imagined that Venn and Mrs. Yeobright were in league, and felt that there was a certain legitimacy in combating such a coalition.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="native.c31.p8"><s sid="27" id="native.c31.s27">The heath tonight appeared to be totally deserted: and Wildeve, after looking over Eustacia's garden gate for some little time, with a cigar in his mouth, was tempted by the fascination that emotional smuggling had for his nature to advance towards the window, which was not quite closed, the blind being only partly drawn down.</s> <s sid="28" id="native.c31.s28">He could see into the room, and Eustacia was sitting there alone.</s> <s sid="29" id="native.c31.s29">Wildeve contemplated her for a minute, and then retreating into the heath beat the ferns lightly, whereupon moths flew out alarmed.</s> <s sid="30" id="native.c31.s30">Securing one, he returned to the window, and holding the moth to the chink, opened his hand.</s> <s sid="31" id="native.c31.s31">The moth made towards the candle upon Eustacia's table, hovered round it two or three times, and flew into the flame.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="native.c31.p14"><s sid="43" id="native.c31.s43">She arose, but before she had time to get out of the room a loud rapping began upon the front door.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="native.c31.p17" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="native.c31.s47">She listened, and Clym opened the door.</s> <s sid="48" id="native.c31.s48">No words were uttered outside, and presently he closed it and came back, saying, <qs/>"Nobody was there.</s> <s sid="49" id="native.c31.s49">I wonder what that could have meant?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="native.c31.p18"><s sid="50" id="native.c31.s50">He was left to wonder during the rest of the evening, for no explanation offered itself, and Eustacia said nothing, the additional fact that she knew of only adding more mystery to the performance.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="native.c31.p19"><s sid="51" id="native.c31.s51">Meanwhile a little drama had been acted outside which saved Eustacia from all possibility of compromising herself that evening at least.</s> <s sid="52" id="native.c31.s52">While Wildeve had been preparing his moth-signal another person had come behind him up to the gate.</s> <s sid="53" id="native.c31.s53">This man, who carried a gun in his hand, looked on for a moment at the other's operation by the window, walked up to the house, knocked at the door, and then vanished round the corner and over the hedge.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="native.c31.p20" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="native.c31.s54"><qs/>"Damn him!"<qe/> said Wildeve.</s> <s sid="55" id="native.c31.s55"><qs/>"He has been watching me again."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="native.c31.p21"><s sid="56" id="native.c31.s56">As his signal had been rendered futile by this uproarious rapping Wildeve withdrew, passed out at the gate, and walked quickly down the path without thinking of anything except getting away unnoticed.</s> <s sid="57" id="native.c31.s57">Half-way down the hill the path ran near a knot of stunted hollies, which in the general darkness of the scene stood as the pupil in a black eye.</s> <s sid="58" id="native.c31.s58">When Wildeve reached this point a report startled his ear, and a few spent gunshots fell among the leaves around him.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="native.c31.p22"><s sid="59" id="native.c31.s59">There was no doubt that he himself was the cause of that gun's discharge; and he rushed into the clump of hollies, beating the bushes furiously with his stick; but nobody was there.</s> <s sid="60" id="native.c31.s60">This attack was a more serious matter than the last, and it was some time before Wildeve recovered his equanimity.</s> <s sid="61" id="native.c31.s61">A new and most unpleasant system of menace had begun, and the intent appeared to be to do him grievous bodily harm.</s> <s sid="62" id="native.c31.s62">Wildeve had looked upon Venn's first attempt as a species of horse-play, which the reddleman had indulged in for want of knowing better; but now the boundary line was passed which divides the annoying from the perilous.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="native.c31.p23"><s sid="63" id="native.c31.s63">Had Wildeve known how thoroughly in earnest Venn had become he might have been still more alarmed.</s> <s sid="64" id="native.c31.s64">The reddleman had been almost exasperated by the sight of Wildeve outside Clym's house, and he was prepared to go to any lengths short of absolutely shooting him, to terrify the young innkeeper out of his recalcitrant impulses.</s> <s sid="65" id="native.c31.s65">The doubtful legitimacy of such rough coercion did not disturb the mind of Venn.</s> <s sid="66" id="native.c31.s66">It troubles few such minds in such cases, and sometimes this is not to be regretted.</s> <s sid="67" id="native.c31.s67">From the impeachment of Strafford to Farmer Lynch's short way with the scamps of Virginia there have been many triumphs of justice which are mockeries of law.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="native.c31.p24"><s sid="68" id="native.c31.s68">About half a mile below Clym's secluded dwelling lay a hamlet where lived one of the two constables who preserved the peace in the parish of Alderworth, and Wildeve went straight to the constable's cottage.</s> <s sid="69" id="native.c31.s69">Almost the first thing that he saw on opening the door was the constable's truncheon hanging to a nail, as if to assure him that here were the means to his purpose.</s> <s sid="70" id="native.c31.s70">On inquiry, however, of the constable's wife he learnt that the constable was not at home.</s> <s sid="71" id="native.c31.s71">Wildeve said he would wait.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="native.c31.p26" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="native.c31.s76">Thus far the reddleman had been tolerably successful in his rude contrivances for keeping down Wildeve's inclination to rove in the evening.</s> <s sid="77" id="native.c31.s77">He had nipped in the bud the possible meeting between Eustacia and her old lover this very night.</s> <s sid="78" id="native.c31.s78">But he had not anticipated that the tendency of his action would be to divert Wildeve's movement rather than to stop it.</s> <s sid="79" id="native.c31.s79">The gambling with the guineas had not conduced to make him a welcome guest to Clym; but to call upon his wife's relative was natural, and he was determined to see Eustacia.</s> <s sid="80" id="native.c31.s80">It was necessary to choose some less untoward hour than ten o'clock at night.</s> <s sid="81" id="native.c31.s81"><qs/>"Since it is unsafe to go in the evening,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"I'll go by day."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="native.c31.p28" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="native.c31.s84">He gave her a full account of Clym's affliction, and of the state in which he was living; then, referring to Thomasin, touched gently upon the apparent sadness of her days.</s> <s sid="85" id="native.c31.s85"><qs/>"Now, ma'am, depend upon it,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"you couldn't do a better thing for either of 'em than to make yourself at home in their houses, even if there should be a little rebuff at first."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="native.c44.p1"><s sid="1" id="native.c44.s1">Having seen Eustacia's signal from the hill at eight o'clock, Wildeve immediately prepared to assist her in her flight, and, as he hoped, accompany her.</s> <s sid="2" id="native.c44.s2">He was somewhat perturbed, and his manner of informing Thomasin that he was going on a journey was in itself sufficient to rouse her suspicions.</s> <s sid="3" id="native.c44.s3">When she had gone to bed he collected the few articles he would require, and went upstairs to the money-chest, whence he took a tolerably bountiful sum in notes, which had been advanced to him on the property he was so soon to have in possession, to defray expenses incidental to the removal.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="native.c44.p2"><s sid="4" id="native.c44.s4">He then went to the stable and coach-house to assure himself that the horse, gig, and harness were in a fit condition for a long drive.</s> <s sid="5" id="native.c44.s5">Nearly half an hour was spent thus, and on returning to the house Wildeve had no thought of Thomasin being anywhere but in bed.</s> <s sid="6" id="native.c44.s6">He had told the stable-lad not to stay up, leading the boy to understand that his departure would be at three or four in the morning; for this, though an exceptional hour, was less strange than midnight, the time actually agreed on, the packet from Budmouth sailing between one and two.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="native.c44.p3"><s sid="7" id="native.c44.s7">At last all was quiet, and he had nothing to do but to wait.</s> <s sid="8" id="native.c44.s8">By no effort could he shake off the oppression of spirits which he had experienced ever since his last meeting with Eustacia, but he hoped there was that in his situation which money could cure.</s> <s sid="9" id="native.c44.s9">He had persuaded himself that to act not ungenerously towards his gentle wife by settling on her the half of his property, and with chivalrous devotion towards another and greater woman by sharing her fate, was possible.</s> <s sid="10" id="native.c44.s10">And though he meant to adhere to Eustacia's instructions to the letter, to deposit her where she wished and to leave her, should that be her will, the spell that she had cast over him intensified, and his heart was beating fast in the anticipated futility of such commands in the face of a mutual wish that they should throw in their lot together.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="native.c44.p4"><s sid="11" id="native.c44.s11">He would not allow himself to dwell long upon these conjectures, maxims, and hopes, and at twenty minutes to twelve he again went softly to the stable, harnessed the horse, and lit the lamps; whence, taking the horse by the head, he led him with the covered car out of the yard to a spot by the roadside some quarter of a mile below the inn.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="native.c44.p5"><s sid="12" id="native.c44.s12">Here Wildeve waited, slightly sheltered from the driving rain by a high bank that had been cast up at this place.</s> <s sid="13" id="native.c44.s13">Along the surface of the road where lit by the lamps the loosened gravel and small stones scudded and clicked together before the wind, which, leaving them in heaps, plunged into the heath and boomed across the bushes into darkness.</s> <s sid="14" id="native.c44.s14">Only one sound rose above this din of weather, and that was the roaring of a ten-hatch weir to the southward, from a river in the meads which formed the boundary of the heath in this direction.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="native.c44.p8"><s sid="22" id="native.c44.s22">At this moment a footstep approached; but the light of the lamps being in a different direction the comer was not visible.</s> <s sid="23" id="native.c44.s23">The step paused, then came on again.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="native.c44.p10"><s sid="25" id="native.c44.s25">The person came forward, and the light fell upon the form of Clym, glistening with wet, whom Wildeve immediately recognized; but Wildeve, who stood behind the lamp, was not at once recognized by Yeobright.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="native.c44.p11"><s sid="26" id="native.c44.s26">He stopped as if in doubt whether this waiting vehicle could have anything to do with the flight of his wife or not.</s> <s sid="27" id="native.c44.s27">The sight of Yeobright at once banished Wildeve's sober feelings, who saw him again as the deadly rival from whom Eustacia was to be kept at all hazards.</s> <s sid="28" id="native.c44.s28">Hence Wildeve did not speak, in the hope that Clym would pass by without particular inquiry.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="native.c44.p13" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="native.c44.s31">Both started.</s> <s sid="32" id="native.c44.s32"><qs/>"Good God! can it be she?"<qe/> said Clym.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="native.c44.p14" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="native.c44.s33"><qs/>"Why should it be she?"<qe/> said Wildeve, in his alarm forgetting that he had hitherto screened himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="native.c44.p16"><s sid="39" id="native.c44.s39">Yeobright seized the one on his side and hastened on; Wildeve did not wait to unfasten the other, but followed at once along the meadow-track to the weir, a little in the rear of Clym.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="native.c44.p17"><s sid="40" id="native.c44.s40">Shadwater Weir had at its foot a large circular pool, fifty feet in diameter, into which the water flowed through ten huge hatches, raised and lowered by a winch and cogs in the ordinary manner.</s> <s sid="41" id="native.c44.s41">The sides of the pool were of masonry, to prevent the water from washing away the bank; but the force of the stream in winter was sometimes such as to undermine the retaining wall and precipitate it into the hole.</s> <s sid="42" id="native.c44.s42">Clym reached the hatches, the framework of which was shaken to its foundations by the velocity of the current.</s> <s sid="43" id="native.c44.s43">Nothing but the froth of the waves could be discerned in the pool below.</s> <s sid="44" id="native.c44.s44">He got upon the plank bridge over the race, and holding to the rail, that the wind might not blow him off, crossed to the other side of the river.</s> <s sid="45" id="native.c44.s45">There he leant over the wall and lowered the lamp, only to behold the vortex formed at the curl of the returning current.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="native.c44.p18"><s sid="46" id="native.c44.s46">Wildeve meanwhile had arrived on the former side, and the light from Yeobright's lamp shed a flecked and agitated radiance across the weir pool, revealing to the ex-engineer the tumbling courses of the currents from the hatches above.</s> <s sid="47" id="native.c44.s47">Across this gashed and puckered mirror a dark body was slowly borne by one of the backward currents.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="native.c44.p19" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="native.c44.s48"><qs/>"O, my darling!"<qe/> exclaimed Wildeve in an agonized voice; and, without showing sufficient presence of mind even to throw off his greatcoat, he leaped into the boiling caldron.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="native.c44.p20"><s sid="49" id="native.c44.s49">Yeobright could now also discern the floating body, though but indistinctly; and imagining from Wildeve's plunge that there was life to be saved he was about to leap after.</s> <s sid="50" id="native.c44.s50">Bethinking himself of a wiser plan he placed the lamp against a post to make it stand upright, and running round to the lower part of the pool, where there was no wall, he sprang in and boldly waded upwards towards the deeper portion.</s> <s sid="51" id="native.c44.s51">Here he was taken off his legs, and in swimming was carried round into the centre of the basin, where he perceived Wildeve struggling.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="native.c44.p21"><s sid="52" id="native.c44.s52">While these hasty actions were in progress here, Venn and Thomasin had been toiling through the lower corner of the heath in the direction of the light.</s> <s sid="53" id="native.c44.s53">They had not been near enough to the river to hear the plunge, but they saw the removal of the carriage-lamp, and watched its motion into the mead.</s> <s sid="54" id="native.c44.s54">As soon as they reached the car and horse Venn guessed that something new was amiss, and hastened to follow in the course of the moving light.</s> <s sid="55" id="native.c44.s55">Venn walked faster than Thomasin, and came to the weir alone.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="native.c44.p22"><s sid="56" id="native.c44.s56">The lamp placed against the post by Clym still shone across the water, and the reddleman observed something floating motionless.</s> <s sid="57" id="native.c44.s57">Being encumbered with the infant, he ran back to meet Thomasin.</s> </p>

<title>I The Inevitable Movement Onward</title>

<p pid="1" id="native.c45.p1"><s sid="1" id="native.c45.s1">The story of the deaths of Eustacia and Wildeve was told throughout Egdon, and far beyond, for many weeks and months.</s> <s sid="2" id="native.c45.s2">All the known incidents of their love were enlarged, distorted, touched up, and modified, till the original reality bore but a slight resemblance to the counterfeit presentation by surrounding tongues.</s> <s sid="3" id="native.c45.s3">Yet, upon the whole, neither the man nor the woman lost dignity by sudden death.</s> <s sid="4" id="native.c45.s4">Misfortune had struck them gracefully, cutting off their erratic histories with a catastrophic dash, instead of, as with many, attenuating each life to an uninteresting meagreness, through long years of wrinkles, neglect, and decay.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="native.c45.p2"><s sid="5" id="native.c45.s5">On those most nearly concerned the effect was somewhat different.</s> <s sid="6" id="native.c45.s6">Strangers who had heard of many such cases now merely heard of one more; but immediately where a blow falls no previous imaginings amount to appreciable preparation for it.</s> <s sid="7" id="native.c45.s7">The very suddenness of her bereavement dulled, to some extent, Thomasin's feelings; yet, irrationally enough, a consciousness that the husband she had lost ought to have been a better man did not lessen her mourning at all.</s> <s sid="8" id="native.c45.s8">On the contrary, this fact seemed at first to set off the dead husband in his young wife's eyes, and to be the necessary cloud to the rainbow.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="native.c45.p3"><s sid="9" id="native.c45.s9">But the horrors of the unknown had passed.</s> <s sid="10" id="native.c45.s10">Vague misgivings about her future as a deserted wife were at an end.</s> <s sid="11" id="native.c45.s11">The worst had once been matter of trembling conjecture; it was now matter of reason only, a limited badness.</s> <s sid="12" id="native.c45.s12">Her chief interest, the little Eustacia, still remained.</s> <s sid="13" id="native.c45.s13">There was humility in her grief, no defiance in her attitude; and when this is the case a shaken spirit is apt to be stilled.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="native.c45.p4"><s sid="14" id="native.c45.s14">Could Thomasin's mournfulness now and Eustacia's serenity during life have been reduced to common measure, they would have touched the same mark nearly.</s> <s sid="15" id="native.c45.s15">But Thomasin's former brightness made shadow of that which in a sombre atmosphere was light itself.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="native.c45.p5"><s sid="16" id="native.c45.s16">The spring came and calmed her; the summer came and soothed her; the autumn arrived, and she began to be comforted, for her little girl was strong and happy, growing in size and knowledge every day.</s> <s sid="17" id="native.c45.s17">Outward events flattered Thomasin not a little.</s> <s sid="18" id="native.c45.s18">Wildeve had died intestate, and she and the child were his only relatives.</s> <s sid="19" id="native.c45.s19">When administration had been granted, all the debts paid, and the residue of her husband's uncle's property had come into her hands, it was found that the sum waiting to be invested for her own and the child's benefit was little less than ten thousand pounds.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="native.c45.p6"><s sid="20" id="native.c45.s20">Where should she live?</s> <s sid="21" id="native.c45.s21">The obvious place was Blooms-End.</s> <s sid="22" id="native.c45.s22">The old rooms, it is true, were not much higher than the between-decks of a frigate, necessitating a sinking in the floor under the new clock-case she brought from the inn, and the removal of the handsome brass knobs on its head, before there was height for it to stand; but, such as the rooms were, there were plenty of them, and the place was endeared to her by every early recollection.</s> <s sid="23" id="native.c45.s23">Clym very gladly admitted her as a tenant, confining his own existence to two rooms at the top of the back staircase, where he lived on quietly, shut off from Thomasin and the three servants she had thought fit to indulge in now that she was a mistress of money, going his own ways, and thinking his own thoughts.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="native.c45.p7"><s sid="24" id="native.c45.s24">His sorrows had made some change in his outward appearance; and yet the alteration was chiefly within.</s> <s sid="25" id="native.c45.s25">It might have been said that he had a wrinkled mind.</s> <s sid="26" id="native.c45.s26">He had no enemies, and he could get nobody to reproach him, which was why he so bitterly reproached himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="native.c45.p8"><s sid="27" id="native.c45.s27">He did sometimes think he had been ill-used by fortune, so far as to say that to be born is a palpable dilemma, and that instead of men aiming to advance in life with glory they should calculate how to retreat out of it without shame.</s> <s sid="28" id="native.c45.s28">But that he and his had been sarcastically and pitilessly handled in having such irons thrust into their souls he did not maintain long.</s> <s sid="29" id="native.c45.s29">It is usually so, except with the sternest of men.</s> <s sid="30" id="native.c45.s30">Human beings, in their generous endeavour to construct a hypothesis that shall not degrade a First Cause, have always hesitated to conceive a dominant power of lower moral quality than their own; and, even while they sit down and weep by the waters of Babylon, invent excuses for the oppression which prompts their tears.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="native.c45.p9"><s sid="31" id="native.c45.s31">Thus, though words of solace were vainly uttered in his presence, he found relief in a direction of his own choosing when left to himself.</s> <s sid="32" id="native.c45.s32">For a man of his habits the house and the hundred and twenty pounds a year which he had inherited from his mother were enough to supply all worldly needs.</s> <s sid="33" id="native.c45.s33">Resources do not depend upon gross amounts, but upon the proportion of spendings to takings.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="native.c45.p10"><s sid="34" id="native.c45.s34">He frequently walked the heath alone, when the past seized upon him with its shadowy hand, and held him there to listen to its tale.</s> <s sid="35" id="native.c45.s35">His imagination would then people the spot with its ancient inhabitants: forgotten Celtic tribes trod their tracks about him, and he could almost live among them, look in their faces, and see them standing beside the barrows which swelled around, untouched and perfect as at the time of their erection.</s> <s sid="36" id="native.c45.s36">Those of the dyed barbarians who had chosen the cultivable tracts were, in comparison with those who had left their marks here, as writers on paper beside writers on parchment.</s> <s sid="37" id="native.c45.s37">Their records had perished long ago by the plough, while the works of these remained.</s> <s sid="38" id="native.c45.s38">Yet they all had lived and died unconscious of the different fates awaiting their relics.</s> <s sid="39" id="native.c45.s39">It reminded him that unforeseen factors operate in the evolution of immortality.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="native.c45.p11"><s sid="40" id="native.c45.s40">Winter again came round, with its winds, frosts, tame robins, and sparkling starlight.</s> <s sid="41" id="native.c45.s41">The year previous Thomasin had hardly been conscious of the season's advance; this year she laid her heart open to external influences of every kind.</s> <s sid="42" id="native.c45.s42">The life of this sweet cousin, her baby, and her servants, came to Clym's senses only in the form of sounds through a wood partition as he sat over books of exceptionally large type; but his ear became at last so accustomed to these slight noises from the other part of the house that he almost could witness the scenes they signified.</s> <s sid="43" id="native.c45.s43">A faint beat of half-seconds conjured up Thomasin rocking the cradle, a wavering hum meant that she was singing the baby to sleep, a crunching of sand as between millstones raised the picture of Humphrey's, Fairway's, or Sam's heavy feet crossing the stone floor of the kitchen; a light boyish step, and a gay tune in a high key, betokened a visit from Grandfer Cantle; a sudden break-off in the Grandfer's utterances implied the application to his lips of a mug of small beer, a bustling and slamming of doors meant starting to go to market; for Thomasin, in spite of her added scope of gentility, led a ludicrously narrow life, to the end that she might save every possible pound for her little daughter.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="native.c45.p12"><s sid="44" id="native.c45.s44">One summer day Clym was in the garden, immediately outside the parlour window, which was as usual open.</s> <s sid="45" id="native.c45.s45">He was looking at the pot-flowers on the sill; they had been revived and restored by Thomasin to the state in which his mother had left them.</s> <s sid="46" id="native.c45.s46">He heard a slight scream from Thomasin, who was sitting inside the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="native.c45.p13" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="native.c45.s47"><qs/>"O, how you frightened me!"<qe/> she said to some one who had entered.</s> <s sid="48" id="native.c45.s48"><qs/>"I thought you were the ghost of yourself."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="native.c45.p14"><s sid="49" id="native.c45.s49">Clym was curious enough to advance a little further and look in at the window.</s> <s sid="50" id="native.c45.s50">To his astonishment there stood within the room Diggory Venn, no longer a reddleman, but exhibiting the strangely altered hues of an ordinary Christian countenance, white shirt-front, light flowered waistcoat, blue-spotted neckerchief, and bottle-green coat.</s> <s sid="51" id="native.c45.s51">Nothing in this appearance was at all singular but the fact of its great difference from what he had formerly been.</s> <s sid="52" id="native.c45.s52">Red, and all approach to red, was carefully excluded from every article of clothes upon him; for what is there that persons just out of harness dread so much as reminders of the trade which has enriched them?</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="native.c45.p15"><s sid="53" id="native.c45.s53">Yeobright went round to the door and entered.</s> </p>
