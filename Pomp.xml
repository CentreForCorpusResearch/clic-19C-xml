<p pid="3" id="Pomp.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="Pomp.c1.s4"><qs/>'Alas, no! dear Clodius; he has not invited me,'<qe/> replied Diomed, a man of portly frame and of middle age.</s> <s sid="5" id="Pomp.c1.s5">'By Pollux, a scurvy trick! for they say his suppers are the best in Pompeii'.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Pomp.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="Pomp.c1.s22"><qs/>'An ostentatious, bustling, ill-bred fellow,'<qe/> muttered Clodius to himself, as he sauntered slowly away.</s> <s sid="23" id="Pomp.c1.s23"><qs/>'He thinks with his feasts and his wine-cellars to make us forget that he is the son of a freedman--and so we will, when we do him the honour of winning his money; these rich plebeians are a harvest for us spendthrift nobles.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Pomp.c1.p15"><s sid="24" id="Pomp.c1.s24">Thus soliloquising, Clodius arrived in the Via Domitiana, which was crowded with passengers and chariots, and exhibited all that gay and animated exuberance of life and motion which we find at this day in the streets of Naples.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Pomp.c1.p16"><s sid="25" id="Pomp.c1.s25">The bells of the cars as they rapidly glided by each other jingled merrily on the ear, and Clodius with smiles or nods claimed familiar acquaintance with whatever equipage was most elegant or fantastic: in fact, no idler was better known in Pompeii.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Pomp.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="Pomp.c1.s26"><qs/>'What, Clodius! and how have you slept on your good fortune?'<qe/> cried, in a pleasant and musical voice, a young man, in a chariot of the most fastidious and graceful fashion.</s> <s sid="27" id="Pomp.c1.s27">Upon its surface of bronze were elaborately wrought, in the still exquisite workmanship of Greece, reliefs of the Olympian games; the two horses that drew the car were of the rarest breed of Parthia; their slender limbs seemed to disdain the ground and court the air, and yet at the slightest touch of the charioteer, who stood behind the young owner of the equipage, they paused motionless, as if suddenly transformed into stone--lifeless, but lifelike, as one of the breathing wonders of Praxiteles.</s> <s sid="28" id="Pomp.c1.s28">The owner himself was of that slender and beautiful symmetry from which the sculptors of Athens drew their models; his Grecian origin betrayed itself in his light but clustering locks, and the perfect harmony of his features.</s> <s sid="29" id="Pomp.c1.s29">He wore no toga, which in the time of the emperors had indeed ceased to be the general distinction of the Romans, and was especially ridiculed by the pretenders to fashion; but his tunic glowed in the richest hues of the Tyrian dye, and the fibulae, or buckles, by which it was fastened, sparkled with emeralds: around his neck was a chain of gold, which in the middle of his breast twisted itself into the form of a serpent's head, from the mouth of which hung pendent a large signet ring of elaborate and most exquisite workmanship; the sleeves of the tunic were loose, and fringed at the hand with gold: and across the waist a girdle wrought in arabesque designs, and of the same material as the fringe, served in lieu of pockets for the receptacle of the handkerchief and the purse, the stilus and the tablets.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="Pomp.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="Pomp.c1.s30"><qs/>'My dear Glaucus!'<qe/><sss/> said Clodius, <sse/><qs/>'I rejoice to see that your losses have so little affected your mien.</s> <s sid="31" id="Pomp.c1.s31">Why, you seem as if you had been inspired by Apollo, and your face shines with happiness like a glory; any one might take you for the winner, and me for the loser.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="Pomp.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="Pomp.c1.s32"><qs/>'And what is there in the loss or gain of those dull pieces of metal that should change our spirit, my Clodius?</s> <s sid="33" id="Pomp.c1.s33">By Venus, while yet young, we can cover our full locks with chaplets--while yet the cithara sounds on unsated ears--while yet the smile of Lydia or of Chloe flashes over our veins in which the blood runs so swiftly, so long shall we find delight in the sunny air, and make bald time itself but the treasurer of our joys.</s> <s sid="34" id="Pomp.c1.s34">You sup with me to-night, you know.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="Pomp.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="Pomp.c1.s35"><qs/>'Who ever forgets the invitation of Glaucus!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="Pomp.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="Pomp.c1.s36"><qs/>'But which way go you now?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="Pomp.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="Pomp.c1.s37"><qs/>'Why, I thought of visiting the baths: but it wants yet an hour to the usual time.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="Pomp.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="Pomp.c1.s38"><qs/>'Well, I will dismiss my chariot, and go with you.</s> <s sid="39" id="Pomp.c1.s39">So, so, my Phylias,'<qe/> stroking the horse nearest to him, which by a low neigh and with backward ears playfully acknowledged the courtesy:</s> <s sid="40" id="Pomp.c1.s40"><qs/>'a holiday for you to-day.</s> <s sid="41" id="Pomp.c1.s41">Is he not handsome, Clodius?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="Pomp.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="Pomp.c1.s42"><qs/>'Worthy of Phoebus,'<qe/><sss/> returned the noble parasite--<sse/><qs/>'or of Glaucus.'<qe/></s> </p></div>

<p pid="6" id="Pomp.c3.p6"><s sid="17" id="Pomp.c3.s17">In this hall (or atrium, to speak classically) the clients and visitors of inferior rank were usually received.</s> <s sid="18" id="Pomp.c3.s18">In the houses of the more 'respectable', an atriensis, or slave peculiarly devoted to the service of the hall, was invariably retained, and his rank among his fellow-slaves was high and important.</s> <s sid="19" id="Pomp.c3.s19">The reservoir in the centre must have been rather a dangerous ornament, but the centre of the hall was like the grass-plot of a college, and interdicted to the passers to and fro, who found ample space in the margin.</s> <s sid="20" id="Pomp.c3.s20">Right opposite the entrance, at the other end of the hall, was an apartment (tablinum), in which the pavement was usually adorned with rich mosaics, and the walls covered with elaborate paintings.</s> <s sid="21" id="Pomp.c3.s21">Here were usually kept the records of the family, or those of any public office that had been filled by the owner: on one side of this saloon, if we may so call it, was often a dining-room, or triclinium; on the other side, perhaps, what we should now term a cabinet of gems, containing whatever curiosities were deemed most rare and costly; and invariably a small passage for the slaves to cross to the further parts of the house, without passing the apartments thus mentioned.</s> <s sid="22" id="Pomp.c3.s22">These rooms all opened on a square or oblong colonnade, technically termed peristyle.</s> <s sid="23" id="Pomp.c3.s23">If the house was small, its boundary ceased with this colonnade; and in that case its centre, however diminutive, was ordinarily appropriated to the purpose of a garden, and adorned with vases of flowers, placed upon pedestals: while, under the colonnade, to the right and left, were doors admitting to bedrooms, to a second triclinium, or eating-room (for the ancients generally appropriated two rooms at least to that purpose, one for summer, and one for winter--or, perhaps, one for ordinary, the other for festive, occasions); and if the owner affected letters, a cabinet, dignified by the name of library--for a very small room was sufficient to contain the few rolls of papyrus which the ancients deemed a notable collection of books.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Pomp.c3.p7"><s sid="24" id="Pomp.c3.s24">At the end of the peristyle was generally the kitchen.</s> <s sid="25" id="Pomp.c3.s25">Supposing the house was large, it did not end with the peristyle, and the centre thereof was not in that case a garden, but might be, perhaps, adorned with a fountain, or basin for fish; and at its end, exactly opposite to the tablinum, was generally another eating-room, on either side of which were bedrooms, and, perhaps, a picture-saloon, or pinacotheca.</s> <s sid="26" id="Pomp.c3.s26">These apartments communicated again with a square or oblong space, usually adorned on three sides with a colonnade like the peristyle, and very much resembling the peristyle, only usually longer.</s> <s sid="27" id="Pomp.c3.s27">This was the proper viridarium, or garden, being commonly adorned with a fountain, or statues, and a profusion of gay flowers: at its extreme end was the gardener's house; on either side, beneath the colonnade, were sometimes, if the size of the family required it, additional rooms.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Pomp.c3.p8"><s sid="28" id="Pomp.c3.s28">At Pompeii, a second or third story was rarely of importance, being built only above a small part of the house, and containing rooms for the slaves; differing in this respect from the more magnificent edifices of Rome, which generally contained the principal eating-room (or caenaculum) on the second floor.</s> <s sid="29" id="Pomp.c3.s29">The apartments themselves were ordinarily of small size; for in those delightful climes they received any extraordinary number of visitors in the peristyle (or portico), the hall, or the garden; and even their banquet-rooms, however elaborately adorned and carefully selected in point of aspect, were of diminutive proportions; for the intellectual ancients, being fond of society, not of crowds, rarely feasted more than nine at a time, so that large dinner-rooms were not so necessary with them as with us.</s> <s sid="30" id="Pomp.c3.s30">But the suite of rooms seen at once from the entrance, must have had a very imposing effect: you beheld at once the hall richly paved and painted--the tablinum--the graceful peristyle, and (if the house extended farther) the opposite banquet-room and the garden, which closed the view with some gushing fount or marble statue.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Pomp.c3.p9"><s sid="31" id="Pomp.c3.s31">The reader will now have a tolerable notion of the Pompeian houses, which resembled in some respects the Grecian, but mostly the Roman fashion of domestic architecture.</s> <s sid="32" id="Pomp.c3.s32">In almost every house there is some difference in detail from the rest, but the principal outline is the same in all.</s> <s sid="33" id="Pomp.c3.s33">In all you find the hall, the tablinum, and the peristyle, communicating with each other; in all you find the walls richly painted; and all the evidence of a people fond of the refining elegancies of life.</s> <s sid="34" id="Pomp.c3.s34">The purity of the taste of the Pompeians in decoration is, however, questionable: they were fond of the gaudiest colors, of fantastic designs; they often painted the lower half of their columns a bright red, leaving the rest uncolored; and where the garden was small, its wall was frequently tinted to deceive the eye as to its extent, imitating trees, birds, temples, etc., in perspective--a meretricious delusion which the graceful pedantry of Pliny himself adopted, with a complacent pride in its ingenuity.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Pomp.c3.p10" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="Pomp.c3.s35">But the house of Glaucus was at once one of the smallest, and yet one of the most adorned and finished of all the private mansions of Pompeii: it would be a model at this day for the house of <qs/>'a single man in Mayfair'<qe/>--the envy and despair of the coelibian purchasers of buhl and marquetry.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Pomp.c3.p11" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="Pomp.c3.s36">You enter by a long and narrow vestibule, on the floor of which is the image of a dog in mosaic, with the well-known <qs/>'Cave canem'<qe/>--or 'Beware the dog'.</s> <s sid="37" id="Pomp.c3.s37">On either side is a chamber of some size; for the interior part of the house not being large enough to contain the two great divisions of private and public apartments, these two rooms were set apart for the reception of visitors who neither by rank nor familiarity were entitled to admission in the penetralia of the mansion.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Pomp.c3.p12"><s sid="38" id="Pomp.c3.s38">Advancing up the vestibule you enter an atrium, that when first discovered was rich in paintings, which in point of expression would scarcely disgrace a Rafaele.</s> <s sid="39" id="Pomp.c3.s39">You may see them now transplanted to the Neapolitan Museum: they are still the admiration of connoisseurs--they depict the parting of Achilles and Briseis.</s> <s sid="40" id="Pomp.c3.s40">Who does not acknowledge the force, the vigour, the beauty, employed in delineating the forms and faces of Achilles and the immortal slave!</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="Pomp.c3.p13"><s sid="41" id="Pomp.c3.s41">On one side the atrium, a small staircase admitted to the apartments for the slaves on the second floor; there also were two or three small bedrooms, the walls of which portrayed the rape of Europa, the battle of the Amazons, etc.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Pomp.c3.p14"><s sid="42" id="Pomp.c3.s42">You now enter the tablinum, across which, at either end, hung rich draperies of Tyrian purple, half withdrawn.</s> <s sid="43" id="Pomp.c3.s43">On the walls was depicted a poet reading his verses to his friends; and in the pavement was inserted a small and most exquisite mosaic, typical of the instructions given by the director of the stage to his comedians.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Pomp.c3.p15"><s sid="44" id="Pomp.c3.s44">You passed through this saloon and entered the peristyle; and here (as I have said before was usually the case with the smaller houses of Pompeii) the mansion ended.</s> <s sid="45" id="Pomp.c3.s45">From each of the seven columns that adorned this court hung festoons of garlands: the centre, supplying the place of a garden, bloomed with the rarest flowers placed in vases of white marble, that were supported on pedestals.</s> <s sid="46" id="Pomp.c3.s46">At the left hand of this small garden was a diminutive fane, resembling one of those small chapels placed at the side of roads in Catholic countries, and dedicated to the Penates; before it stood a bronzed tripod: to the left of the colonnade were two small cubicula, or bedrooms; to the right was the triclinium, in which the guests were now assembled.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Pomp.c3.p16"><s sid="47" id="Pomp.c3.s47">This room is usually termed by the antiquaries of Naples 'The Chamber of Leda'; and in the beautiful work of Sir William Gell, the reader will find an engraving from that most delicate and graceful painting of Leda presenting her newborn to her husband, from which the room derives its name.</s> <s sid="48" id="Pomp.c3.s48">This charming apartment opened upon the fragrant garden.</s> <s sid="49" id="Pomp.c3.s49">Round the table of citrean wood, highly polished and delicately wrought with silver arabesques, were placed the three couches, which were yet more common at Pompeii than the semicircular seat that had grown lately into fashion at Rome: and on these couches of bronze, studded with richer metals, were laid thick quiltings covered with elaborate broidery, and yielding luxuriously to the pressure.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Pomp.c9.p2"><s sid="2" id="Pomp.c9.s2">TO one of those parts of Pompeii, which were tenanted not by the lords of pleasure, but by its minions and its victims; the haunt of gladiators and prize-fighters; of the vicious and the penniless; of the savage and the obscene; the Alsatia of an ancient city--we are now transported.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Pomp.c9.p3"><s sid="3" id="Pomp.c9.s3">It was a large room, that opened at once on the confined and crowded lane.</s> <s sid="4" id="Pomp.c9.s4">Before the threshold was a group of men, whose iron and well-strung muscles, whose short and Herculean necks, whose hardy and reckless countenances, indicated the champions of the arena.</s> <s sid="5" id="Pomp.c9.s5">On a shelf, without the shop, were ranged jars of wine and oil; and right over this was inserted in the wall a coarse painting, which exhibited gladiators drinking--so ancient and so venerable is the custom of signs!</s> <s sid="6" id="Pomp.c9.s6">Within the room were placed several small tables, arranged somewhat in the modern fashion of 'boxes', and round these were seated several knots of men, some drinking, some playing at dice, some at that more skilful game called 'duodecim scriptae', which certain of the blundering learned have mistaken for chess, though it rather, perhaps, resembled backgammon of the two, and was usually, though not always, played by the assistance of dice.</s> <s sid="7" id="Pomp.c9.s7">The hour was in the early forenoon, and nothing better, perhaps, than that unseasonable time itself denoted the habitual indolence of these tavern loungers.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Pomp.c9.p4"><s sid="8" id="Pomp.c9.s8">Yet, despite the situation of the house and the character of its inmates, it indicated none of that sordid squalor which would have characterized a similar haunt in a modern city.</s> <s sid="9" id="Pomp.c9.s9">The gay disposition of all the Pompeians, who sought, at least, to gratify the sense even where they neglected the mind, was typified by the gaudy colors which decorated the walls, and the shapes, fantastic but not inelegant, in which the lamps, the drinking-cups, the commonest household utensils, were wrought.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Pomp.c9.p5" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="Pomp.c9.s10"><qs/>'By Pollux!'<qe/><sls/> said one of the gladiators, as he leaned against the wall of the threshold, <sle/><qs/>'the wine thou sellest us, old Silenus'<qe/><sls/>--and as he spoke he slapped a portly personage on the back--<sle/><qs/>'is enough to thin the best blood in one's veins.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Pomp.c9.p6"><s sid="11" id="Pomp.c9.s11">The man thus caressingly saluted, and whose bared arms, white apron, and keys and napkin tucked carelessly within his girdle, indicated him to be the host of the tavern, was already passed into the autumn of his years; but his form was still so robust and athletic, that he might have shamed even the sinewy shapes beside him, save that the muscles had seeded, as it were, into flesh, that the cheeks were swelled and bloated, and the increasing stomach threw into shade the vast and massive chest which rose above it.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Pomp.c9.p7" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="Pomp.c9.s12"><qs/>'None of thy scurrilous blusterings with me,'<qe/><sls/> growled the gigantic landlord, in the gentle semi-roar of an insulted tiger; <sle/><qs/>'my wine is good enough for a carcass which shall so soon soak the dust of the spoliarium.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Pomp.c9.p8" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="Pomp.c9.s13"><qs/>'Croakest thou thus, old raven!'<qe/><sls/> returned the gladiator, laughing scornfully; <sle/><qs/>'thou shalt live to hang thyself with despite when thou seest me win the palm crown; and when I get the purse at the amphitheatre, as I certainly shall, my first vow to Hercules shall be to forswear thee and thy vile potations evermore.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Pomp.c9.p10" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="Pomp.c9.s18"><qs/>'Ha!'<qe/><sls/> said the gladiator, coloring with rising fury, <sle/><qs/>'our lanista would tell a different story.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Pomp.c9.p11" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="Pomp.c9.s19"><qs/>'What story could he tell against me, vain Lydon?'<qe/> said Tetraides, frowning.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Pomp.c9.p12" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="Pomp.c9.s20"><qs/>'Or me, who have conquered in fifteen fights?'<qe/> said the gigantic Niger, stalking up to the gladiator.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="Pomp.c9.p13" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="Pomp.c9.s21"><qs/>'Or me?'<qe/> grunted Sporus, with eyes of fire.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Pomp.c9.p14" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="Pomp.c9.s22"><qs/>'Tush!'<qe/> said Lydon, folding his arms, and regarding his rivals with a reckless air of defiance.</s> <s sid="23" id="Pomp.c9.s23"><qs/>'The time of trial will soon come; keep your valor till then.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Pomp.c9.p15" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="Pomp.c9.s24"><qs/>'Ay, do,'<qe/><sss/> said the surly host; <sse/><qs/>'and if I press down my thumb to save you, may the Fates cut my thread!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Pomp.c9.p16" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="Pomp.c9.s25"><qs/>'Your rope, you mean,'<qe/> said Lydon, sneeringly:</s> <s sid="26" id="Pomp.c9.s26"><qs/>'here is a sesterce to buy one.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Pomp.c9.p17"><s sid="27" id="Pomp.c9.s27">The Titan wine-vender seized the hand extended to him, and griped it in so stern a vice that the blood spirted from the fingers' ends over the garments of the bystanders.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="Pomp.c9.p18"><s sid="28" id="Pomp.c9.s28">They set up a savage laugh.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="Pomp.c9.p19" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="Pomp.c9.s29"><qs/>'I will teach thee, young braggart, to play the Macedonian with me!</s> <s sid="30" id="Pomp.c9.s30">I am no puny Persian, I warrant thee!</s> <s sid="31" id="Pomp.c9.s31">What, man!  have I not fought twenty years in the ring, and never lowered my arms once?</s> <s sid="32" id="Pomp.c9.s32">And have I not received the rod from the editor's own hand as a sign of victory, and as a grace to retirement on my laurels?</s> <s sid="33" id="Pomp.c9.s33">And am I now to be lectured by a boy?'<qe/></s> <s sid="34" id="Pomp.c9.s34">So saying, he flung the hand from him in scorn.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="Pomp.c9.p20"><s sid="35" id="Pomp.c9.s35">Without changing a muscle, but with the same smiling face with which he had previously taunted mine host, did the gladiator brave the painful grasp he had undergone.</s> <s sid="36" id="Pomp.c9.s36">But no sooner was his hand released, than, crouching for one moment as a wild cat crouches, you might see his hair bristle on his head and beard, and with a fierce and shrill yell he sprang on the throat of the giant, with an impetus that threw him, vast and sturdy as he was, from his balance--and down, with the crash of a falling rock, he fell--while over him fell also his ferocious foe.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="Pomp.c9.p21"><s sid="37" id="Pomp.c9.s37">Our host, perhaps, had had no need of the rope so kindly recommended to him by Lydon, had he remained three minutes longer in that position.</s> <s sid="38" id="Pomp.c9.s38">But, summoned to his assistance by the noise of his fall, a woman, who had hitherto kept in an inner apartment, rushed to the scene of battle.</s> <s sid="39" id="Pomp.c9.s39">This new ally was in herself a match for the gladiator; she was tall, lean, and with arms that could give other than soft embraces.</s> <s sid="40" id="Pomp.c9.s40">In fact, the gentle helpmate of Burbo the wine-seller had, like himself, fought in the lists--nay under the emperor's eye.</s> <s sid="41" id="Pomp.c9.s41">And Burbo himself--Burbo, the unconquered in the field, according to report, now and then yielded the palm to his soft Stratonice.</s> <s sid="42" id="Pomp.c9.s42">This sweet creature no sooner saw the imminent peril that awaited her worse half, than without other weapons than those with which Nature had provided her, she darted upon the incumbent gladiator, and, clasping him round the waist with her long and snakelike arms, lifted him by a sudden wrench from the body of her husband, leaving only his hands still clinging to the throat of his foe.</s> <s sid="43" id="Pomp.c9.s43">So have we seen a dog snatched by the hind legs from the strife with a fallen rival in the arms of some envious groom; so have we seen one half of him high in air--passive and offenceless--while the other half, head, teeth, eyes, claws, seemed buried and engulfed in the mangled and prostrate enemy.</s> <s sid="44" id="Pomp.c9.s44">Meanwhile, the gladiators, lapped, and pampered, and glutted upon blood, crowded delightedly round the combatants--their nostrils distended--their lips grinning--their eyes gloatingly fixed on the bloody throat of the one and the indented talons of the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="Pomp.c9.p24" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="Pomp.c9.s48"><qs/>'Fair play!'<qe/> cried the gladiators:</s> <s sid="49" id="Pomp.c9.s49">'one to one'; and, crowding round Lydon and the woman, they separated our pleasing host from his courteous guest.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="Pomp.c9.p25"><s sid="50" id="Pomp.c9.s50">But Lydon, feeling ashamed at his present position, and endeavoring in vain to shake off the grasp of the virago, slipped his hand into his girdle, and drew forth a short knife.</s> <s sid="51" id="Pomp.c9.s51">So menacing was his look, so brightly gleamed the blade, that Stratonice, who was used only to that fashion of battle which we moderns call the pugilistic, started back in alarm.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="Pomp.c9.p26" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="Pomp.c9.s52"><qs/>'O gods!'<qe/><sss/> cried she, <sse/><qs/>'the ruffian!--he has concealed weapons!</s> <s sid="53" id="Pomp.c9.s53">Is that fair?</s> <s sid="54" id="Pomp.c9.s54">Is that like a gentleman and a gladiator?</s> <s sid="55" id="Pomp.c9.s55">No, indeed, I scorn such fellows.'<qe/></s> <s sid="56" id="Pomp.c9.s56">With that she contemptuously turned her back on the gladiator, and hastened to examine the condition of her husband.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="Pomp.c9.p27"><s sid="57" id="Pomp.c9.s57">But he, as much inured to the constitutional exercises as an English bull-dog is to a contest with a more gentle antagonist, had already recovered himself.</s> <s sid="58" id="Pomp.c9.s58">The purple hues receded from the crimson surface of his cheek, the veins of the forehead retired into their wonted size.</s> <s sid="59" id="Pomp.c9.s59">He shook himself with a complacent grunt, satisfied that he was still alive, and then looking at his foe from head to foot with an air of more approbation than he had ever bestowed upon him before:</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="Pomp.c9.p31" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="Pomp.c9.s66"><qs/>'By Hercules!'<qe/><sls/> returned the host, quite unmoved, <sle/><qs/>'that is the true gladiator feeling.</s> <s sid="67" id="Pomp.c9.s67">Pollux! to think what good training may make a man; why, a beast could not be fiercer!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Pomp.c17.p3"><s sid="3" id="Pomp.c17.s3">Their look, with the reach of past ages, was wise, And the soul of eternity thought in their eyes.</s> <s sid="4" id="Pomp.c17.s4">The tall AEthiopian slave grinned as he admitted her, and motioned to her to proceed.</s> <s sid="5" id="Pomp.c17.s5">Half-way up the hall she was met by Arbaces himself, in festive robes, which glittered with jewels.</s> <s sid="6" id="Pomp.c17.s6">Although it was broad day without, the mansion, according to the practice of the luxurious, was artificially darkened, and the lamps cast their still and odor-giving light over the rich floors and ivory roofs.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Pomp.c17.p7"><s sid="11" id="Pomp.c17.s11">He led her through the various chambers of a house, which seemed to contain to her eyes, inexperienced to other splendor than the minute elegance of Campanian cities, the treasures of the world.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Pomp.c17.p8"><s sid="12" id="Pomp.c17.s12">In the walls were set pictures of inestimable art, the lights shone over statues of the noblest age of Greece.</s> <s sid="13" id="Pomp.c17.s13">Cabinets of gems, each cabinet itself a gem, filled up the interstices of the columns; the most precious woods lined the thresholds and composed the doors; gold and jewels seemed lavished all around.</s> <s sid="14" id="Pomp.c17.s14">Sometimes they were alone in these rooms--sometimes they passed through silent rows of slaves, who, kneeling as she passed, proffered to her offerings of bracelets, of chains, of gems, which the Egyptian vainly entreated her to receive.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="Pomp.c17.p13"><s sid="20" id="Pomp.c17.s20">The artful Arbaces sought to dazzle the young Neapolitan by his treasures and his eloquence; he sought to awaken in her the desire to be mistress of what she surveyed: he hoped that she would confound the owner with the possessions, and that the charms of his wealth would be reflected on himself.</s> <s sid="21" id="Pomp.c17.s21">Meanwhile, Ione was secretly somewhat uneasy at the gallantries which escaped from those lips, which, till lately, had seemed to disdain the common homage we pay to beauty; and with that delicate subtlety, which woman alone possesses, she sought to ward off shafts deliberately aimed, and to laugh or to talk away the meaning from his warming language.</s> <s sid="22" id="Pomp.c17.s22">Nothing in the world is more pretty than that same species of defence; it is the charm of the African necromancer who professed with a feather to turn aside the winds.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Pomp.c17.p14"><s sid="23" id="Pomp.c17.s23">The Egyptian was intoxicated and subdued by her grace even more than by her beauty: it was with difficulty that he suppressed his emotions; alas! the feather was only powerful against the summer breezes--it would be the sport of the storm.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Pomp.c17.p15"><s sid="24" id="Pomp.c17.s24">Suddenly, as they stood in one hall, which was surrounded by draperies of silver and white, the Egyptian clapped his hands, and, as if by enchantment, a banquet rose from the floor--a couch or throne, with a crimson canopy, ascended simultaneously at the feet of Ione--and at the same instant from behind the curtains swelled the invisible and softest music.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Pomp.c17.p16"><s sid="25" id="Pomp.c17.s25">Arbaces placed himself at the feet of Ione--and children, young and beautiful as Loves, ministered to the feast.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Pomp.c17.p17"><s sid="26" id="Pomp.c17.s26">The feast was over, the music sank into a low and subdued strain, and Arbaces thus addressed his beautiful guest:</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="Pomp.c17.p21"><s sid="34" id="Pomp.c17.s34">The Neapolitan trembled; she thought of Glaucus, and sighed as well as trembled: were their destinies to be united?</s> <s sid="35" id="Pomp.c17.s35">Half incredulous, half believing, half awed, half alarmed by the words of her strange host, she remained for some moments silent, and then answered:</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="Pomp.c17.p22" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="Pomp.c17.s36"><qs/>'It may revolt--it may terrify; the knowledge of the future will perhaps only embitter the present!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="Pomp.c17.p24"><s sid="40" id="Pomp.c17.s40">Again the heart of Ione murmured 'Glaucus'; she uttered a half-audible assent; the Egyptian rose, and taking her by the hand, he led her across the banquet-room--the curtains withdrew as by magic hands, and the music broke forth in a louder and gladder strain; they passed a row of columns, on either side of which fountains cast aloft their fragrant waters; they descended by broad and easy steps into a garden.</s> <s sid="41" id="Pomp.c17.s41">The eve had commenced; the moon was already high in heaven, and those sweet flowers that sleep by day, and fill, with ineffable odorous, the airs of night, were thickly scattered amidst alleys cut through the star-lit foliage; or, gathered in baskets, lay like offerings at the feet of the frequent statues that gleamed along their path.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="Pomp.c17.p25" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="Pomp.c17.s42"><qs/>'Whither wouldst thou lead me, Arbaces?'<qe/> said Ione, wonderingly.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="Pomp.c17.p27"><s sid="45" id="Pomp.c17.s45">They passed into a narrow hall, at the end of which hung a sable curtain.</s> <s sid="46" id="Pomp.c17.s46">Arbaces lifted it; Ione entered, and found herself in total darkness.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="Pomp.c17.p28" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="Pomp.c17.s47"><qs/>'Be not alarmed,'<qe/><sss/> said the Egyptian, <sse/><qs/>'the light will rise instantly.'<qe/></s> <s sid="48" id="Pomp.c17.s48">While he so spoke, a soft, and warm, and gradual light diffused itself around; as it spread over each object, Ione perceived that she was in an apartment of moderate size, hung everywhere with black; a couch with draperies of the same hue was beside her.</s> <s sid="49" id="Pomp.c17.s49">In the centre of the room was a small altar, on which stood a tripod of bronze.</s> <s sid="50" id="Pomp.c17.s50">At one side, upon a lofty column of granite, was a colossal head of the blackest marble, which she perceived, by the crown of wheat-ears that encircled the brow, represented the great Egyptian goddess.</s> <s sid="51" id="Pomp.c17.s51">Arbaces stood before the altar: he had laid his garland on the shrine, and seemed occupied with pouring into the tripod the contents of a brazen vase; suddenly from that tripod leaped into life a blue, quick, darting, irregular flame; the Egyptian drew back to the side of Ione, and muttered some words in a language unfamiliar to her ear; the curtain at the back of the altar waved tremulously to and fro--it parted slowly, and in the aperture which was thus made, Ione beheld an indistinct and pale landscape, which gradually grew brighter and clearer as she gazed; at length she discovered plainly trees, and rivers, and meadows, and all the beautiful diversity of the richest earth.</s> <s sid="52" id="Pomp.c17.s52">At length, before the landscape, a dim shadow glided; it rested opposite to Ione; slowly the same charm seemed to operate upon it as over the rest of the scene; it took form and shape, and lo!--in its feature and in its form Ione beheld herself!</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="Pomp.c17.p29"><s sid="53" id="Pomp.c17.s53">Then the scene behind the spectre faded away, and was succeeded by the representation of a gorgeous palace; a throne was raised in the centre of its hall, the dim forms of slaves and guards were ranged around it, and a pale hand held over the throne the likeness of a diadem.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="Pomp.c17.p30"><s sid="54" id="Pomp.c17.s54">A new actor now appeared; he was clothed from head to foot in a dark robe--his face was concealed--he knelt at the feet of the shadowy Ione--he clasped her hand--he pointed to the throne, as if to invite her to ascend it.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="Pomp.c17.p31" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="Pomp.c17.s55">The Neapolitan's heart beat violently.</s> <s sid="56" id="Pomp.c17.s56"><qs/>'Shall the shadow disclose itself?'<qe/> whispered a voice beside her--the voice of Arbaces.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="Pomp.c17.p32" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="Pomp.c17.s57"><qs/>'Ah, yes!'<qe/> answered Ione, softly.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="Pomp.c17.p33"><s sid="58" id="Pomp.c17.s58">Arbaces raised his hand--the spectre seemed to drop the mantle that concealed its form--and Ione shrieked--it was Arbaces himself that thus knelt before her.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Pomp.c18.p2"><s sid="2" id="Pomp.c18.s2">IT was early noon, and the forum was crowded alike with the busy and the idle.</s> <s sid="3" id="Pomp.c18.s3">As at Paris at this day, so at that time in the cities of Italy, men lived almost wholly out of doors: the public buildings, the forum, the porticoes, the baths, the temples themselves, might be considered their real homes; it was no wonder that they decorated so gorgeously these favorite places of resort--they felt for them a sort of domestic affection as well as a public pride.</s> <s sid="4" id="Pomp.c18.s4">And animated was, indeed, the aspect of the forum of Pompeii at that time!</s> <s sid="5" id="Pomp.c18.s5">Along its broad pavement, composed of large flags of marble, were assembled various groups, conversing in that energetic fashion which appropriates a gesture to every word, and which is still the characteristic of the people of the south.</s> <s sid="6" id="Pomp.c18.s6">Here, in seven stalls on one side the colonnade, sat the money-changers, with their glittering heaps before them, and merchants and seamen in various costumes crowding round their stalls.</s> <s sid="7" id="Pomp.c18.s7">On one side, several men in long togas were seen bustling rapidly up to a stately edifice, where the magistrates administered justice--these were the lawyers, active, chattering, joking, and punning, as you may find them at this day in Westminster.</s> <s sid="8" id="Pomp.c18.s8">In the centre of the space, pedestals supported various statues, of which the most remarkable was the stately form of Cicero.</s> <s sid="9" id="Pomp.c18.s9">Around the court ran a regular and symmetrical colonnade of Doric architecture; and there several, whose business drew them early to the place, were taking the slight morning repast which made an Italian breakfast, talking vehemently on the earthquake of the preceding night as they dipped pieces of bread in their cups of diluted wine.</s> <s sid="10" id="Pomp.c18.s10">In the open space, too, you might perceive various petty traders exercising the arts of their calling.</s> <s sid="11" id="Pomp.c18.s11">Here one man was holding out ribands to a fair dame from the country; another man was vaunting to a stout farmer the excellence of his shoes; a third, a kind of stall-restaurateur, still so common in the Italian cities, was supplying many a hungry mouth with hot messes from his small and itinerant stove, while--contrast strongly typical of the mingled bustle and intellect of the time--close by, a schoolmaster was expounding to his puzzled pupils the elements of the Latin grammar.'</s> <s sid="12" id="Pomp.c18.s12">A gallery above the portico, which was ascended by small wooden staircases, had also its throng; though, as here the immediate business of the place was mainly carried on, its groups wore a more quiet and serious air.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Pomp.c18.p3"><s sid="13" id="Pomp.c18.s13">Every now and then the crowd below respectfully gave way as some senator swept along to the Temple of Jupiter (which filled up one side of the forum, and was the senators' hall of meeting), nodding with ostentatious condescension to such of his friends or clients as he distinguished amongst the throng.</s> <s sid="14" id="Pomp.c18.s14">Mingling amidst the gay dresses of the better orders you saw the hardy forms of the neighboring farmers, as they made their way to the public granaries.</s> <s sid="15" id="Pomp.c18.s15">Hard by the temple you caught a view of the triumphal arch, and the long street beyond swarming with inhabitants; in one of the niches of the arch a fountain played, cheerily sparkling in the sunbeams; and above its cornice rose the bronzed and equestrian statue of Caligula, strongly contrasting the gay summer skies.</s> <s sid="16" id="Pomp.c18.s16">Behind the stalls of the money-changers was that building now called the Pantheon; and a crowd of the poorer Pompeians passed through the small vestibule which admitted to the interior, with panniers under their arms, pressing on towards a platform, placed between two columns, where such provisions as the priests had rescued from sacrifice were exposed for sale.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Pomp.c18.p4"><s sid="17" id="Pomp.c18.s17">At one of the public edifices appropriated to the business of the city, workmen were employed upon the columns, and you heard the noise of their labor every now and then rising above the hum of the multitude: the columns are unfinished to this day!</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Pomp.c18.p5"><s sid="18" id="Pomp.c18.s18">All, then, united, nothing could exceed in variety the costumes, the ranks, the manners, the occupations of the crowd--nothing could exceed the bustle, the gaiety, the animation--where pleasure and commerce, idleness and labor, avarice and ambition, mingled in one gulf their motley rushing, yet harmonius, streams.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Pomp.c18.p6"><s sid="19" id="Pomp.c18.s19">Facing the steps of the Temple of Jupiter, with folded arms, and a knit and contemptuous brow, stood a man of about fifty years of age.</s> <s sid="20" id="Pomp.c18.s20">His dress was remarkably plain--not so much from its material, as from the absence of all those ornaments which were worn by the Pompeians of every rank--partly from the love of show, partly, also, because they were chiefly wrought into those shapes deemed most efficacious in resisting the assaults of magic and the influence of the evil eye.</s> <s sid="21" id="Pomp.c18.s21">His forehead was high and bald; the few locks that remained at the back of the head were concealed by a sort of cowl, which made a part of his cloak, to be raised or lowered at pleasure, and was now drawn half-way over the head, as a protection from the rays of the sun.</s> <s sid="22" id="Pomp.c18.s22">The color of his garments was brown, no popular hue with the Pompeians; all the usual admixtures of scarlet or purple seemed carefully excluded.</s> <s sid="23" id="Pomp.c18.s23">His belt, or girdle, contained a small receptacle for ink, which hooked on to the girdle, a stilus (or implement of writing), and tablets of no ordinary size.</s> <s sid="24" id="Pomp.c18.s24">What was rather remarkable, the cincture held no purse, which was the almost indispensable appurtenance of the girdle, even when that purse had the misfortune to be empty!</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Pomp.c18.p7"><s sid="25" id="Pomp.c18.s25">It was not often that the gay and egotistical Pompeians busied themselves with observing the countenances and actions of their neighbors; but there was that in the lip and eye of this bystander so remarkably bitter and disdainful, as he surveyed the religious procession sweeping up the stairs of the temple, that it could not fail to arrest the notice of many.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Pomp.c18.p14" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="Pomp.c18.s44">While such were the friendly remarks provoked by the air and faith of the Nazarene, Olinthus himself became sensible of the effect he was producing; he turned his eyes round, and observed the intent faces of the accumulating throng, whispering as they gazed; and surveying them for a moment with an expression, first of defiance and afterwards of compassion, he gathered his cloak round him and passed on, muttering audibly, <qs/>'Deluded idolaters!--did not last night's convulsion warn ye?</s> <s sid="45" id="Pomp.c18.s45">Alas! how will ye meet the last day?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Pomp.c18.p15"><s sid="46" id="Pomp.c18.s46">The crowd that heard these boding words gave them different interpretations, according to their different shades of ignorance and of fear; all, however, concurred in imagining them to convey some awful imprecation.</s> <s sid="47" id="Pomp.c18.s47">They regarded the Christian as the enemy of mankind; the epithets they lavished upon him, of which 'Atheist' was the most favored and frequent, may serve, perhaps, to warn us, believers of that same creed now triumphant, how we indulge the persecution of opinion Olinthus then underwent, and how we apply to those whose notions differ from our own the terms at that day lavished on the fathers of our faith.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Pomp.c18.p16"><s sid="48" id="Pomp.c18.s48">As Olinthus stalked through the crowd, and gained one of the more private places of egress from the forum, he perceived gazing upon him a pale and earnest countenance, which he was not slow to recognize.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Pomp.c18.p17"><s sid="49" id="Pomp.c18.s49">Wrapped in a pallium that partially concealed his sacred robes, the young Apaecides surveyed the disciple of that new and mysterious creed, to which at one time he had been half a convert.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="Pomp.c18.p19"><s sid="53" id="Pomp.c18.s53">Olinthus, accustomed to men of all classes, and combining with the enthusiasm of his faith a profound experience of his kind, guessed, perhaps, by the index of the countenance, something of what passed within the breast of the priest.</s> <s sid="54" id="Pomp.c18.s54">He met the survey of Apaecides with a steady eye, and a brow of serene and open candour.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="Pomp.c26.p20"><s sid="47" id="Pomp.c26.s47">Our lovers stopped in perplexity and doubt, when suddenly, as the darkness that gloomed between the fierce flashes of lightning once more wrapped them round, they saw near, but high, before them, the mysterious light.</s> <s sid="48" id="Pomp.c26.s48">Another blaze, in which heaven and earth were reddened, made visible to them the whole expanse; no house was near, but just where they had beheld the light, they thought they saw in the recess of the cavern the outline of a human form.</s> <s sid="49" id="Pomp.c26.s49">The darkness once more returned; the light, no longer paled beneath the fires of heaven, burned forth again: they resolved to ascend towards it; they had to wind their way among vast fragments of stone, here and there overhung with wild bushes; but they gained nearer and nearer to the light, and at length they stood opposite the mouth of a kind of cavern, apparently formed by huge splinters of rock that had fallen transversely athwart each other: and, looking into the gloom, each drew back involuntarily with a superstitious fear and chill.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="Pomp.c26.p21"><s sid="50" id="Pomp.c26.s50">A fire burned in the far recess of the cave; and over it was a small cauldron; on a tall and thin column of iron stood a rude lamp; over that part of the wall, at the base of which burned the fire, hung in many rows, as if to dry, a profusion of herbs and weeds.</s> <s sid="51" id="Pomp.c26.s51">A fox, couched before the fire, gazed upon the strangers with its bright and red eye--its hair bristling--and a low growl stealing from between its teeth; in the centre of the cave was an earthen statue, which had three heads of a singular and fantastic cast: they were formed by the real skulls of a dog, a horse, and a boar; a low tripod stood before this wild representation of the popular Hecate.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Pomp.c29.p2"><s sid="3" id="Pomp.c29.s3">WHOEVER regards the early history of Christianity, will perceive how necessary to its triumph was that fierce spirit of zeal, which, fearing no danger, accepting no compromise, inspired its champions and sustained its martyrs.</s> <s sid="4" id="Pomp.c29.s4">In a dominant Church the genius of intolerance betrays its cause--in a weak and persecuted Church, the same genius mainly supports.</s> <s sid="5" id="Pomp.c29.s5">It was necessary to scorn, to loathe, to abhor the creeds of other men, in order to conquer the temptations which they presented--it was necessary rigidly to believe not only that the Gospel was the true faith, but the sole true faith that saved, in order to nerve the disciple to the austerity of its doctrine, and to encourage him to the sacred and perilous chivalry of converting the Polytheist and the Heathen.</s> <s sid="6" id="Pomp.c29.s6">The sectarian sternness which confined virtue and heaven to a chosen few, which saw demons in other gods, and the penalties of hell in other religions--made the believer naturally anxious to convert all to whom he felt the ties of human affection; and the circle thus traced by benevolence to man was yet more widened by a desire for the glory of God.</s> <s sid="7" id="Pomp.c29.s7">It was for the honour of the Christian faith that the Christian boldly forced its tenets upon the scepticism of some, the repugnance of others, the sage contempt of the philosopher, the pious shudder of the people--his very intolerance supplied him with his fittest instruments of success; and the soft Heathen began at last to imagine there must indeed be something holy in a zeal wholly foreign to his experience, which stopped at no obstacle, dreaded no danger, and even at the torture, or on the scaffold, referred a dispute far other than the calm differences of speculative philosophy to the tribunal of an Eternal Judge.</s> <s sid="8" id="Pomp.c29.s8">It was thus that the same fervor which made the Churchman of the middle age a bigot without mercy, made the Christian of the early days a hero without fear.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Pomp.c29.p3"><s sid="9" id="Pomp.c29.s9">Of these more fiery, daring, and earnest natures, not the least ardent was Olinthus.</s> <s sid="10" id="Pomp.c29.s10">No sooner had Apaecides been received by the rites of baptism into the bosom of the Church, than the Nazarene hastened to make him conscious of the impossibility to retain the office and robes of priesthood.</s> <s sid="11" id="Pomp.c29.s11">He could not, it was evident, profess to worship God, and continue even outwardly to honour the idolatrous altars of the Fiend.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Pomp.c29.p4"><s sid="12" id="Pomp.c29.s12">Nor was this all, the sanguine and impetuous mind of Olinthus beheld in the power of Apaecides the means of divulging to the deluded people the juggling mysteries of the oracular Isis.</s> <s sid="13" id="Pomp.c29.s13">He thought Heaven had sent this instrument of his design in order to disabuse the eyes of the crowd, and prepare the way, perchance, for the conversion of a whole city.</s> <s sid="14" id="Pomp.c29.s14">He did not hesitate then to appeal to all the new-kindled enthusiasm of Apaecides, to arouse his courage, and to stimulate his zeal.</s> <s sid="15" id="Pomp.c29.s15">They met, according to previous agreement, the evening after the baptism of Apaecides, in the grove of Cybele, which we have before described.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Pomp.c29.p6"><s sid="18" id="Pomp.c29.s18">Heated and excited as he was, this suggestion was not unpleasing to Apaecides.</s> <s sid="19" id="Pomp.c29.s19">He was rejoiced at so early an opportunity of distinguishing his faith in his new sect, and to his holier feelings were added those of a vindictive loathing at the imposition he had himself suffered, and a desire to avenge it.</s> <s sid="20" id="Pomp.c29.s20">In that sanguine and elastic overbound of obstacles (the rashness necessary to all who undertake venturous and lofty actions), neither Olinthus nor the proselyte perceived the impediments to the success of their scheme, which might be found in the reverent superstition of the people themselves, who would probably be loth, before the sacred altars of the great Egyptian goddess, to believe even the testimony of her priest against her power.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Pomp.c38.p2"><s sid="2" id="Pomp.c38.s2">IT will be remembered that, at the command of Arbaces, Nydia followed the Egyptian to his home, and conversing there with her, he learned from the confession of her despair and remorse, that her hand, and not Julia's, had administered to Glaucus the fatal potion.</s> <s sid="3" id="Pomp.c38.s3">At another time the Egyptian might have conceived a philosophical interest in sounding the depths and origin of the strange and absorbing passion which, in blindness and in slavery, this singular girl had dared to cherish; but at present he spared no thought from himself.</s> <s sid="4" id="Pomp.c38.s4">As, after her confession, the poor Nydia threw herself on her knees before him, and besought him to restore the health and save the life of Glaucus--for in her youth and ignorance she imagined the dark magician all-powerful to effect both--Arbaces, with unheeding ears, was noting only the new expediency of detaining Nydia a prisoner until the trial and fate of Glaucus were decided.</s> <s sid="5" id="Pomp.c38.s5">For if, when he judged her merely the accomplice of Julia in obtaining the philtre, he had felt it was dangerous to the full success of his vengeance to allow her to be at large--to appear, perhaps, as a witness--to avow the manner in which the sense of Glaucus had been darkened, and thus win indulgence to the crime of which he was accused--how much more was she likely to volunteer her testimony when she herself had administered the draught, and, inspired by love, would be only anxious, at any expense of shame, to retrieve her error and preserve her beloved?</s> <s sid="6" id="Pomp.c38.s6">Besides, how unworthy of the rank and repute of Arbaces to be implicated in the disgrace of pandering to the passion of Julia, and assisting in the unholy rites of the Saga of Vesuvius!</s> <s sid="7" id="Pomp.c38.s7">Nothing less, indeed, than his desire to induce Glaucus to own the murder of Apaecides, as a policy evidently the best both for his own permanent safety and his successful suit with Ione, could ever have led him to contemplate the confession of Julia.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Pomp.c38.p3"><s sid="8" id="Pomp.c38.s8">As for Nydia, who was necessarily cut off by her blindness from much of the knowledge of active life, and who, a slave and a stranger, was naturally ignorant of the perils of the Roman law, she thought rather of the illness and delirium of her Athenian, than the crime of which she had vaguely heard him accused, or the chances of the impending trial.</s> <s sid="9" id="Pomp.c38.s9">Poor wretch that she was, whom none addressed, none cared for, what did she know of the senate and the sentence--the hazard of the law--the ferocity of the people--the arena and the lion's den?</s> <s sid="10" id="Pomp.c38.s10">She was accustomed only to associate with the thought of Glaucus everything that was prosperous and lofty--she could not imagine that any peril, save from the madness of her love, could menace that sacred head.</s> <s sid="11" id="Pomp.c38.s11">He seemed to her set apart for the blessings of life.</s> <s sid="12" id="Pomp.c38.s12">She only had disturbed the current of his felicity; she knew not, she dreamed not that the stream, once so bright, was dashing on to darkness and to death.</s> <s sid="13" id="Pomp.c38.s13">It was therefore to restore the brain that she had marred, to save the life that she had endangered that she implored the assistance of the great Egyptian.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Pomp.c38.p5"><s sid="18" id="Pomp.c38.s18">Alone, then, and musingly, he waited the morning light, and with it repaired, as we have seen, to possess himself of the person of Ione.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Pomp.c38.p6" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="Pomp.c38.s19">His primary object, with respect to the unfortunate Neapolitan, was that which he had really stated to Clodius, viz., to prevent her interesting herself actively in the trial of Glaucus, and also to guard against her accusing him (which she would, doubtless, have done) of his former act of perfidy and violence towards her, his ward--denouncing his causes for vengeance against Glaucus--unveiling the hypocrisy of his character--and casting any doubt upon his veracity in the charge which he had made against the Athenian.</s> <s sid="20" id="Pomp.c38.s20">Not till he had encountered her that morning--not till he had heard her loud denunciations--was he aware that he had also another danger to apprehend in her suspicion of his crime.</s> <s sid="21" id="Pomp.c38.s21">He hugged himself now at the thought that these ends were effected: that one, at once the object of his passion and his fear, was in his power.</s> <s sid="22" id="Pomp.c38.s22">He believed more than ever the flattering promises of the stars; and when he sought Ione in that chamber in the inmost recesses of his mysterious mansion to which he had consigned her--when he found her overpowered by blow upon blow, and passing from fit to fit, from violence to torpor, in all the alternations of hysterical disease--he thought more of the loveliness which no frenzy could distort than of the woe which he had brought upon her.</s> <s sid="23" id="Pomp.c38.s23">In that sanguine vanity common to men who through life have been invariably successful, whether in fortune or love, he flattered himself that when Glaucus had perished--when his name was solemnly blackened by the award of a legal judgment, his title to her love for ever forfeited by condemnation to death for the murder of her own brother--her affection would be changed to horror; and that his tenderness and his passion, assisted by all the arts with which he well knew how to dazzle woman's imagination, might elect him to that throne in her heart from which his rival would be so awfully expelled.</s> <s sid="24" id="Pomp.c38.s24">This was his hope: but should it fail, his unholy and fervid passion whispered, <qs/>'At the worst, now she is in my power.'<qe/></s> </p>

his very faults the exuberance of a gentle and joyous nature, how little had his past career fitted him for the trials he was destined to undergo!</s> <s sid="79" id="Pomp.c44.s79">The hoots of the mob, amidst whose plaudits he had so often guided his graceful car and bounding steeds, still rang gratingly in his ear.</s> <s sid="80" id="Pomp.c44.s80">The cold and stony faces of former friends (the co-mates of merry revels) still rose before his eye.</s> <s sid="81" id="Pomp.c44.s81">None now were by to soothe, to sustain, the admired, the adulated stranger.</s> <s sid="82" id="Pomp.c44.s82">These walls opened but on the dread arena of a violent and shameful death.</s> <s sid="83" id="Pomp.c44.s83">And Ione!

<p pid="2" id="Pomp.c46.p2"><s sid="3" id="Pomp.c46.s3">THE awful night preceding the fierce joy of the amphitheatre rolled drearily away, and greyly broke forth the dawn of THE LAST DAY OF POMPEII!</s> <s sid="4" id="Pomp.c46.s4">The air was uncommonly calm and sultry--a thin and dull mist gathered over the valleys and hollows of the broad Campanian fields.</s> <s sid="5" id="Pomp.c46.s5">But yet it was remarked in surprise by the early fishermen, that, despite the exceeding stillness of the atmosphere, the waves of the sea were agitated, and seemed, as it were, to run disturbedly back from the shore; while along the blue and stately Sarnus, whose ancient breadth of channel the traveler now vainly seeks to discover, there crept a hoarse and sullen murmur, as it glided by the laughing plains and the gaudy villas of the wealthy citizens.</s> <s sid="6" id="Pomp.c46.s6">Clear above the low mist rose the time-worn towers of the immemorial town, the red-tiled roofs of the bright streets, the solemn columns of many temples, and the statue-crowned portals of the Forum and the Arch of Triumph.</s> <s sid="7" id="Pomp.c46.s7">Far in the distance, the outline of the circling hills soared above the vapors, and mingled with the changeful hues of the morning sky.</s> <s sid="8" id="Pomp.c46.s8">The cloud that had so long rested over the crest of Vesuvius had suddenly vanished, and its rugged and haughty brow looked without a frown over the beautiful scenes below.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Pomp.c46.p3"><s sid="9" id="Pomp.c46.s9">Despite the earliness of the hour, the gates of the city were already opened.</s> <s sid="10" id="Pomp.c46.s10">Horsemen upon horsemen, vehicle after vehicle, poured rapidly in; and the voices of numerous pedestrian groups, clad in holiday attire, rose high in joyous and excited merriment; the streets were crowded with citizens and strangers from the populous neighborhood of Pompeii; and noisily--fast--confusedly swept the many streams of life towards the fatal show.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Pomp.c46.p4"><s sid="11" id="Pomp.c46.s11">Despite the vast size of the amphitheatre, seemingly so disproportioned to the extent of the city, and formed to include nearly the whole population of Pompeii itself, so great, on extraordinary occasions, was the concourse of strangers from all parts of Campania, that the space before it was usually crowded for several hours previous to the commencement of the sports, by such persons as were not entitled by their rank to appointed and special seats.</s> <s sid="12" id="Pomp.c46.s12">And the intense curiosity which the trial and sentence of two criminals so remarkable had occasioned, increased the crowd on this day to an extent wholly unprecedented.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Pomp.c46.p5"><s sid="13" id="Pomp.c46.s13">While the common people, with the lively vehemence of their Campanian blood, were thus pushing, scrambling, hurrying on--yet, amidst all their eagerness, preserving, as is now the wont with Italians in such meetings, a wonderful order and unquarrelsome good humor, a strange visitor to Arbaces was threading her way to his sequestered mansion.</s> <s sid="14" id="Pomp.c46.s14">At the sight of her quaint and primaeval garb--of her wild gait and gestures--the passengers she encountered touched each other and smiled; but as they caught a glimpse of her countenance, the mirth was hushed at once, for the face was as the face of the dead; and, what with the ghastly features and obsolete robes of the stranger, it seemed as if one long entombed had risen once more amongst the living.</s> <s sid="15" id="Pomp.c46.s15">In silence and awe each group gave way as she passed along, and she soon gained the broad porch of the Egyptian's palace.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Pomp.c46.p6"><s sid="16" id="Pomp.c46.s16">The black porter, like the rest of the world, astir at an unusual hour, started as he opened the door to her summons.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Pomp.c46.p7"><s sid="17" id="Pomp.c46.s17">The sleep of the Egyptian had been usually profound during the night; but, as the dawn approached, it was disturbed by strange and unquiet dreams, which impressed him the more as they were colored by the peculiar philosophy he embraced.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Pomp.c46.p8"><s sid="18" id="Pomp.c46.s18">He thought that he was transported to the bowels of the earth, and that he stood alone in a mighty cavern supported by enormous columns of rough and primaeval rock, lost, as they ascended, in the vastness of a shadow athwart whose eternal darkness no beam of day had ever glanced.</s> <s sid="19" id="Pomp.c46.s19">And in the space between these columns were huge wheels, that whirled round and round unceasingly, and with a rushing and roaring noise.</s> <s sid="20" id="Pomp.c46.s20">Only to the right and left extremities of the cavern, the space between the pillars was left bare, and the apertures stretched away into galleries--not wholly dark, but dimly lighted by wandering and erratic fires, that, meteor-like, now crept (as the snake creeps) along the rugged and dank soil; and now leaped fiercely to and fro, darting across the vast gloom in wild gambols--suddenly disappearing, and as suddenly bursting into tenfold brilliancy and power.</s> <s sid="21" id="Pomp.c46.s21">And while he gazed wonderingly upon the gallery to the left, thin, mist-like, aerial shapes passed slowly up; and when they had gained the hall they seemed to rise aloft, and to vanish, as the smoke vanishes, in the measureless ascent.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Pomp.c46.p9"><s sid="22" id="Pomp.c46.s22">He turned in fear towards the opposite extremity--and behold! there came swiftly, from the gloom above, similar shadows, which swept hurriedly along the gallery to the right, as if borne involuntarily adown the sides of some invisible stream; and the faces of these spectres were more distinct than those that emerged from the opposite passage; and on some was joy, and on others sorrow--some were vivid with expectation and hope, some unutterably dejected by awe and horror.</s> <s sid="23" id="Pomp.c46.s23">And so they passed, swift and constantly on, till the eyes of the gazer grew dizzy and blinded with the whirl of an ever-varying succession of things impelled by a power apparently not their own.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Pomp.c46.p10"><s sid="24" id="Pomp.c46.s24">Arbaces turned away, and, in the recess of the hall, he saw the mighty form of a giantess seated upon a pile of skulls, and her hands were busy upon a pale and shadowy woof; and he saw that the woof communicated with the numberless wheels, as if it guided the machinery of their movements.</s> <s sid="25" id="Pomp.c46.s25">He thought his feet, by some secret agency, were impelled towards the female, and that he was borne onwards till he stood before her, face to face.</s> <s sid="26" id="Pomp.c46.s26">The countenance of the giantess was solemn and hushed, and beautifully serene.</s> <s sid="27" id="Pomp.c46.s27">It was as the face of some colossal sculpture of his own ancestral sphinx.</s> <s sid="28" id="Pomp.c46.s28">No passion--no human emotion, disturbed its brooding and unwrinkled brow: there was neither sadness, nor joy, nor memory, nor hope: it was free from all with which the wild human heart can sympathize.</s> <s sid="29" id="Pomp.c46.s29">The mystery of mysteries rested on its beauty--it awed, but terrified not: it was the Incarnation of the sublime.</s> <s sid="30" id="Pomp.c46.s30">And Arbaces felt the voice leave his lips, without an impulse of his own; and the voice asked:</s> </p>
