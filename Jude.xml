   "Yea, many there be that have run out of their wits for

    women, and become servants for their sakes.  Many also

    have perished, have erred, and sinned, for women.... O

<title>I</title>

<p pid="1" id="Jude.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="Jude.c1.s1">The schoolmaster was leaving the village, and everybody seemed sorry.</s> <s sid="2" id="Jude.c1.s2">The miller at Cresscombe lent him the small white tilted cart and horse to carry his goods to the city of his destination, about twenty miles off, such a vehicle proving of quite sufficient size for the departing teacher's effects.</s> <s sid="3" id="Jude.c1.s3">For the schoolhouse had been partly furnished by the managers, and the only cumbersome article possessed by the master, in addition to the packing-case of books, was a cottage piano that he had bought at an auction during the year in which he thought of learning instrumental music.</s> <s sid="4" id="Jude.c1.s4">But the enthusiasm having waned he had never acquired any skill in playing, and the purchased article had been a perpetual trouble to him ever since in moving house.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Jude.c1.p2"><s sid="5" id="Jude.c1.s5">The rector had gone away for the day, being a man who disliked the sight of changes.</s> <s sid="6" id="Jude.c1.s6">He did not mean to return till the evening, when the new school-teacher would have arrived and settled in, and everything would be smooth again.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Jude.c1.p3"><s sid="7" id="Jude.c1.s7">The blacksmith, the farm bailiff, and the schoolmaster himself were standing in perplexed attitudes in the parlour before the instrument.</s> <s sid="8" id="Jude.c1.s8">The master had remarked that even if he got it into the cart he should not know what to do with it on his arrival at Christminster, the city he was bound for, since he was only going into temporary lodgings just at first.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Jude.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="Jude.c1.s9">A little boy of eleven, who had been thoughtfully assisting in the packing, joined the group of men, and as they rubbed their chins he spoke up, blushing at the sound of his own voice:</s> <s sid="10" id="Jude.c1.s10"><qs/>"Aunt have got a great fuel-house, and it could be put there, perhaps, till you've found a place to settle in, sir."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Jude.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="Jude.c1.s11"><qs/>"A proper good notion,"<qe/> said the blacksmith.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Jude.c1.p6"><s sid="12" id="Jude.c1.s12">It was decided that a deputation should wait on the boy's aunt--an old maiden resident--and ask her if she would house the piano till Mr. Phillotson should send for it.</s> <s sid="13" id="Jude.c1.s13">The smith and the bailiff started to see about the practicability of the suggested shelter, and the boy and the schoolmaster were left standing alone.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Jude.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="Jude.c1.s14"><qs/>"Sorry I am going, Jude?"<qe/> asked the latter kindly.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Jude.c1.p8"><s sid="15" id="Jude.c1.s15">Tears rose into the boy's eyes, for he was not among the regular day scholars, who came unromantically close to the schoolmaster's life, but one who had attended the night school only during the present teacher's term of office.</s> <s sid="16" id="Jude.c1.s16">The regular scholars, if the truth must be told, stood at the present moment afar off, like certain historic disciples, indisposed to any enthusiastic volunteering of aid.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Jude.c1.p9"><s sid="17" id="Jude.c1.s17">The boy awkwardly opened the book he held in his hand, which Mr. Phillotson had bestowed on him as a parting gift, and admitted that he was sorry.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Jude.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="Jude.c1.s18"><qs/>"So am I,"<qe/> said Mr. Phillotson.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Jude.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="Jude.c1.s19"><qs/>"Why do you go, sir?"<qe/> asked the boy.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Jude.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="Jude.c1.s20"><qs/>"Ah--that would be a long story.</s> <s sid="21" id="Jude.c1.s21">You wouldn't understand my reasons, Jude.</s> <s sid="22" id="Jude.c1.s22">You will, perhaps, when you are older."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="Jude.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="Jude.c1.s23"><qs/>"I think I should now, sir."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Jude.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="Jude.c1.s24"><qs/>"Well--don't speak of this everywhere.</s> <s sid="25" id="Jude.c1.s25">You know what a university is, and a university degree?</s> <s sid="26" id="Jude.c1.s26">It is the necessary hallmark of a man who wants to do anything in teaching.</s> <s sid="27" id="Jude.c1.s27">My scheme, or dream, is to be a university graduate, and then to be ordained.</s> <s sid="28" id="Jude.c1.s28">By going to live at Christminster, or near it, I shall be at headquarters, so to speak, and if my scheme is practicable at all, I consider that being on the spot will afford me a better chance of carrying it out than I should have elsewhere."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Jude.c1.p15"><s sid="29" id="Jude.c1.s29">The smith and his companion returned.</s> <s sid="30" id="Jude.c1.s30">Old Miss Fawley's fuel-house was dry, and eminently practicable; and she seemed willing to give the instrument standing-room there.</s> <s sid="31" id="Jude.c1.s31">It was accordingly left in the school till the evening, when more hands would be available for removing it; and the schoolmaster gave a final glance round.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Jude.c1.p16"><s sid="32" id="Jude.c1.s32">The boy Jude assisted in loading some small articles, and at nine o'clock Mr. Phillotson mounted beside his box of books and other _impedimenta_, and bade his friends good-bye.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Jude.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="Jude.c1.s33"><qs/>"I shan't forget you, Jude,"<qe/> he said, smiling, as the cart moved off.</s> <s sid="34" id="Jude.c1.s34"><qs/>"Be a good boy, remember; and be kind to animals and birds, and read all you can.</s> <s sid="35" id="Jude.c1.s35">And if ever you come to Christminster remember you hunt me out for old acquaintance' sake."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="Jude.c1.p18"><s sid="36" id="Jude.c1.s36">The cart creaked across the green, and disappeared round the corner by the rectory-house.</s> <s sid="37" id="Jude.c1.s37">The boy returned to the draw-well at the edge of the greensward, where he had left his buckets when he went to help his patron and teacher in the loading.</s> <s sid="38" id="Jude.c1.s38">There was a quiver in his lip now and after opening the well-cover to begin lowering the bucket he paused and leant with his forehead and arms against the framework, his face wearing the fixity of a thoughtful child's who has felt the pricks of life somewhat before his time.</s> <s sid="39" id="Jude.c1.s39">The well into which he was looking was as ancient as the village itself, and from his present position appeared as a long circular perspective ending in a shining disk of quivering water at a distance of a hundred feet down.</s> <s sid="40" id="Jude.c1.s40">There was a lining of green moss near the top, and nearer still the hart's-tongue fern.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="Jude.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="Jude.c1.s41">He said to himself, in the melodramatic tones of a whimsical boy, that the schoolmaster had drawn at that well scores of times on a morning like this, and would never draw there any more.</s> <s sid="42" id="Jude.c1.s42"><qs/>"I've seen him look down into it, when he was tired with his drawing, just as I do now, and when he rested a bit before carrying the buckets home!</s> <s sid="43" id="Jude.c1.s43">But he was too clever to bide here any longer--a small sleepy place like this!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="Jude.c1.p20"><s sid="44" id="Jude.c1.s44">A tear rolled from his eye into the depths of the well.</s> <s sid="45" id="Jude.c1.s45">The morning was a little foggy, and the boy's breathing unfurled itself as a thicker fog upon the still and heavy air.</s> <s sid="46" id="Jude.c1.s46">His thoughts were interrupted by a sudden outcry:</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="Jude.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="Jude.c1.s47"><qs/>"Bring on that water, will ye, you idle young harlican!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="Jude.c1.p22"><s sid="48" id="Jude.c1.s48">It came from an old woman who had emerged from her door towards the garden gate of a green-thatched cottage not far off.</s> <s sid="49" id="Jude.c1.s49">The boy quickly waved a signal of assent, drew the water with what was a great effort for one of his stature, landed and emptied the big bucket into his own pair of smaller ones, and pausing a moment for breath, started with them across the patch of clammy greensward whereon the well stood--nearly in the centre of the little village, or rather hamlet of Marygreen.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="Jude.c1.p23"><s sid="50" id="Jude.c1.s50">It was as old-fashioned as it was small, and it rested in the lap of an undulating upland adjoining the North Wessex downs.</s> <s sid="51" id="Jude.c1.s51">Old as it was, however, the well-shaft was probably the only relic of the local history that remained absolutely unchanged.</s> <s sid="52" id="Jude.c1.s52">Many of the thatched and dormered dwelling-houses had been pulled down of late years, and many trees felled on the green.</s> <s sid="53" id="Jude.c1.s53">Above all, the original church, hump-backed, wood-turreted, and quaintly hipped, had been taken down, and either cracked up into heaps of road-metal in the lane, or utilized as pig-sty walls, garden seats, guard-stones to fences, and rockeries in the flower-beds of the neighbourhood.</s> <s sid="54" id="Jude.c1.s54">In place of it a tall new building of modern Gothic design, unfamiliar to English eyes, had been erected on a new piece of ground by a certain obliterator of historic records who had run down from London and back in a day.</s> <s sid="55" id="Jude.c1.s55">The site whereon so long had stood the ancient temple to the Christian divinities was not even recorded on the green and level grass-plot that had immemorially been the churchyard, the obliterated graves being commemorated by eighteen-penny cast-iron crosses warranted to last five years.</s> </p></div>

<title>II</title>

<p pid="1" id="Jude.c2.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="Jude.c2.s1">Slender as was Jude Fawley's frame he bore the two brimming house-buckets of water to the cottage without resting.</s> <s sid="2" id="Jude.c2.s2">Over the door was a little rectangular piece of blue board, on which was painted in yellow letters, <qs/>"Drusilla Fawley, Baker."<qe/></s> <s sid="3" id="Jude.c2.s3">Within the little lead panes of the window--this being one of the few old houses left--were five bottles of sweets, and three buns on a plate of the willow pattern.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Jude.c2.p2"><s sid="4" id="Jude.c2.s4">While emptying the buckets at the back of the house he could hear an animated conversation in progress within-doors between his great-aunt, the Drusilla of the sign-board, and some other villagers.</s> <s sid="5" id="Jude.c2.s5">Having seen the school-master depart, they were summing up particulars of the event, and indulging in predictions of his future.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Jude.c2.p3" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="Jude.c2.s6"><qs/>"And who's he?"<qe/> asked one, comparatively a stranger, when the boy entered.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Jude.c2.p4" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="Jude.c2.s7"><qs/>"Well ye med ask it, Mrs. Williams.</s> <s sid="8" id="Jude.c2.s8">He's my great-nephew--come since you was last this way."<qe/></s> <s sid="9" id="Jude.c2.s9">The old inhabitant who answered was a tall, gaunt woman, who spoke tragically on the most trivial subject, and gave a phrase of her conversation to each auditor in turn.</s> <s sid="10" id="Jude.c2.s10">"He come from Mellstock, down in South Wessex, about a year ago--worse luck for 'n, Belinda" (turning to the right) "where his father was living, and was took wi' the shakings for death, and died in two days, as you know, Caroline" (turning to the left).</s> <s sid="11" id="Jude.c2.s11"><qs/>"It would ha' been a blessing if Goddy-mighty had took thee too, wi' thy mother and father, poor useless boy!</s> <s sid="12" id="Jude.c2.s12">But I've got him here to stay with me till I can see what's to be done with un, though I am obliged to let him earn any penny he can.</s> <s sid="13" id="Jude.c2.s13">Just now he's a-scaring of birds for Farmer Troutham.</s> <s sid="14" id="Jude.c2.s14">It keeps him out of mischty.</s> <s sid="15" id="Jude.c2.s15">Why do ye turn away, Jude?"<qe/> she continued, as the boy, feeling the impact of their glances like slaps upon his face, moved aside.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Jude.c2.p5" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="Jude.c2.s16">The local washerwoman replied that it was perhaps a very good plan of Miss or Mrs. Fawley's (as they called her indifferently) to have him with her--<qs/>"to kip 'ee company in your loneliness, fetch water, shet the winder-shetters o' nights, and help in the bit o' baking."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Jude.c2.p6" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="Jude.c2.s17">Miss Fawley doubted it....  <qs/>"Why didn't ye get the schoolmaster to take 'ee to Christminster wi' un, and make a scholar of 'ee,"<qe/> she continued, in frowning pleasantry.</s> <s sid="18" id="Jude.c2.s18"><qs/>"I'm sure he couldn't ha' took a better one.</s> <s sid="19" id="Jude.c2.s19">The boy is crazy for books, that he is.</s> <s sid="20" id="Jude.c2.s20">It runs in our family rather.</s> <s sid="21" id="Jude.c2.s21">His cousin Sue is just the same--so I've heard; but I have not seen the child for years, though she was born in this place, within these four walls, as it happened.</s> <s sid="22" id="Jude.c2.s22">My niece and her husband, after they were married, didn' get a house of their own for some year or more; and then they only had one till--Well, I won't go into that.</s> <s sid="23" id="Jude.c2.s23">Jude, my child, don't you ever marry.</s> <s sid="24" id="Jude.c2.s24">'Tisn't for the Fawleys to take that step any more.</s> <s sid="25" id="Jude.c2.s25">She, their only one, was like a child o' my own, Belinda, till the split come!</s> <s sid="26" id="Jude.c2.s26">Ah, that a little maid should know such changes!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Jude.c2.p7"><s sid="27" id="Jude.c2.s27">Jude, finding the general attention again centering on himself, went out to the bakehouse, where he ate the cake provided for his breakfast.</s> <s sid="28" id="Jude.c2.s28">The end of his spare time had now arrived, and emerging from the garden by getting over the hedge at the back he pursued a path northward, till he came to a wide and lonely depression in the general level of the upland, which was sown as a corn-field.</s> <s sid="29" id="Jude.c2.s29">This vast concave was the scene of his labours for Mr Troutham the farmer, and he descended into the midst of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Jude.c2.p8"><s sid="30" id="Jude.c2.s30">The brown surface of the field went right up towards the sky all round, where it was lost by degrees in the mist that shut out the actual verge and accentuated the solitude.</s> <s sid="31" id="Jude.c2.s31">The only marks on the uniformity of the scene were a rick of last year's produce standing in the midst of the arable, the rooks that rose at his approach, and the path athwart the fallow by which he had come, trodden now by he hardly knew whom, though once by many of his own dead family.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Jude.c2.p9" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="Jude.c2.s32"><qs/>"How ugly it is here!"<qe/> he murmured.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Jude.c2.p10"><s sid="33" id="Jude.c2.s33">The fresh harrow-lines seemed to stretch like the channellings in a piece of new corduroy, lending a meanly utilitarian air to the expanse, taking away its gradations, and depriving it of all history beyond that of the few recent months, though to every clod and stone there really attached associations enough and to spare--echoes of songs from ancient harvest-days, of spoken words, and of sturdy deeds.</s> <s sid="34" id="Jude.c2.s34">Every inch of ground had been the site, first or last, of energy, gaiety, horse-play, bickerings, weariness.</s> <s sid="35" id="Jude.c2.s35">Groups of gleaners had squatted in the sun on every square yard.</s> <s sid="36" id="Jude.c2.s36">Love-matches that had populated the adjoining hamlet had been made up there between reaping and carrying.</s> <s sid="37" id="Jude.c2.s37">Under the hedge which divided the field from a distant plantation girls had given themselves to lovers who would not turn their heads to look at them by the next harvest; and in that ancient cornfield many a man had made love-promises to a woman at whose voice he had trembled by the next seed-time after fulfilling them in the church adjoining.</s> <s sid="38" id="Jude.c2.s38">But this neither Jude nor the rooks around him considered.</s> <s sid="39" id="Jude.c2.s39">For them it was a lonely place, possessing, in the one view, only the quality of a work-ground, and in the other that of a granary good to feed in.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Jude.c2.p11"><s sid="40" id="Jude.c2.s40">The boy stood under the rick before mentioned, and every few seconds used his clacker or rattle briskly.</s> <s sid="41" id="Jude.c2.s41">At each clack the rooks left off pecking, and rose and went away on their leisurely wings, burnished like tassets of mail, afterwards wheeling back and regarding him warily, and descending to feed at a more respectful distance.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Jude.c2.p12"><s sid="42" id="Jude.c2.s42">He sounded the clacker till his arm ached, and at length his heart grew sympathetic with the birds' thwarted desires.</s> <s sid="43" id="Jude.c2.s43">They seemed, like himself, to be living in a world which did not want them.</s> <s sid="44" id="Jude.c2.s44">Why should he frighten them away?</s> <s sid="45" id="Jude.c2.s45">They took upon more and more the aspect of gentle friends and pensioners--the only friends he could claim as being in the least degree interested in him, for his aunt had often told him that she was not.</s> <s sid="46" id="Jude.c2.s46">He ceased his rattling, and they alighted anew.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="Jude.c2.p13" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="Jude.c2.s47"><qs/>"Poor little dears!"<qe/> said Jude, aloud.</s> <s sid="48" id="Jude.c2.s48"><qs/>"You SHALL have some dinner-- you shall.</s> <s sid="49" id="Jude.c2.s49">There is enough for us all.</s> <s sid="50" id="Jude.c2.s50">Farmer Troutham can afford to let you have some.</s> <s sid="51" id="Jude.c2.s51">Eat, then my dear little birdies, and make a good meal!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Jude.c2.p14"><s sid="52" id="Jude.c2.s52">They stayed and ate, inky spots on the nut-brown soil, and Jude enjoyed their appetite.</s> <s sid="53" id="Jude.c2.s53">A magic thread of fellow-feeling united his own life with theirs.</s> <s sid="54" id="Jude.c2.s54">Puny and sorry as those lives were, they much resembled his own.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Jude.c2.p15"><s sid="55" id="Jude.c2.s55">His clacker he had by this time thrown away from him, as being a mean and sordid instrument, offensive both to the birds and to himself as their friend.</s> <s sid="56" id="Jude.c2.s56">All at once he became conscious of a smart blow upon his buttocks, followed by a loud clack, which announced to his surprised senses that the clacker had been the instrument of offence used.</s> <s sid="57" id="Jude.c2.s57">The birds and Jude started up simultaneously, and the dazed eyes of the latter beheld the farmer in person, the great Troutham himself, his red face glaring down upon Jude's cowering frame, the clacker swinging in his hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Jude.c2.p16" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="Jude.c2.s58"><qs/>"So it's <alt-qs/>'Eat my dear birdies,'<alt-qe/> is it, young man?</s> <s sid="59" id="Jude.c2.s59"><alt-qs/>'Eat, dear birdies,'<alt-qe/> indeed!</s> <s sid="60" id="Jude.c2.s60">I'll tickle your breeches, and see if you say, <alt-qs/>'Eat, dear birdies,'<alt-qe/> again in a hurry!</s> <s sid="61" id="Jude.c2.s61">And you've been idling at the schoolmaster's too, instead of coming here, ha'n't ye, hey?</s> <s sid="62" id="Jude.c2.s62">That's how you earn your sixpence a day for keeping the rooks off my corn!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Jude.c2.p17"><s sid="63" id="Jude.c2.s63">Whilst saluting Jude's ears with this impassioned rhetoric, Troutham had seized his left hand with his own left, and swinging his slim frame round him at arm's-length, again struck Jude on the hind parts with the flat side of Jude's own rattle, till the field echoed with the blows, which were delivered once or twice at each revolution.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="Jude.c2.p18" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="Jude.c2.s64"><qs/>"Don't 'ee, sir--please don't 'ee!"<qe/> cried the whirling child, as helpless under the centrifugal tendency of his person as a hooked fish swinging to land, and beholding the hill, the rick, the plantation, the path, and the rooks going round and round him in an amazing circular race.</s> <s sid="65" id="Jude.c2.s65"><qs/>"I--I sir--only meant that--there was a good crop in the ground--I saw 'em sow it--and the rooks could have a little bit for dinner--and you wouldn't miss it, sir--and Mr. Phillotson said I was to be kind to 'em--oh, oh, oh!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="Jude.c2.p19"><s sid="66" id="Jude.c2.s66">This truthful explanation seemed to exasperate the farmer even more than if Jude had stoutly denied saying anything at all, and he still smacked the whirling urchin, the clacks of the instrument continuing to resound all across the field and as far as the ears of distant workers--who gathered thereupon that Jude was pursuing his business of clacking with great assiduity--and echoing from the brand-new church tower just behind the mist, towards the building of which structure the farmer had largely subscribed, to testify his love for God and man.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="Jude.c2.p20"><s sid="67" id="Jude.c2.s67">Presently Troutham grew tired of his punitive task, and depositing the quivering boy on his legs, took a sixpence from his pocket and gave it him in payment for his day's work, telling him to go home and never let him see him in one of those fields again.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="Jude.c2.p21"><s sid="68" id="Jude.c2.s68">Jude leaped out of arm's reach, and walked along the trackway weeping--not from the pain, though that was keen enough; not from the perception of the flaw in the terrestrial scheme, by which what was good for God's birds was bad for God's gardener; but with the awful sense that he had wholly disgraced himself before he had been a year in the parish, and hence might be a burden to his great-aunt for life.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="Jude.c2.p22"><s sid="69" id="Jude.c2.s69">With this shadow on his mind he did not care to show himself in the village, and went homeward by a roundabout track behind a high hedge and across a pasture.</s> <s sid="70" id="Jude.c2.s70">Here he beheld scores of coupled earthworms lying half their length on the surface of the damp ground, as they always did in such weather at that time of the year.</s> <s sid="71" id="Jude.c2.s71">It was impossible to advance in regular steps without crushing some of them at each tread.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="Jude.c2.p23"><s sid="72" id="Jude.c2.s72">Though Farmer Troutham had just hurt him, he was a boy who could not himself bear to hurt anything.</s> <s sid="73" id="Jude.c2.s73">He had never brought home a nest of young birds without lying awake in misery half the night after, and often reinstating them and the nest in their original place the next morning.</s> <s sid="74" id="Jude.c2.s74">He could scarcely bear to see trees cut down or lopped, from a fancy that it hurt them; and late pruning, when the sap was up and the tree bled profusely, had been a positive grief to him in his infancy.</s> <s sid="75" id="Jude.c2.s75">This weakness of character, as it may be called, suggested that he was the sort of man who was born to ache a good deal before the fall of the curtain upon his unnecessary life should signify that all was well with him again.</s> <s sid="76" id="Jude.c2.s76">He carefully picked his way on tiptoe among the earthworms, without killing a single one.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Jude.c7.p3"><s sid="5" id="Jude.c7.s5">He had anticipated much pleasure in this afternoon's reading, under the quiet roof of his great-aunt's house as formerly, where he now slept only two nights a week.</s> <s sid="6" id="Jude.c7.s6">But a new thing, a great hitch, had happened yesterday in the gliding and noiseless current of his life, and he felt as a snake must feel who has sloughed off its winter skin, and cannot understand the brightness and sensitiveness of its new one.</s> </p>

<title>I</title>

<p pid="1" id="Jude.c12.p1"><s sid="1" id="Jude.c12.s1">The next noteworthy move in Jude's life was that in which he appeared gliding steadily onward through a dusky landscape of some three years' later leafage than had graced his courtship of Arabella, and the disruption of his coarse conjugal life with her.</s> <s sid="2" id="Jude.c12.s2">He was walking towards Christminster City, at a point a mile or two to the south-west of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Jude.c12.p2"><s sid="3" id="Jude.c12.s3">He had at last found himself clear of Marygreen and Alfredston: he was out of his apprenticeship, and with his tools at his back seemed to be in the way of making a new start--the start to which, barring the interruption involved in his intimacy and married experience with Arabella, he had been looking forward for about ten years.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Jude.c12.p3" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="Jude.c12.s4">Jude would now have been described as a young man with a forcible, meditative, and earnest rather than handsome cast of countenance.</s> <s sid="5" id="Jude.c12.s5">He was of dark complexion, with dark harmonizing eyes, and he wore a closely trimmed black beard of more advanced growth than is usual at his age; this, with his great mass of black curly hair, was some trouble to him in combing and washing out the stone-dust that settled on it in the pursuit of his trade.</s> <s sid="6" id="Jude.c12.s6">His capabilities in the latter, having been acquired in the country, were of an all-round sort, including monumental stone-cutting, gothic free-stone work for the restoration of churches, and carving of a general kind.</s> <s sid="7" id="Jude.c12.s7">In London he would probably have become specialized and have made himself a <qs/>"moulding mason,"<qe/><sss/> a <sse/><qs/>"foliage sculptor"<qe/><sss/>--perhaps a <sse/><qs/>"statuary."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Jude.c12.p4"><s sid="8" id="Jude.c12.s8">He had that afternoon driven in a cart from Alfredston to the village nearest the city in this direction, and was now walking the remaining four miles rather from choice than from necessity, having always fancied himself arriving thus.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Jude.c12.p5"><s sid="9" id="Jude.c12.s9">The ultimate impulse to come had had a curious origin--one more nearly related to the emotional side of him than to the intellectual, as is often the case with young men.</s> <s sid="10" id="Jude.c12.s10">One day while in lodgings at Alfredston he had gone to Marygreen to see his old aunt, and had observed between the brass candlesticks on her mantlepiece the photograph of a pretty girlish face, in a broad hat with radiating folds under the brim like the rays of a halo.</s> <s sid="11" id="Jude.c12.s11">He had asked who she was.</s> <s sid="12" id="Jude.c12.s12">His grand-aunt had gruffly replied that she was his cousin Sue Bridehead, of the inimical branch of the family; and on further questioning the old woman had replied that the girl lived in Christminster, though she did not know where, or what she was doing.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Jude.c12.p6"><s sid="13" id="Jude.c12.s13">His aunt would not give him the photograph.</s> <s sid="14" id="Jude.c12.s14">But it haunted him; and ultimately formed a quickening ingredient in his latent intent of following his friend the school master thither.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Jude.c12.p7"><s sid="15" id="Jude.c12.s15">He now paused at the top of a crooked and gentle declivity, and obtained his first near view of the city.</s> <s sid="16" id="Jude.c12.s16">Grey-stoned and dun-roofed, it stood within hail of the Wessex border, and almost with the tip of one small toe within it, at the northernmost point of the crinkled line along which the leisurely Thames strokes the fields of that ancient kingdom.</s> <s sid="17" id="Jude.c12.s17">The buildings now lay quiet in the sunset, a vane here and there on their many spires and domes giving sparkle to a picture of sober secondary and tertiary hues.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Jude.c12.p8"><s sid="18" id="Jude.c12.s18">Reaching the bottom he moved along the level way between pollard willows growing indistinct in the twilight, and soon confronted the outmost lamps of the town--some of those lamps which had sent into the sky the gleam and glory that caught his strained gaze in his days of dreaming, so many years ago.</s> <s sid="19" id="Jude.c12.s19">They winked their yellow eyes at him dubiously, and as if, though they had been awaiting him all these years in disappointment at his tarrying, they did not much want him now.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Jude.c12.p9" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="Jude.c12.s20">He was a species of Dick Whittington whose spirit was touched to finer issues than a mere material gain.</s> <s sid="21" id="Jude.c12.s21">He went along the outlying streets with the cautious tread of an explorer.</s> <s sid="22" id="Jude.c12.s22">He saw nothing of the real city in the suburbs on this side.</s> <s sid="23" id="Jude.c12.s23">His first want being a lodging he scrutinized carefully such localities as seemed to offer on inexpensive terms the modest type of accommodation he demanded; and after inquiry took a room in a suburb nicknamed <qs/>"Beersheba,"<qe/> though he did not know this at the time.</s> <s sid="24" id="Jude.c12.s24">Here he installed himself, and having had some tea sallied forth.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Jude.c12.p10"><s sid="25" id="Jude.c12.s25">It was a windy, whispering, moonless night.</s> <s sid="26" id="Jude.c12.s26">To guide himself he opened under a lamp a map he had brought.</s> <s sid="27" id="Jude.c12.s27">The breeze ruffled and fluttered it, but he could see enough to decide on the direction he should take to reach the heart of the place.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Jude.c12.p11"><s sid="28" id="Jude.c12.s28">After many turnings he came up to the first ancient mediaeval pile that he had encountered.</s> <s sid="29" id="Jude.c12.s29">It was a college, as he could see by the gateway.</s> <s sid="30" id="Jude.c12.s30">He entered it, walked round, and penetrated to dark corners which no lamplight reached.</s> <s sid="31" id="Jude.c12.s31">Close to this college was another; and a little further on another; and then he began to be encircled as it were with the breath and sentiment of the venerable city.</s> <s sid="32" id="Jude.c12.s32">When he passed objects out of harmony with its general expression he allowed his eyes to slip over them as if he did not see them.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Jude.c12.p12"><s sid="33" id="Jude.c12.s33">A bell began clanging, and he listened till a hundred-and-one strokes had sounded.</s> <s sid="34" id="Jude.c12.s34">He must have made a mistake, he thought: it was meant for a hundred.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="Jude.c12.p13"><s sid="35" id="Jude.c12.s35">When the gates were shut, and he could no longer get into the quadrangles, he rambled under the walls and doorways, feeling with his fingers the contours of their mouldings and carving.</s> <s sid="36" id="Jude.c12.s36">The minutes passed, fewer and fewer people were visible, and still he serpentined among the shadows, for had he not imagined these scenes through ten bygone years, and what mattered a night's rest for once?</s> <s sid="37" id="Jude.c12.s37">High against the black sky the flash of a lamp would show crocketed pinnacles and indented battlements.</s> <s sid="38" id="Jude.c12.s38">Down obscure alleys, apparently never trodden now by the foot of man, and whose very existence seemed to be forgotten, there would jut into the path porticoes, oriels, doorways of enriched and florid middle-age design, their extinct air being accentuated by the rottenness of the stones.</s> <s sid="39" id="Jude.c12.s39">It seemed impossible that modern thought could house itself in such decrepit and superseded chambers.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Jude.c12.p14"><s sid="40" id="Jude.c12.s40">Knowing not a human being here, Jude began to be impressed with the isolation of his own personality, as with a self-spectre, the sensation being that of one who walked but could not make himself seen or heard.</s> <s sid="41" id="Jude.c12.s41">He drew his breath pensively, and, seeming thus almost his own ghost, gave his thoughts to the other ghostly presences with which the nooks were haunted.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Jude.c12.p15"><s sid="42" id="Jude.c12.s42">During the interval of preparation for this venture, since his wife and furniture's uncompromising disappearance into space, he had read and learnt almost all that could be read and learnt by one in his position, of the worthies who had spent their youth within these reverend walls, and whose souls had haunted them in their maturer age.</s> <s sid="43" id="Jude.c12.s43">Some of them, by the accidents of his reading, loomed out in his fancy disproportionately large by comparison with the rest.</s> <s sid="44" id="Jude.c12.s44">The brushings of the wind against the angles, buttresses, and door-jambs were as the passing of these only other inhabitants, the tappings of each ivy leaf on its neighbour were as the mutterings of their mournful souls, the shadows as their thin shapes in nervous movement, making him comrades in his solitude.</s> <s sid="45" id="Jude.c12.s45">In the gloom it was as if he ran against them without feeling their bodily frames.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Jude.c12.p16"><s sid="46" id="Jude.c12.s46">The streets were now deserted, but on account of these things he could not go in.</s> <s sid="47" id="Jude.c12.s47">There were poets abroad, of early date and of late, from the friend and eulogist of Shakespeare down to him who has recently passed into silence, and that musical one of the tribe who is still among us.</s> <s sid="48" id="Jude.c12.s48">Speculative philosophers drew along, not always with wrinkled foreheads and hoary hair as in framed portraits, but pink-faced, slim, and active as in youth; modern divines sheeted in their surplices, among whom the most real to Jude Fawley were the founders of the religious school called Tractarian; the well-known three, the enthusiast, the poet, and the formularist, the echoes of whose teachings had influenced him even in his obscure home.</s> <s sid="49" id="Jude.c12.s49">A start of aversion appeared in his fancy to move them at sight of those other sons of the place, the form in the full-bottomed wig, statesman, rake, reasoner, and sceptic; the smoothly shaven historian so ironically civil to Christianity; with others of the same incredulous temper, who knew each quad as well as the faithful, and took equal freedom in haunting its cloisters.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Jude.c12.p17"><s sid="50" id="Jude.c12.s50">He regarded the statesmen in their various types, men of firmer movement and less dreamy air; the scholar, the speaker, the plodder; the man whose mind grew with his growth in years, and the man whose mind contracted with the same.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="Jude.c12.p18"><s sid="51" id="Jude.c12.s51">The scientists and philologists followed on in his mind-sight in an odd impossible combination, men of meditative faces, strained foreheads, and weak-eyed as bats with constant research; then official characters--such men as governor-generals and lord-lieutenants, in whom he took little interest; chief-justices and lord chancellors, silent thin-lipped figures of whom he knew barely the names.</s> <s sid="52" id="Jude.c12.s52">A keener regard attached to the prelates, by reason of his own former hopes.</s> <s sid="53" id="Jude.c12.s53">Of them he had an ample band--some men of heart, others rather men of head; he who apologized for the Church in Latin; the saintly author of the Evening Hymn; and near them the great itinerant preacher, hymn-writer, and zealot, shadowed like Jude by his matrimonial difficulties.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="Jude.c12.p19"><s sid="54" id="Jude.c12.s54">Jude found himself speaking out loud, holding conversations with them as it were, like an actor in a melodrama who apostrophizes the audience on the other side of the footlights; till he suddenly ceased with a start at his absurdity.</s> <s sid="55" id="Jude.c12.s55">Perhaps those incoherent words of the wanderer were heard within the walls by some student or thinker over his lamp; and he may have raised his head, and wondered what voice it was, and what it betokened.</s> <s sid="56" id="Jude.c12.s56">Jude now perceived that, so far as solid flesh went, he had the whole aged city to himself with the exception of a belated townsman here and there, and that he seemed to be catching a cold.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="Jude.c12.p20"><s sid="57" id="Jude.c12.s57">A voice reached him out of the shade; a real and local voice:</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="Jude.c12.p22"><s sid="60" id="Jude.c12.s60">It came from a policeman who had been observing Jude without the latter observing him.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="Jude.c12.p23" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="Jude.c12.s61">Jude went home and to bed, after reading up a little about these men and their several messages to the world from a book or two that he had brought with him concerning the sons of the university.</s> <s sid="62" id="Jude.c12.s62">As he drew towards sleep various memorable words of theirs that he had just been conning seemed spoken by them in muttering utterances; some audible, some unintelligible to him.</s> <s sid="63" id="Jude.c12.s63">One of the spectres (who afterwards mourned Christminster as <qs/>"the home of lost causes,"<qe/> though Jude did not remember this) was now apostrophizing her thus:</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="Jude.c14.p1"><s sid="1" id="Jude.c14.s1">But under the various deterrent influences Jude's instinct was to approach her timidly, and the next Sunday he went to the morning service in the Cathedral church of Cardinal College to gain a further view of her, for he had found that she frequently attended there.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Jude.c14.p2"><s sid="2" id="Jude.c14.s2">She did not come, and he awaited her in the afternoon, which was finer.</s> <s sid="3" id="Jude.c14.s3">He knew that if she came at all she would approach the building along the eastern side of the great green quadrangle from which it was accessible, and he stood in a corner while the bell was going.</s> <s sid="4" id="Jude.c14.s4">A few minutes before the hour for service she appeared as one of the figures walking along under the college walls, and at sight of her he advanced up the side opposite, and followed her into the building, more than ever glad that he had not as yet revealed himself.</s> <s sid="5" id="Jude.c14.s5">To see her, and to be himself unseen and unknown, was enough for him at present.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Jude.c14.p3"><s sid="6" id="Jude.c14.s6">He lingered awhile in the vestibule, and the service was some way advanced when he was put into a seat.</s> <s sid="7" id="Jude.c14.s7">It was a louring, mournful, still afternoon, when a religion of some sort seems a necessity to ordinary practical men, and not only a luxury of the emotional and leisured classes.</s> <s sid="8" id="Jude.c14.s8">In the dim light and the baffling glare of the clerestory windows he could discern the opposite worshippers indistinctly only, but he saw that Sue was among them.</s> <s sid="9" id="Jude.c14.s9">He had not long discovered the exact seat that she occupied when the chanting of the 119th Psalm in which the choir was engaged reached its second part, _In quo corriget_, the organ changing to a pathetic Gregorian tune as the singers gave forth:</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Jude.c14.p4"><s sid="10" id="Jude.c14.s10">Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Jude.c14.p5"><s sid="11" id="Jude.c14.s11">It was the very question that was engaging Jude's attention at this moment.</s> <s sid="12" id="Jude.c14.s12">What a wicked worthless fellow he had been to give vent as he had done to an animal passion for a woman, and allow it to lead to such disastrous consequences; then to think of putting an end to himself; then to go recklessly and get drunk.</s> <s sid="13" id="Jude.c14.s13">The great waves of pedal music tumbled round the choir, and, nursed on the supernatural as he had been, it is not wonderful that he could hardly believe that the psalm was not specially set by some regardful Providence for this moment of his first entry into the solemn building.</s> <s sid="14" id="Jude.c14.s14">And yet it was the ordinary psalm for the twenty-fourth evening of the month.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Jude.c14.p6"><s sid="15" id="Jude.c14.s15">The girl for whom he was beginning to nourish an extraordinary tenderness was at this time ensphered by the same harmonies as those which floated into his ears; and the thought was a delight to him.</s> <s sid="16" id="Jude.c14.s16">She was probably a frequenter of this place, and, steeped body and soul in church sentiment as she must be by occupation and habit, had, no doubt, much in common with him.</s> <s sid="17" id="Jude.c14.s17">To an impressionable and lonely young man the consciousness of having at last found anchorage for his thoughts, which promised to supply both social and spiritual possibilities, was like the dew of Hermon, and he remained throughout the service in a sustaining atmosphere of ecstasy.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Jude.c14.p7"><s sid="18" id="Jude.c14.s18">Though he was loth to suspect it, some people might have said to him that the atmosphere blew as distinctly from Cyprus as from Galilee.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Jude.c14.p8"><s sid="19" id="Jude.c14.s19">Jude waited till she had left her seat and passed under the screen before he himself moved.</s> <s sid="20" id="Jude.c14.s20">She did not look towards him, and by the time he reached the door she was half-way down the broad path.</s> <s sid="21" id="Jude.c14.s21">Being dressed up in his Sunday suit he was inclined to follow her and reveal himself.</s> <s sid="22" id="Jude.c14.s22">But he was not quite ready; and, alas, ought he to do so with the kind of feeling that was awakening in him?</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Jude.c14.p9" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="Jude.c14.s23">For though it had seemed to have an ecclesiastical basis during the service, and he had persuaded himself that such was the case, he could not altogether be blind to the real nature of the magnetism.</s> <s sid="24" id="Jude.c14.s24">She was such a stranger that the kinship was affectation, and he said, <qs/>"It can't be!</s> <s sid="25" id="Jude.c14.s25">I, a man with a wife, must not know her!"<qe/></s> <s sid="26" id="Jude.c14.s26">Still Sue WAS his own kin, and the fact of his having a wife, even though she was not in evidence in this hemisphere, might be a help in one sense.</s> <s sid="27" id="Jude.c14.s27">It would put all thought of a tender wish on his part out of Sue's mind, and make her intercourse with him free and fearless.</s> <s sid="28" id="Jude.c14.s28">It was with some heartache that he saw how little he cared for the freedom and fearlessness that would result in her from such knowledge.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Jude.c14.p10"><s sid="29" id="Jude.c14.s29">Some little time before the date of this service in the cathedral the pretty, liquid-eyed, light-footed young woman Sue Bridehead had an afternoon's holiday, and leaving the ecclesiastical establishment in which she not only assisted but lodged, took a walk into the country with a book in her hand.</s> <s sid="30" id="Jude.c14.s30">It was one of those cloudless days which sometimes occur in Wessex and elsewhere between days of cold and wet, as if intercalated by caprice of the weather-god.</s> <s sid="31" id="Jude.c14.s31">She went along for a mile or two until she came to much higher ground than that of the city she had left behind her.</s> <s sid="32" id="Jude.c14.s32">The road passed between green fields, and coming to a stile Sue paused there, to finish the page she was reading, and then looked back at the towers and domes and pinnacles new and old.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Jude.c14.p11" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="Jude.c14.s33">On the other side of the stile, in the footpath, she beheld a foreigner with black hair and a sallow face, sitting on the grass beside a large square board whereon were fixed, as closely as they could stand, a number of plaster statuettes, some of them bronzed, which he was re-arranging before proceeding with them on his way.</s> <s sid="34" id="Jude.c14.s34">They were in the main reduced copies of ancient marbles, and comprised divinities of a very different character from those the girl was accustomed to see portrayed, among them being a Venus of standard pattern, a Diana, and, of the other sex, Apollo, Bacchus, and Mars.</s> <s sid="35" id="Jude.c14.s35">Though the figures were many yards away from her the south-west sun brought them out so brilliantly against the green herbage that she could discern their contours with luminous distinctness; and being almost in a line between herself and the church towers of the city they awoke in her an oddly foreign and contrasting set of ideas by comparison.</s> <s sid="36" id="Jude.c14.s36">The man rose, and, seeing her, politely took off his cap, and cried <qs/>"I-i-i-mages!"<qe/> in an accent that agreed with his appearance.</s> <s sid="37" id="Jude.c14.s37">In a moment he dexterously lifted upon his knee the great board with its assembled notabilities divine and human, and raised it to the top of his head, bringing them on to her and resting the board on the stile.</s> <s sid="38" id="Jude.c14.s38">First he offered her his smaller wares--the busts of kings and queens, then a minstrel, then a winged Cupid.</s> <s sid="39" id="Jude.c14.s39">She shook her head.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Jude.c14.p12" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="Jude.c14.s40"><qs/>"How much are these two?"<qe/> she said, touching with her finger the Venus and the Apollo--the largest figures on the tray.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="Jude.c14.p13"><s sid="41" id="Jude.c14.s41">He said she should have them for ten shillings.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Jude.c14.p14" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="Jude.c14.s42"><qs/>"I cannot afford that,"<qe/> said Sue.</s> <s sid="43" id="Jude.c14.s43">She offered considerably less, and to her surprise the image-man drew them from their wire stay and handed them over the stile.</s> <s sid="44" id="Jude.c14.s44">She clasped them as treasures.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Jude.c14.p15"><s sid="45" id="Jude.c14.s45">When they were paid for, and the man had gone, she began to be concerned as to what she should do with them.</s> <s sid="46" id="Jude.c14.s46">They seemed so very large now that they were in her possession, and so very naked.</s> <s sid="47" id="Jude.c14.s47">Being of a nervous temperament she trembled at her enterprise.</s> <s sid="48" id="Jude.c14.s48">When she handled them the white pipeclay came off on her gloves and jacket.</s> <s sid="49" id="Jude.c14.s49">After carrying them along a little way openly an idea came to her, and, pulling some huge burdock leaves, parsley, and other rank growths from the hedge, she wrapped up her burden as well as she could in these, so that what she carried appeared to be an enormous armful of green stuff gathered by a zealous lover of nature.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Jude.c14.p16" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="Jude.c14.s50"><qs/>"Well, anything is better than those everlasting church fallals!"<qe/> she said.</s> <s sid="51" id="Jude.c14.s51">But she was still in a trembling state, and seemed almost to wish she had not bought the figures.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Jude.c14.p17"><s sid="52" id="Jude.c14.s52">Occasionally peeping inside the leaves to see that Venus's arm was not broken, she entered with her heathen load into the most Christian city in the country by an obscure street running parallel to the main one, and round a corner to the side door of the establishment to which she was attached.</s> <s sid="53" id="Jude.c14.s53">Her purchases were taken straight up to her own chamber, and she at once attempted to lock them in a box that was her very own property; but finding them too cumbersome she wrapped them in large sheets of brown paper, and stood them on the floor in a corner.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="Jude.c14.p18"><s sid="54" id="Jude.c14.s54">The mistress of the house, Miss Fontover, was an elderly lady in spectacles, dressed almost like an abbess; a dab at Ritual, as become one of her business, and a worshipper at the ceremonial church of St.</s> <s sid="55" id="Jude.c14.s55">Silas, in the suburb of Beersheba before-mentioned, which Jude also had begun to attend.</s> <s sid="56" id="Jude.c14.s56">She was the daughter of a clergyman in reduced circumstances, and at his death, which had occurred several years before this date, she boldly avoided penury by taking over a little shop of church requisites and developing it to its present creditable proportions.</s> <s sid="57" id="Jude.c14.s57">She wore a cross and beads round her neck as her only ornament, and knew the Christian Year by heart.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="Jude.c14.p19"><s sid="58" id="Jude.c14.s58">She now came to call Sue to tea, and, finding that the girl did not respond for a moment, entered the room just as the other was hastily putting a string round each parcel.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="Jude.c14.p20" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="Jude.c14.s59"><qs/>"Something you have been buying, Miss Bridehead?"<qe/> she asked, regarding the enwrapped objects.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="Jude.c14.p21" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="Jude.c14.s60"><qs/>"Yes--just something to ornament my room,"<qe/> said Sue.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="Jude.c14.p22" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="Jude.c14.s61"><qs/>"Well, I should have thought I had put enough here already,"<qe/> said Miss Fontover, looking round at the Gothic-framed prints of saints, the Church-text scrolls, and other articles which, having become too stale to sell, had been used to furnish this obscure chamber.</s> <s sid="62" id="Jude.c14.s62"><qs/>"What is it?</s> <s sid="63" id="Jude.c14.s63">How bulky!"<qe/></s> <s sid="64" id="Jude.c14.s64">She tore a little hole, about as big as a wafer, in the brown paper, and tried to peep in.</s> <s sid="65" id="Jude.c14.s65"><qs/>"Why, statuary?</s> <s sid="66" id="Jude.c14.s66">Two figures?</s> <s sid="67" id="Jude.c14.s67">Where did you get them?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="Jude.c14.p29"><s sid="76" id="Jude.c14.s76">These little obstacles to the indulgence of what had been the merest passing fancy created in Sue a great zest for unpacking her objects and looking at them; and at bedtime, when she was sure of being undisturbed, she unrobed the divinities in comfort.</s> <s sid="77" id="Jude.c14.s77">Placing the pair of figures on the chest of drawers, a candle on each side of them, she withdrew to the bed, flung herself down thereon, and began reading a book she had taken from her box, which Miss Fontover knew nothing of.</s> <s sid="78" id="Jude.c14.s78">It was a volume of Gibbon, and she read the chapter dealing with the reign of Julian the Apostate.</s> <s sid="79" id="Jude.c14.s79">Occasionally she looked up at the statuettes, which appeared strange and out of place, there happening to be a Calvary print hanging between them, and, as if the scene suggested the action, she at length jumped up and withdrew another book from her box--a volume of verse--and turned to the familiar poem--</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="Jude.c14.p32"><s sid="84" id="Jude.c14.s84">She was of an age which usually sleeps soundly, yet to-night she kept waking up, and every time she opened her eyes there was enough diffused light from the street to show her the white plaster figures, standing on the chest of drawers in odd contrast to their environment of text and martyr, and the Gothic-framed Crucifix-picture that was only discernible now as a Latin cross, the figure thereon being obscured by the shades.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Jude.c15.p2"><s sid="4" id="Jude.c15.s4">The next time that he saw her was when he was on a ladder executing a job of this sort inside one of the churches.</s> <s sid="5" id="Jude.c15.s5">There was a short morning service, and when the parson entered Jude came down from his ladder, and sat with the half-dozen people forming the congregation, till the prayer should be ended, and he could resume his tapping.</s> <s sid="6" id="Jude.c15.s6">He did not observe till the service was half over that one of the women was Sue, who had perforce accompanied the elderly Miss Fontover thither.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Jude.c15.p3"><s sid="7" id="Jude.c15.s7">Jude sat watching her pretty shoulders, her easy, curiously nonchalant risings and sittings, and her perfunctory genuflexions, and thought what a help such an Anglican would have been to him in happier circumstances.</s> <s sid="8" id="Jude.c15.s8">It was not so much his anxiety to get on with his work that made him go up to it immediately the worshipers began to take their leave: it was that he dared not, in this holy spot, confront the woman who was beginning to influence him in such an indescribable manner.</s> <s sid="9" id="Jude.c15.s9">Those three enormous reasons why he must not attempt intimate acquaintance with Sue Bridehead, now that his interest in her had shown itself to be unmistakably of a sexual kind, loomed as stubbornly as ever.</s> <s sid="10" id="Jude.c15.s10">But it was also obvious that man could not live by work alone; that the particular man Jude, at any rate, wanted something to love.</s> <s sid="11" id="Jude.c15.s11">Some men would have rushed incontinently to her, snatched the pleasure of easy friendship which she could hardly refuse, and have left the rest to chance.</s> <s sid="12" id="Jude.c15.s12">Not so Jude--at first.</s> </p>

<title>I</title>

<p pid="1" id="Jude.c19.p1"><s sid="1" id="Jude.c19.s1">It was a new idea--the ecclesiastical and altruistic life as distinct from the intellectual and emulative life.</s> <s sid="2" id="Jude.c19.s2">A man could preach and do good to his fellow-creatures without taking double-firsts in the schools of Christminster, or having anything but ordinary knowledge.</s> <s sid="3" id="Jude.c19.s3">The old fancy which had led on to the culminating vision of the bishopric had not been an ethical or theological enthusiasm at all, but a mundane ambition masquerading in a surplice.</s> <s sid="4" id="Jude.c19.s4">He feared that his whole scheme had degenerated to, even though it might not have originated in, a social unrest which had no foundation in the nobler instincts; which was purely an artificial product of civilization.</s> <s sid="5" id="Jude.c19.s5">There were thousands of young men on the same self-seeking track at the present moment.</s> <s sid="6" id="Jude.c19.s6">The sensual hind who ate, drank, and lived carelessly with his wife through the days of his vanity was a more likable being than he.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Jude.c19.p2"><s sid="7" id="Jude.c19.s7">But to enter the Church in such an unscholarly way that he could not in any probability rise to a higher grade through all his career than that of the humble curate wearing his life out in an obscure village or city slum--that might have a touch of goodness and greatness in it; that might be true religion, and a purgatorial course worthy of being followed by a remorseful man.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Jude.c19.p3"><s sid="8" id="Jude.c19.s8">The favourable light in which this new thought showed itself by contrast with his foregone intentions cheered Jude, as he sat there, shabby and lonely; and it may be said to have given, during the next few days, the _coup de grace_ to his intellectual career--a career which had extended over the greater part of a dozen years.</s> <s sid="9" id="Jude.c19.s9">He did nothing, however, for some long stagnant time to advance his new desire, occupying himself with little local jobs in putting up and lettering headstones about the neighbouring villages, and submitting to be regarded as a social failure, a returned purchase, by the half-dozen or so of farmers and other country-people who condescended to nod to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Jude.c19.p4"><s sid="10" id="Jude.c19.s10">The human interest of the new intention--and a human interest is indispensable to the most spiritual and self-sacrificing--was created by a letter from Sue, bearing a fresh postmark.</s> <s sid="11" id="Jude.c19.s11">She evidently wrote with anxiety, and told very little about her own doings, more than that she had passed some sort of examination for a Queen's Scholarship, and was going to enter a training college at Melchester to complete herself for the vocation she had chosen, partly by his influence.</s> <s sid="12" id="Jude.c19.s12">There was a theological college at Melchester; Melchester was a quiet and soothing place, almost entirely ecclesiastical in its tone; a spot where worldly learning and intellectual smartness had no establishment; where the altruistic feeling that he did possess would perhaps be more highly estimated than a brilliancy which he did not.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Jude.c19.p5"><s sid="13" id="Jude.c19.s13">As it would be necessary that he should continue for a time to work at his trade while reading up Divinity, which he had neglected at Christminster for the ordinary classical grind, what better course for him than to get employment at the further city, and pursue this plan of reading?</s> <s sid="14" id="Jude.c19.s14">That his excessive human interest in the new place was entirely of Sue's making, while at the same time Sue was to be regarded even less than formerly as proper to create it, had an ethical contradictoriness to which he was not blind.</s> <s sid="15" id="Jude.c19.s15">But that much he conceded to human frailty, and hoped to learn to love her only as a friend and kinswoman.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Jude.c19.p6"><s sid="16" id="Jude.c19.s16">He considered that he might so mark out his coming years as to begin his ministry at the age of thirty--an age which much attracted him as being that of his exemplar when he first began to teach in Galilee.</s> <s sid="17" id="Jude.c19.s17">This would allow him plenty of time for deliberate study, and for acquiring capital by his trade to help his aftercourse of keeping the necessary terms at a theological college.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Jude.c24.p2"><s sid="3" id="Jude.c24.s3">A glance at the place and its accessories was almost enough to reveal that the schoolmaster's plans and dreams so long indulged in had been abandoned for some new dream with which neither the Church nor literature had much in common.</s> <s sid="4" id="Jude.c24.s4">Essentially an unpractical man, he was now bent on making and saving money for a practical purpose--that of keeping a wife, who, if she chose, might conduct one of the girls' schools adjoining his own; for which purpose he had advised her to go into training, since she would not marry him offhand.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Jude.c24.p3"><s sid="5" id="Jude.c24.s5">About the time that Jude was removing from Marygreen to Melchester, and entering on adventures at the latter place with Sue, the schoolmaster was settling down in the new school-house at Shaston.</s> <s sid="6" id="Jude.c24.s6">All the furniture being fixed, the books shelved, and the nails driven, he had begun to sit in his parlour during the dark winter nights and re-attempt some of his old studies--one branch of which had included Roman-Britannic antiquities--an unremunerative labour for a national school-master but a subject, that, after his abandonment of the university scheme, had interested him as being a comparatively unworked mine; practicable to those who, like himself, had lived in lonely spots where these remains were abundant, and were seen to compel inferences in startling contrast to accepted views on the civilization of that time.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Jude.c24.p4"><s sid="7" id="Jude.c24.s7">A resumption of this investigation was the outward and apparent hobby of Phillotson at present--his ostensible reason for going alone into fields where causeways, dykes, and tumuli abounded, or shutting himself up in his house with a few urns, tiles, and mosaics he had collected, instead of calling round upon his new neighbours, who for their part had showed themselves willing enough to be friendly with him.</s> <s sid="8" id="Jude.c24.s8">But it was not the real, or the whole, reason, after all.</s> <s sid="9" id="Jude.c24.s9">Thus on a particular evening in the month, when it had grown quite late--to near midnight, indeed--and the light of his lamp, shining from his window at a salient angle of the hill-top town over infinite miles of valley westward, announced as by words a place and person given over to study, he was not exactly studying.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Jude.c24.p7"><s sid="23" id="Jude.c24.s23">He opened another drawer, and found therein an envelope, from which he drew a photograph of Sue as a child, long before he had known her, standing under trellis-work with a little basket in her hand.</s> <s sid="24" id="Jude.c24.s24">There was another of her as a young woman, her dark eyes and hair making a very distinct and attractive picture of her, which just disclosed, too, the thoughtfulness that lay behind her lighter moods.</s> <s sid="25" id="Jude.c24.s25">It was a duplicate of the one she had given Jude, and would have given to any man.</s> <s sid="26" id="Jude.c24.s26">Phillotson brought it half-way to his lips, but withdrew it in doubt at her perplexing phrases: ultimately kissing the dead pasteboard with all the passionateness, and more than all the devotion, of a young man of eighteen.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Jude.c24.p8"><s sid="27" id="Jude.c24.s27">The schoolmaster's was an unhealthy-looking, old-fashioned face, rendered more old-fashioned by his style of shaving.</s> <s sid="28" id="Jude.c24.s28">A certain gentlemanliness had been imparted to it by nature, suggesting an inherent wish to do rightly by all.</s> <s sid="29" id="Jude.c24.s29">His speech was a little slow, but his tones were sincere enough to make his hesitation no defect.</s> <s sid="30" id="Jude.c24.s30">His greying hair was curly, and radiated from a point in the middle of his crown.</s> <s sid="31" id="Jude.c24.s31">There were four lines across his forehead, and he only wore spectacles when reading at night.</s> <s sid="32" id="Jude.c24.s32">It was almost certainly a renunciation forced upon him by his academic purpose, rather than a distaste for women, which had hitherto kept him from closing with one of the sex in matrimony.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Jude.c24.p9"><s sid="33" id="Jude.c24.s33">Such silent proceedings as those of this evening were repeated many and oft times when he was not under the eye of the boys, whose quick and penetrating regard would frequently become almost intolerable to the self-conscious master in his present anxious care for Sue, making him, in the grey hours of morning, dread to meet anew the gimlet glances, lest they should read what the dream within him was.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Jude.c24.p10"><s sid="34" id="Jude.c24.s34">He had honourably acquiesced in Sue's announced wish that he was not often to visit her at the training school; but at length, his patience being sorely tried, he set out one Saturday afternoon to pay her an unexpected call.</s> <s sid="35" id="Jude.c24.s35">There the news of her departure--expulsion as it might almost have been considered--was flashed upon him without warning or mitigation as he stood at the door expecting in a few minutes to behold her face; and when he turned away he could hardly see the road before him.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="Jude.c25.p52"><s sid="114" id="Jude.c25.s114">In the carriage Jude took from his pocket his extra little wedding-present, which turned out to be two or three yards of white tulle, which he threw over her bonnet and all, as a veil.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Jude.c29.p2"><s sid="2" id="Jude.c29.s2">From whose foundation first such strange reports arise,</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Jude.c29.p3" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="Jude.c29.s3">(as Drayton sang it), was, and is, in itself the city of a dream.</s> <s sid="4" id="Jude.c29.s4">Vague imaginings of its castle, its three mints, its magnificent apsidal abbey, the chief glory of South Wessex, its twelve churches, its shrines, chantries, hospitals, its gabled freestone mansions--all now ruthlessly swept away--throw the visitor, even against his will, into a pensive melancholy, which the stimulating atmosphere and limitless landscape around him can scarcely dispel.</s> <s sid="5" id="Jude.c29.s5">The spot was the burial-place of a king and a queen, of abbots and abbesses, saints and bishops, knights and squires.</s> <s sid="6" id="Jude.c29.s6">The bones of King Edward <qs/>"the Martyr,"<qe/> carefully removed hither for holy preservation, brought Shaston a renown which made it the resort of pilgrims from every part of Europe, and enabled it to maintain a reputation extending far beyond English shores.</s> <s sid="7" id="Jude.c29.s7">To this fair creation of the great Middle-Age the Dissolution was, as historians tell us, the death-knell.</s> <s sid="8" id="Jude.c29.s8">With the destruction of the enormous abbey the whole place collapsed in a general ruin: the Martyr's bones met with the fate of the sacred pile that held them, and not a stone is now left to tell where they lie.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Jude.c29.p4"><s sid="9" id="Jude.c29.s9">The natural picturesqueness and singularity of the town still remain; but strange to say these qualities, which were noted by many writers in ages when scenic beauty is said to have been unappreciated, are passed over in this, and one of the queerest and quaintest spots in England stands virtually unvisited to-day.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Jude.c29.p5"><s sid="10" id="Jude.c29.s10">It has a unique position on the summit of a steep and imposing scarp, rising on the north, south, and west sides of the borough out of the deep alluvial Vale of Blackmoor, the view from the Castle Green over three counties of verdant pasture--South, Mid, and Nether Wessex--being as sudden a surprise to the unexpectant traveller's eyes as the medicinal air is to his lungs.</s> <s sid="11" id="Jude.c29.s11">Impossible to a railway, it can best be reached on foot, next best by light vehicles; and it is hardly accessible to these but by a sort of isthmus on the north-east, that connects it with the high chalk table-land on that side.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Jude.c29.p6"><s sid="12" id="Jude.c29.s12">Such is, and such was, the now world-forgotten Shaston or Palladour.</s> <s sid="13" id="Jude.c29.s13">Its situation rendered water the great want of the town; and within living memory, horses, donkeys and men may have been seen toiling up the winding ways to the top of the height, laden with tubs and barrels filled from the wells beneath the mountain, and hawkers retailing their contents at the price of a halfpenny a bucketful.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Jude.c29.p7"><s sid="14" id="Jude.c29.s14">This difficulty in the water supply, together with two other odd facts, namely, that the chief graveyard slopes up as steeply as a roof behind the church, and that in former times the town passed through a curious period of corruption, conventual and domestic, gave rise to the saying that Shaston was remarkable for three consolations to man, such as the world afforded not elsewhere.</s> <s sid="15" id="Jude.c29.s15">It was a place where the churchyard lay nearer heaven than the church steeple, where beer was more plentiful than water, and where there were more wanton women than honest wives and maids.</s> <s sid="16" id="Jude.c29.s16">It is also said that after the Middle Ages the inhabitants were too poor to pay their priests, and hence were compelled to pull down their churches, and refrain altogether from the public worship of God; a necessity which they bemoaned over their cups in the settles of their inns on Sunday afternoons.</s> <s sid="17" id="Jude.c29.s17">In those days the Shastonians were apparently not without a sense of humour.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Jude.c29.p8"><s sid="18" id="Jude.c29.s18">There was another peculiarity--this a modern one--which Shaston appeared to owe to its site.</s> <s sid="19" id="Jude.c29.s19">It was the resting-place and headquarters of the proprietors of wandering vans, shows, shooting-galleries, and other itinerant concerns, whose business lay largely at fairs and markets.</s> <s sid="20" id="Jude.c29.s20">As strange wild birds are seen assembled on some lofty promontory, meditatively pausing for longer flights, or to return by the course they followed thither, so here, in this cliff-town, stood in stultified silence the yellow and green caravans bearing names not local, as if surprised by a change in the landscape so violent as to hinder their further progress; and here they usually remained all the winter till they turned to seek again their old tracks in the following spring.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Jude.c29.p9"><s sid="21" id="Jude.c29.s21">It was to this breezy and whimsical spot that Jude ascended from the nearest station for the first time in his life about four o'clock one afternoon, and entering on the summit of the peak after a toilsome climb, passed the first houses of the aerial town; and drew towards the school-house.</s> <s sid="22" id="Jude.c29.s22">The hour was too early; the pupils were still in school, humming small, like a swarm of gnats; and he withdrew a few steps along Abbey Walk, whence he regarded the spot which fate had made the home of all he loved best in the world.</s> <s sid="23" id="Jude.c29.s23">In front of the schools, which were extensive and stone-built, grew two enormous beeches with smooth mouse-coloured trunks, as such trees will only grow on chalk uplands.</s> <s sid="24" id="Jude.c29.s24">Within the mullioned and transomed windows he could see the black, brown, and flaxen crowns of the scholars over the sills, and to pass the time away he walked down to the level terrace where the abbey gardens once had spread, his heart throbbing in spite of him.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Jude.c29.p10"><s sid="25" id="Jude.c29.s25">Unwilling to enter till the children were dismissed he remained here till young voices could be heard in the open air, and girls in white pinafores over red and blue frocks appeared dancing along the paths which the abbess, prioress, subprioress, and fifty nuns had demurely paced three centuries earlier.</s> <s sid="26" id="Jude.c29.s26">Retracing his steps he found that he had waited too long, and that Sue had gone out into the town at the heels of the last scholar, Mr. Phillotson having been absent all the afternoon at a teachers' meeting at Shottsford.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Jude.c29.p11"><s sid="27" id="Jude.c29.s27">Jude went into the empty schoolroom and sat down, the girl who was sweeping the floor having informed him that Mrs. Phillotson would be back again in a few minutes.</s> <s sid="28" id="Jude.c29.s28">A piano stood near--actually the old piano that Phillotson had possessed at Marygreen--and though the dark afternoon almost prevented him seeing the notes Jude touched them in his humble way, and could not help modulating into the hymn which had so affected him in the previous week.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Jude.c29.p12"><s sid="29" id="Jude.c29.s29">A figure moved behind him, and thinking it was still the girl with the broom Jude took no notice, till the person came close and laid her fingers lightly upon his bass hand.</s> <s sid="30" id="Jude.c29.s30">The imposed hand was a little one he seemed to know, and he turned.</s> </p>
