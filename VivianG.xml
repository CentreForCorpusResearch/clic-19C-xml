<title>CHAPTER I</title>

<p pid="1" id="VivianG.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="VivianG.c1.s1">We are not aware that the infancy of Vivian Grey was distinguished by any extraordinary incident.</s> <s sid="2" id="VivianG.c1.s2">The solicitude of the most affectionate of mothers, and the care of the most attentive of nurses, did their best to injure an excellent constitution.</s> <s sid="3" id="VivianG.c1.s3">But Vivian was an only child, and these exertions were therefore excusable.</s> <s sid="4" id="VivianG.c1.s4">For the first five years of his life, with his curly locks and his fancy dress, he was the pride of his own and the envy of all neighbouring establishments; but, in process of time, the spirit of boyism began to develop itself, and Vivian not only would brush his hair straight and rebel against his nurse, but actually insisted upon being--breeched!</s> <s sid="5" id="VivianG.c1.s5">At this crisis it was discovered that he had been spoiled, and it was determined that he should be sent to school.</s> <s sid="6" id="VivianG.c1.s6">Mr. Grey observed, also, that the child was nearly ten years old, and did not know his alphabet, and Mrs. Grey remarked that he was getting ugly.</s> <s sid="7" id="VivianG.c1.s7">The fate of Vivian was decided.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="VivianG.c1.p2" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="VivianG.c1.s8"><qs/>"I am told, my dear,"<qe/><sls/> observed Mrs. Grey, one day after dinner to her husband, <sle/><qs/>"I am told, my dear, that Dr. Flummery's would do very well for Vivian.</s> <s sid="9" id="VivianG.c1.s9">Nothing can exceed the attention which is paid to the pupils.</s> <s sid="10" id="VivianG.c1.s10">There are sixteen young ladies, all the daughters of clergymen, merely to attend to the morals and the linen; terms moderate:</s> <s sid="11" id="VivianG.c1.s11">100 guineas per annum, for all under six years of age, and few extras, only for fencing, pure milk, and the guitar.</s> <s sid="12" id="VivianG.c1.s12">Mrs. Metcalfe has both her boys there, and she says their progress is astonishing!</s> <s sid="13" id="VivianG.c1.s13">Percy Metcalfe, she assures me, was quite as backward as Vivian; indeed, backwarder; and so was Dudley, who was taught at home on the new system, by a pictorial alphabet, and who persisted to the last, notwithstanding all the exertions of Miss Barrett, in spelling A-P-E, monkey, merely because over the word there was a monster munching an apple."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="VivianG.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="VivianG.c1.s14"><qs/>"And quite right in the child, my dear.</s> <s sid="15" id="VivianG.c1.s15">Pictorial alphabet! pictorial fool's head!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="VivianG.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="VivianG.c1.s16"><qs/>"But what do you say to Flummery's, Horace?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="VivianG.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="VivianG.c1.s17"><qs/>"My dear, do what you like.</s> <s sid="18" id="VivianG.c1.s18">I never trouble myself, you know, about these matters;"<qe/> and Mr. Grey refreshed himself, after this domestic attack, with a glass of claret.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="VivianG.c1.p6"><s sid="19" id="VivianG.c1.s19">Mr. Grey was a gentleman who had succeeded, when the heat of youth was over, to the enjoyment of a life estate of some two thousand a year.</s> <s sid="20" id="VivianG.c1.s20">He was a man of lettered tastes, and had hailed with no slight pleasure his succession to a fortune which, though limited in its duration, was still a great thing for a young lounger about town, not only with no profession, but with a mind unfitted for every species of business.</s> <s sid="21" id="VivianG.c1.s21">Grey, to the astonishment of his former friends, the wits, made an excellent domestic match; and, leaving the whole management of his household to his lady, felt himself as independent in his magnificent library as if he had never ceased to be that true freeman, A MAN OF CHAMBERS.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="VivianG.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="VivianG.c1.s22">The young Vivian had not, by the cares which fathers are always heirs to, yet reminded his parent that children were anything else but playthings.</s> <s sid="23" id="VivianG.c1.s23">The intercourse between father and son was, of course, extremely limited; for Vivian was, as yet, the mother's child; Mr. Grey's parental duties being confined to giving his son a daily glass of claret, pulling his ears with all the awkwardness of literary affection, and trusting to God <qs/>"that the urchin would never scribble."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="VivianG.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="VivianG.c1.s24"><qs/>"I won't go to school, mamma,"<qe/> bawled Vivian.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="VivianG.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="VivianG.c1.s25"><qs/>"But you must, my love,"<qe/><sss/> answered Mrs. Grey; <sse/><qs/>"all good boys go to school;"<qe/> and in the plenitude of a mother's love she tried to make her offspring's hair curl.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="VivianG.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="VivianG.c1.s26"><qs/>"I won't have my hair curl, mamma; the boys will laugh at me,"<qe/> rebawled the beauty.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="VivianG.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="VivianG.c1.s27"><qs/>"Now who could have told the child that?"<qe/> monologised mamma, with all a mamma's admiration.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="VivianG.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="VivianG.c1.s28"><qs/>"Charles Appleyard told me so; his hair curled, and the boys called him girl.</s> <s sid="29" id="VivianG.c1.s29">Papa! give me some more claret; I won't go to school."<qe/></s> </p></div>

<title>CHAPTER II</title>

<p pid="1" id="VivianG.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="VivianG.c2.s1">Three or four years passed over, and the mind of Vivian Grey astonishingly developed itself.</s> <s sid="2" id="VivianG.c2.s2">He had long ceased to wear frills, had broached the subject of boots three or four times, made a sad inroad during the holidays in Mr. Grey's bottle of claret, and was reported as having once sworn at the butler.</s> <s sid="3" id="VivianG.c2.s3">The young gentleman began also to hint, during every vacation, that the fellows at Flummery's were somewhat too small for his companionship, and (first bud of puppyism!) the former advocate of straight hair now expended a portion of his infant income in the purchase of Macassar, and began to cultivate his curls.</s> <s sid="4" id="VivianG.c2.s4">Mrs. Grey could not entertain for a moment the idea of her son's associating with children, the eldest of whom (to adopt his own account) was not above eight years old; so Flummery, it was determined, he should leave.</s> <s sid="5" id="VivianG.c2.s5">But where to go?</s> <s sid="6" id="VivianG.c2.s6">Mr. Grey was for Eton, but his lady was one of those women whom nothing in the world can persuade that a public school is anything else but a place where boys are roasted alive; and so with tears, and taunts, and supplications, the point of private education was conceded.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="VivianG.c2.p2"><s sid="7" id="VivianG.c2.s7">At length it was resolved that the only hope should remain at home a season, until some plan should be devised for the cultivation of his promising understanding.</s> <s sid="8" id="VivianG.c2.s8">During this year Vivian became a somewhat more constant intruder into the library than heretofore; and living so much among books, he was insensibly attracted to those silent companions, that speak so eloquently.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="VivianG.c2.p3"><s sid="9" id="VivianG.c2.s9">How far the character of the parent may influence the character of the child the metaphysician must decide.</s> <s sid="10" id="VivianG.c2.s10">Certainly the character of Vivian Grey underwent, at this period of his life, a sensible change.</s> <s sid="11" id="VivianG.c2.s11">Doubtless, constant communion with a mind highly refined, severely cultivated, and much experienced, cannot but produce a beneficial impression, even upon a mind formed and upon principles developed: how infinitely more powerful must the influence of such communion be upon a youthful heart, ardent, innocent, and unpractised!</s> <s sid="12" id="VivianG.c2.s12">As Vivian was not to figure in the microcosm of a public school, a place for which, from his temper, he was almost better fitted than any young genius whom the playing fields of Eton or the hills of Winton can remember, there was some difficulty in fixing upon his future Academus.</s> <s sid="13" id="VivianG.c2.s13">Mr. Grey's two axioms were, first, that no one so young as his son should settle in the metropolis, and that Vivian must consequently not have a private tutor; and, secondly, that all private schools were quite worthless; and, therefore, there was every probability of Vivian not receiving any education whatever.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="VivianG.c2.p4" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="VivianG.c2.s14">At length, an exception to axiom second started up in the establishment of Mr. Dallas.</s> <s sid="15" id="VivianG.c2.s15">This gentleman was a clergyman, a profound Grecian, and a poor man.</s> <s sid="16" id="VivianG.c2.s16">He had edited the Alcestis, and married his laundress; lost money by his edition, and his fellowship by his match.</s> <s sid="17" id="VivianG.c2.s17">In a few days the hall of Mr. Grey's London mansion was filled with all sorts of portmanteaus, trunks, and travelling cases, directed in a boy's sprawling hand to <qs/>"Vivian Grey, Esquire, at the Reverend Everard Dallas, Burnsley Vicarage, Hants."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="VivianG.c2.p5" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="VivianG.c2.s18"><qs/>"God bless you, my boy! write to your mother soon, and remember your Journal."<qe/></s> </p></div>

<title>CHAPTER III</title>

<p pid="1" id="VivianG.c3.p1"><s sid="1" id="VivianG.c3.s1">The rumour of the arrival of "a new fellow" circulated with rapidity through the inmates of Burnsley Vicarage, and about fifty young devils were preparing to quiz the newcomer, when the school-room door opened, and Mr. Dallas, accompanied by Vivian, entered.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="VivianG.c3.p2" type="speech"><s sid="2" id="VivianG.c3.s2"><qs/>"A dandy, by Jove!"<qe/> whispered St.</s> <s sid="3" id="VivianG.c3.s3">Leger Smith.</s> <s sid="4" id="VivianG.c3.s4"><qs/>"What a knowing set out!"<qe/> squeaked Johnson secundus.</s> <s sid="5" id="VivianG.c3.s5"><qs/>"Mammy-sick!"<qe/> growled Barlow primus.</s> <s sid="6" id="VivianG.c3.s6">This last exclamation was, however, a scandalous libel, for certainly no being ever stood in a pedagogue's presence with more perfect sang froid, and with a bolder front, than did, at this moment, Vivian Grey.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="VivianG.c3.p3" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="VivianG.c3.s7">One principle in Mr. Dallas's system was always to introduce a new-comer in school-hours.</s> <s sid="8" id="VivianG.c3.s8">He was thus carried immediately in medias res, and the curiosity of his co-mates being in a great degree satisfied at the time when that curiosity could not personally annoy him, the new-comer was, of course, much better prepared to make his way when the absence of the ruler became a signal for some oral communication with <qs/>"the arrival."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="VivianG.c3.p4" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="VivianG.c3.s9">However, in the present instance the young savages at Burnsley Vicarage had caught a Tartar; and in a very few days Vivian Grey was decidedly the most popular fellow in the school.</s> <s sid="10" id="VivianG.c3.s10">He was <qs/>"so dashing! so devilish good-tempered! so completely up to everything!"<qe/></s> <s sid="11" id="VivianG.c3.s11">The magnates of the land were certainly rather jealous of his success, but their very sneers bore witness to his popularity.</s> <s sid="12" id="VivianG.c3.s12"><qs/>"Cursed puppy,"<qe/> whispered St.</s> <s sid="13" id="VivianG.c3.s13">Leger Smith.</s> <s sid="14" id="VivianG.c3.s14"><qs/>"Thinks himself knowing,"<qe/> squeaked Johnson secundus.</s> <s sid="15" id="VivianG.c3.s15"><qs/>"Thinks himself witty,"<qe/> growled Barlow primus.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="VivianG.c3.p5" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="VivianG.c3.s16">Notwithstanding this cabal, days rolled on at Burnsley Vicarage only to witness the increase of Vivian's popularity.</s> <s sid="17" id="VivianG.c3.s17">Although more deficient than most of his own age in accurate classical attainments, he found himself, in talents and various acquirements, immeasurably their superior.</s> <s sid="18" id="VivianG.c3.s18">And singular is it that at school distinction in such points is ten thousand times more admired by the multitude than the most profound knowledge of Greek Metres, or the most accurate acquaintance with the value of Roman coins.</s> <s sid="19" id="VivianG.c3.s19">Vivian Grey's English verses and Vivian Grey's English themes were the subject of universal commendation.</s> <s sid="20" id="VivianG.c3.s20">Some young lads made copies of these productions, to enrich, at the Christmas holidays, their sisters' albums; while the whole school were scribbling embryo prize-poems, epics of twenty lines on "the Ruins of Paestum" and <qs/>"the Temple of Minerva;"<qe/><sss/> "Agrigentum," and <sse/><qs/>"the Cascade of Terni."<qe/></s> <s sid="21" id="VivianG.c3.s21">Vivian's productions at this time would probably have been rejected by the commonest twopenny publication about town, yet they turned the brain of the whole school; while fellows who were writing Latin Dissertations and Greek Odes, which might have made the fortune of the Classical Journal, were looked on by the multitude as as great dunderheads as themselves.</s> <s sid="22" id="VivianG.c3.s22">Such is the advantage which, even in this artificial world, everything that is genuine has over everything that is false and forced.</s> <s sid="23" id="VivianG.c3.s23">The dunderheads who wrote "good Latin" and "Attic Greek" did it by a process by means of which the youngest fellow in the school was conscious he could, if he chose, attain the same perfection.</s> <s sid="24" id="VivianG.c3.s24">Vivian Grey's verses were unlike anything which had yet appeared in the literary Annals of Burnsley Vicarage, and that which was quite novel was naturally thought quite excellent.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="VivianG.c3.p6"><s sid="25" id="VivianG.c3.s25">There is no place in the world where greater homage is paid to talent than an English school.</s> <s sid="26" id="VivianG.c3.s26">At a public school, indeed, if a youth of great talents be blessed with an amiable and generous disposition, he ought not to envy the Minister of England.</s> <s sid="27" id="VivianG.c3.s27">If any captain of Eton or praefect of Winchester be reading these pages, let him dispassionately consider in what situation of life he can rationally expect that it will be in his power to exercise such influence, to have such opportunities of obliging others, and be so confident of an affectionate and grateful return.</s> <s sid="28" id="VivianG.c3.s28">Aye, there's the rub!</s> <s sid="29" id="VivianG.c3.s29">Bitter thought! that gratitude should cease the moment we become men.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="VivianG.c3.p7"><s sid="30" id="VivianG.c3.s30">And sure I am that Vivian Grey was loved as ardently and as faithfully us you might expect from innocent young hearts.</s> <s sid="31" id="VivianG.c3.s31">His slight accomplishments were the standard of all perfection, his sayings were the soul of all good fellowship, and his opinion the guide in any crisis which occurred in the monotonous existence of the little commonwealth.</s> <s sid="32" id="VivianG.c3.s32">And time flew gaily on.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="VivianG.c3.p8"><s sid="33" id="VivianG.c3.s33">One winter evening, as Vivian, with some of his particular cronies, were standing round the school-room fire, they began, as all schoolboys do when it grows rather dark and they grow rather sentimental, to talk of HOME.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="VivianG.c3.p9" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="VivianG.c3.s34"><qs/>"Twelve weeks more,"<qe/><sss/> said Augustus Etherege; <sse/><qs/>"twelve weeks more, and we are free!</s> <s sid="35" id="VivianG.c3.s35">The glorious day should be celebrated."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="VivianG.c3.p10" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="VivianG.c3.s36"><qs/>"A feast, a feast!"<qe/> exclaimed Poynings.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="VivianG.c3.p11" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="VivianG.c3.s37"><qs/>"A feast is but the work of a night,"<qe/><sss/> said Vivian Grey; <sse/><qs/>"something more stirring for me!</s> <s sid="38" id="VivianG.c3.s38">What say you to private theatricals?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="VivianG.c3.p12" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="VivianG.c3.s39">The proposition was, of course, received with enthusiasm, and it was not until they had unanimously agreed to act that they universally remembered that acting was not allowed.</s> <s sid="40" id="VivianG.c3.s40">And then they consulted whether they should ask Dallas, and then they remembered that Dallas had been asked fifty times, and then they <qs/>"supposed they must give it up;"<qe/> and then Vivian Grey made a proposition which the rest were secretly sighing for, but which they were afraid to make themselves; he proposed that they should act without asking Dallas.</s> <s sid="41" id="VivianG.c3.s41"><qs/>"Well, then, we'll do it without asking him,"<qe/><sss/> said Vivian; <sse/><qs/>"nothing is allowed in this life, and everything is done: in town there is a thing called the French play, and that is not allowed, yet my aunt has got a private box there.</s> <s sid="42" id="VivianG.c3.s42">Trust me for acting, but what shall we perform?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="VivianG.c3.p13"><s sid="43" id="VivianG.c3.s43">This question was, as usual, the fruitful source of jarring opinions.</s> <s sid="44" id="VivianG.c3.s44">One proposed Othello, chiefly because it would be so easy to black a face with a burnt cork.</s> <s sid="45" id="VivianG.c3.s45">Another was for Hamlet, solely because he wanted to act the ghost, which he proposed doing in white shorts and a night-cap.</s> <s sid="46" id="VivianG.c3.s46">A third was for Julius Caesar, because the murder scene would be such fun.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="VivianG.c3.p14" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="VivianG.c3.s47"><qs/>"No! no!"<qe/><sls/> said Vivian, tired at these various and varying proposals, <sle/><qs/>"this will never do.</s> <s sid="48" id="VivianG.c3.s48">Out upon Tragedies; let's have a Comedy!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="VivianG.c3.p15" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="VivianG.c3.s49"><qs/>"A Comedy! a Comedy! oh! how delightful!"<qe/></s> </p></div>

<title>CHAPTER IV</title>

<p pid="1" id="VivianG.c4.p1"><s sid="1" id="VivianG.c4.s1">After an immense number of propositions, and an equal number of repetitions, Dr. Hoadley's bustling drama was fixed upon.</s> <s sid="2" id="VivianG.c4.s2">Vivian was to act Ranger, Augustus Etherege was to personate Clarinda, because he was a fair boy and always blushing; and the rest of the characters found able representatives.</s> <s sid="3" id="VivianG.c4.s3">Every half-holiday was devoted to rehearsals, and nothing could exceed the amusement and thorough fun which all the preparations elicited.</s> <s sid="4" id="VivianG.c4.s4">All went well; Vivian wrote a pathetic prologue and a witty epilogue.</s> <s sid="5" id="VivianG.c4.s5">Etherege got on capitally in the mask scene, and Poynings was quite perfect in Jack Maggot.</s> <s sid="6" id="VivianG.c4.s6">There was, of course, some difficulty in keeping all things in order, but then Vivian Grey was such an excellent manager! and then, with infinite tact, the said manager conciliated the Classics, for he allowed St.</s> <s sid="7" id="VivianG.c4.s7">Leger Smith to select a Greek motto, from the Andromache, for the front of the theatre; and Johnson secundus and Barlow primus were complimented by being allowed to act the chairmen.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="VivianG.c4.p2" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="VivianG.c4.s8">But alas! in the midst of all this sunshine, the seeds of discord and dissension were fast flourishing.</s> <s sid="9" id="VivianG.c4.s9">Mr. Dallas himself was always so absorbed in some freshly-imported German commentator that it was a fixed principle with him never to trouble himself with anything that concerned his pupils <qs/>"out of school hours."<qe/></s> <s sid="10" id="VivianG.c4.s10">The consequence was, that certain powers were necessarily delegated to a certain set of beings called USHERS.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="VivianG.c4.p3"><s sid="11" id="VivianG.c4.s11">The usherian rule had, however, always been comparatively light at Burnsley Vicarage, for the good Dallas, never for a moment entrusting the duties of tuition to a third person, engaged these deputies merely as a sort of police, to regulate the bodies, rather than the minds, of his youthful subjects.</s> <s sid="12" id="VivianG.c4.s12">One of the first principles of the new theory introduced into the establishment of Burnsley Vicarage by Mr. Vivian Grey was, that the ushers were to be considered by the boys as a species of upper servants; were to be treated with civility, certainly, as all servants are by gentlemen; but that no further attention was to be paid them, and that any fellow voluntarily conversing with an usher was to be cut dead by the whole school.</s> <s sid="13" id="VivianG.c4.s13">This pleasant arrangement was no secret to those whom it most immediately concerned, and, of course, rendered Vivian rather a favourite with them.</s> <s sid="14" id="VivianG.c4.s14">These men had not the tact to conciliate the boy, and were, notwithstanding, too much afraid of his influence in the school to attack him openly; so they waited with that patience which insulted beings can alone endure.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="VivianG.c25.p1"><s sid="1" id="VivianG.c25.s1">Vivian had duly acquainted the Marquess with the successful progress of his negotiations with their intended partisans, and Lord Carabas had himself conversed with them singly on the important subject.</s> <s sid="2" id="VivianG.c25.s2">It was thought proper, however, in this stage of the proceedings, that the persons interested should meet together; and so the two Lords, and Sir Berdmore, and Vivian were invited to dine with the Marquess alone, and in his library.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="VivianG.c25.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="VivianG.c25.s3">There was abundance of dumb waiters and other inventions by which the ease of the guests might be consulted, without risking even their secret looks to the gaze of liveried menials.</s> <s sid="4" id="VivianG.c25.s4">The Marquess' gentleman sat in an ante-chamber, in case human aid might be necessary, and everything, as his Lordship averred, was <qs/>"on the same system as the Cabinet Dinners."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="VivianG.c25.p4" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="VivianG.c25.s9">There certainly was every appearance that <qs/>"the great business,"<qe/> as the Marquess styled it, would not be very much advanced by the cabinet dinner at Chateau Desir.</s> <s sid="10" id="VivianG.c25.s10">For, in the first place, the table was laden <qs/>"with every delicacy of the season,"<qe/> and really, when a man is either going to talk sense, fight a duel, or make his will, nothing should be seen at dinner save cutlets and the lightest Bordeaux.</s> <s sid="11" id="VivianG.c25.s11">And, in the second place, it must be confessed, that when it came to the point of all the parties interested meeting, the Marquess' courage somewhat misgave him.</s> <s sid="12" id="VivianG.c25.s12">Not that any particular reason occurred to him which would have induced him to yield one jot of the theory of his sentiments, but the putting them in practice rather made him nervous.</s> <s sid="13" id="VivianG.c25.s13">In short, he was as convinced as ever that he was an ill-used man, of great influence and abilities; but then he remembered his agreeable sinecure and his dignified office, and he might not succeed.</s> <s sid="14" id="VivianG.c25.s14">The thought did not please.</s> </p>

that if the Grand Duke, moved by their entreaties, or seduced by their flattery, were to yield a little, he would soon be obliged to grant all to their demands and their threats; and finally, Beckendorff has, of late years, so completely interwoven the policy of Reisenburg with that of Austria, that he feels that the rock on which he has determined to found the greatness of his country must be quitted for ever if he yield one jot to the caprice or the weakness of his monarch."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="VivianG.c63.p1"><s sid="1" id="VivianG.c63.s1">It was on the third day of the visit to Mr. Beckendorff, just as that gentleman was composing his mind after his noon meal with his favourite Cremona, and in a moment of rapture raising his instrument high in the air, that the door was suddenly dashed open, and Essper George rushed into the room.</s> <s sid="2" id="VivianG.c63.s2">The intruder, the moment that his eye caught Vivian, flew to his master, and, seizing him by the arm, commenced and continued a loud shout of exultation, accompanying his scream the whole time by a kind of quick dance, which, though not quite as clamorous as the Pyrrhic, nevertheless completely drowned the scientific harmony of Mr. Beckendorff.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="VivianG.c63.p2"><s sid="3" id="VivianG.c63.s3">So astounded were the three gentlemen by this unexpected entrance, that some moments elapsed ere either of them found words at his command.</s> <s sid="4" id="VivianG.c63.s4">At length the master of the house spoke.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="VivianG.c63.p4"><s sid="6" id="VivianG.c63.s6">The Prince did not answer, but looked at Vivian in great distress; and just as our hero was about to give Mr. Beckendorff the requisite information, Essper George, taking up the parable himself, seized the opportunity of explaining the mystery.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="VivianG.c63.p6"><s sid="26" id="VivianG.c63.s26">The embarrassment of the Prince and Vivian while Essper George addressed to Mr. Beckendorff these choice queries was indescribable.</s> <s sid="27" id="VivianG.c63.s27">Once Vivian tried to check him, but in vain.</s> <s sid="28" id="VivianG.c63.s28">He did not repeat his attempt, for he was sufficiently employed in restraining his own agitation and keeping his own countenance; for in spite of the mortification and anger that Essper's appearance had excited in him, still an unfortunate but innate taste for the ludicrous did not allow him to be perfectly insensible to the humour of the scene.</s> <s sid="29" id="VivianG.c63.s29">Mr. Beckendorff listened quietly till Essper had finished; he then rose.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER I</title>

<p pid="1" id="VivianG.c64.p1"><s sid="1" id="VivianG.c64.s1">As Vivian left the room Mr. Beckendorff was seized with an unusual desire to converse with the Prince of Little Lilliput, and his Highness was consequently debarred the consolation of walking with his friend as far as the horses.</s> <s sid="2" id="VivianG.c64.s2">At the little gate Vivian and Essper encountered the only male attendant who was allowed to approach the house of Mr. Beckendorff.</s> <s sid="3" id="VivianG.c64.s3">As Vivian quietly walked his horse up the rough turf road, he could not refrain from recurring to his conversation of the previous night; and when he called to mind the adventures of the last six days, he had new cause to wonder at, and perhaps to lament over, his singular fate.</s> <s sid="4" id="VivianG.c64.s4">In that short time he had saved the life of a powerful Prince, and being immediately signalled out, without any exertion on his part, as the object of that Prince's friendship, the moment he arrives at his castle, by a wonderful contingency, he becomes the depositary of state secrets, and assists in a consultation of importance with one of the most powerful Ministers in Europe.</s> <s sid="5" id="VivianG.c64.s5">And now the object of so much friendship, confidence, and honour, he is suddenly on the road to the capital of the State of which his late host is the Prime Minister and his friend the chief subject, without even the convenience of a common letter of introduction; and with little prospect of viewing, with even the usual advantages of a common traveller, one of the most interesting of European Courts.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="VivianG.c64.p2"><s sid="6" id="VivianG.c64.s6">When he had proceeded about halfway up the turf lane he found a private road to his right, which, with that spirit of adventure for which Englishmen are celebrated, he immediately resolved must not only lead to Reisenburg, but also carry him to that city much sooner than the regular high road.</s> <s sid="7" id="VivianG.c64.s7">He had not advanced far up this road before he came to the gate at which he had parted with Beckendorff on the morning that gentleman had roused him so unexpectedly from, his reverie in a green lane.</s> <s sid="8" id="VivianG.c64.s8">He was surprised to find a horseman dismounting at the gate.</s> <s sid="9" id="VivianG.c64.s9">Struck by this singular circumstance, the appearance of the stranger was not unnoticed.</s> <s sid="10" id="VivianG.c64.s10">He was a tall and well proportioned man, and as the traveller passed he stared Vivian so fully in the face that our hero did not fail to remark his handsome countenance, the expression of which, however, was rather vacant and unpleasing.</s> <s sid="11" id="VivianG.c64.s11">He was dressed in a riding-coat exactly similar to the one always worn by Beckendorff's messenger, and had Vivian not seen him so distinctly he would have mistaken him for that person.</s> <s sid="12" id="VivianG.c64.s12">The stranger was rather indifferently mounted, and carried his cloak and a small portmanteau at the back of his saddle.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="VivianG.c64.p3" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="VivianG.c64.s13"><qs/>"I suppose it is the butler,"<qe/> said Essper George, who now spoke for the first time since his dismissal from the room.</s> <s sid="14" id="VivianG.c64.s14">Vivian did not answer him; not because he entertained any angry feeling on account of his exceedingly unpleasant visit.</s> <s sid="15" id="VivianG.c64.s15">By no means: it was impossible for a man like Vivian Grey to cherish an irritated feeling for a second.</s> <s sid="16" id="VivianG.c64.s16">But he did not exchange a syllable with Essper George, merely because he was not in the humour to speak.</s> <s sid="17" id="VivianG.c64.s17">He could not refrain from musing on the singular events of the last few days; and, above all, the character of Beckendorff particularly engrossed his meditation.</s> <s sid="18" id="VivianG.c64.s18">Their conversation of the preceding night excited in his mind new feelings of wonder, and revived emotions which he thought were dead or everlastingly dormant.</s> <s sid="19" id="VivianG.c64.s19">Apparently, the philosophy on which Beckendorff had regulated his career, and by which he had arrived at his pitch of greatness, was exactly the same with which he himself, Vivian Grey, had started in life; which he had found so fatal in its consequences; which he believed to be so vain in its principles.</s> <s sid="20" id="VivianG.c64.s20">How was this?</s> <s sid="21" id="VivianG.c64.s21">What radical error had he committed?</s> <s sid="22" id="VivianG.c64.s22">It required little consideration.</s> <s sid="23" id="VivianG.c64.s23">Thirty, and more than thirty, years had passed over the head of Beckendorff ere the world felt his power, or indeed was conscious of his existence.</s> <s sid="24" id="VivianG.c64.s24">A deep student, not only of man in detail, but of man in groups; not only of individuals, but of nations; Beckendorff had hived up his ample knowledge of all subjects which could interest his fellow-creatures, and when that opportunity which in this world occurs to all men occurred to Beckendorff he was prepared.</s> <s sid="25" id="VivianG.c64.s25">With acquirements equal to his genius, Beckendorff depended only upon himself, and succeeded.</s> <s sid="26" id="VivianG.c64.s26">Vivian Grey, with a mind inferior to no man's, dashed on the stage, in years a boy, though in feelings a man.</s> <s sid="27" id="VivianG.c64.s27">Brilliant as might have been his genius, his acquirements necessarily were insufficient.</s> <s sid="28" id="VivianG.c64.s28">He could not depend only upon himself; a consequent necessity arose to have recourse to the assistance of others; to inspire them with feelings which they could not share; and humour and manage the petty weaknesses which he himself could not experience.</s> <s sid="29" id="VivianG.c64.s29">His colleagues were, at the same time, to work for the gratification of their own private interests, the most palpable of all abstract things; and to carry into execution a great purpose, which their feeble minds, interested only by the first point, cared not to comprehend.</s> <s sid="30" id="VivianG.c64.s30">The unnatural combination failed, and its originator fell.</s> <s sid="31" id="VivianG.c64.s31">To believe that he could recur again to the hopes, the feelings, the pursuits of his boyhood, he felt to be the vainest of delusions.</s> <s sid="32" id="VivianG.c64.s32">It was the expectation of a man like Beckendorff, whose career, though difficult, though hazardous, had been uniformly successful; of a man who mistook cares for grief, and anxiety for sorrow.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="VivianG.c64.p4"><s sid="33" id="VivianG.c64.s33">The travellers entered the city at sunset.</s> <s sid="34" id="VivianG.c64.s34">Proceeding through an ancient and unseemly town, full of long, narrow, and ill-paved streets, and black unevenly built houses, they ascended the hill, on the top of which was situated the new and Residence town of Reisenburg.</s> <s sid="35" id="VivianG.c64.s35">The proud palace, the white squares, the architectural streets, the new churches, the elegant opera house, the splendid hotels, and the gay public gardens, full of busts, vases, and statues, and surrounded by an iron railing cast out of the cannon taken from both sides during the war by the Reisenburg troops, and now formed into pikes and fasces, glittering with gilded heads: all these, shining in the setting sun, produced an effect which, at any time and in any place, would have been beautiful and striking; but on the present occasion were still more so, from the remarkable contrast they afforded to the ancient, gloomy, and filthy town through which Vivian had just passed, and where, from the lowness of its situation, the sun had already set.</s> <s sid="36" id="VivianG.c64.s36">There was as much difference between the old and new town of Reisenburg as between the old barbarous Margrave and the new and noble Grand Duke.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="VivianG.c64.p5"><s sid="37" id="VivianG.c64.s37">On the second day after his arrival at Reisenburg, Vivian received the following letter from the Prince of Little Lilliput.</s> <s sid="38" id="VivianG.c64.s38">His luggage did not accompany the epistle.</s> </p>
