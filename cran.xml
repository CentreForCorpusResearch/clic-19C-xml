<title>CHAPTER I--OUR SOCIETY</title>

<p pid="1" id="cran.c1.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="cran.c1.s1">In the first place, Cranford is in possession of the Amazons; all the holders of houses above a certain rent are women.</s> <s sid="2" id="cran.c1.s2">If a married couple come to settle in the town, somehow the gentleman disappears; he is either fairly frightened to death by being the only man in the Cranford evening parties, or he is accounted for by being with his regiment, his ship, or closely engaged in business all the week in the great neighbouring commercial town of Drumble, distant only twenty miles on a railroad.</s> <s sid="3" id="cran.c1.s3">In short, whatever does become of the gentlemen, they are not at Cranford.</s> <s sid="4" id="cran.c1.s4">What could they do if they were there?</s> <s sid="5" id="cran.c1.s5">The surgeon has his round of thirty miles, and sleeps at Cranford; but every man cannot be a surgeon.</s> <s sid="6" id="cran.c1.s6">For keeping the trim gardens full of choice flowers without a weed to speck them; for frightening away little boys who look wistfully at the said flowers through the railings; for rushing out at the geese that occasionally venture in to the gardens if the gates are left open; for deciding all questions of literature and politics without troubling themselves with unnecessary reasons or arguments; for obtaining clear and correct knowledge of everybody's affairs in the parish; for keeping their neat maid-servants in admirable order; for kindness (somewhat dictatorial) to the poor, and real tender good offices to each other whenever they are in distress, the ladies of Cranford are quite sufficient.</s> <s sid="7" id="cran.c1.s7"><qs/>"A man,"<qe/><sls/> as one of them observed to me once, <sle/><qs/>"is SO in the way in the house!"<qe/></s> <s sid="8" id="cran.c1.s8">Although the ladies of Cranford know all each other's proceedings, they are exceedingly indifferent to each other's opinions.</s> <s sid="9" id="cran.c1.s9">Indeed, as each has her own individuality, not to say eccentricity, pretty strongly developed, nothing is so easy as verbal retaliation; but, somehow, good-will reigns among them to a considerable degree.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="cran.c1.p2" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="cran.c1.s10">The Cranford ladies have only an occasional little quarrel, spirited out in a few peppery words and angry jerks of the head; just enough to prevent the even tenor of their lives from becoming too flat.</s> <s sid="11" id="cran.c1.s11">Their dress is very independent of fashion; as they observe, <qs/>"What does it signify how we dress here at Cranford, where everybody knows us?"<qe/></s> <s sid="12" id="cran.c1.s12">And if they go from home, their reason is equally cogent, <qs/>"What does it signify how we dress here, where nobody knows us?"<qe/></s> <s sid="13" id="cran.c1.s13">The materials of their clothes are, in general, good and plain, and most of them are nearly as scrupulous as Miss Tyler, of cleanly memory; but I will answer for it, the last gigot, the last tight and scanty petticoat in wear in England, was seen in Cranford--and seen without a smile.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="cran.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="cran.c1.s14">I can testify to a magnificent family red silk umbrella, under which a gentle little spinster, left alone of many brothers and sisters, used to patter to church on rainy days.</s> <s sid="15" id="cran.c1.s15">Have you any red silk umbrellas in London?</s> <s sid="16" id="cran.c1.s16">We had a tradition of the first that had ever been seen in Cranford; and the little boys mobbed it, and called it <qs/>"a stick in petticoats."<qe/></s> <s sid="17" id="cran.c1.s17">It might have been the very red silk one I have described, held by a strong father over a troop of little ones; the poor little lady--the survivor of all--could scarcely carry it.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="cran.c1.p4"><s sid="18" id="cran.c1.s18">Then there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls; and they were announced to any young people who might be staying in the town, with all the solemnity with which the old Manx laws were read once a year on the Tinwald Mount.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="cran.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="cran.c1.s19">"Our friends have sent to inquire how you are after your journey to-night, my dear" (fifteen miles in a gentleman's carriage); <qs/>"they will give you some rest to-morrow, but the next day, I have no doubt, they will call; so be at liberty after twelve--from twelve to three are our calling hours."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="cran.c1.p6"><s sid="20" id="cran.c1.s20">Then, after they had called -</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="cran.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="cran.c1.s21"><qs/>"It is the third day; I dare say your mamma has told you, my dear, never to let more than three days elapse between receiving a call and returning it; and also, that you are never to stay longer than a quarter of an hour."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="cran.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="cran.c1.s22"><qs/>"But am I to look at my watch?</s> <s sid="23" id="cran.c1.s23">How am I to find out when a quarter of an hour has passed?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="cran.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="cran.c1.s24"><qs/>"You must keep thinking about the time, my dear, and not allow yourself to forget it in conversation."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="cran.c1.p10"><s sid="25" id="cran.c1.s25">As everybody had this rule in their minds, whether they received or paid a call, of course no absorbing subject was ever spoken about.</s> <s sid="26" id="cran.c1.s26">We kept ourselves to short sentences of small talk, and were punctual to our time.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="cran.c1.p11"><s sid="27" id="cran.c1.s27">I imagine that a few of the gentlefolks of Cranford were poor, and had some difficulty in making both ends meet; but they were like the Spartans, and concealed their smart under a smiling face.</s> <s sid="28" id="cran.c1.s28">We none of us spoke of money, because that subject savoured of commerce and trade, and though some might be poor, we were all aristocratic.</s> <s sid="29" id="cran.c1.s29">The Cranfordians had that kindly esprit de corps which made them overlook all deficiencies in success when some among them tried to conceal their poverty.</s> <s sid="30" id="cran.c1.s30">When Mrs Forrester, for instance, gave a party in her baby-house of a dwelling, and the little maiden disturbed the ladies on the sofa by a request that she might get the tea-tray out from underneath, everyone took this novel proceeding as the most natural thing in the world, and talked on about household forms and ceremonies as if we all believed that our hostess had a regular servants' hall, second table, with housekeeper and steward, instead of the one little charity-school maiden, whose short ruddy arms could never have been strong enough to carry the tray upstairs, if she had not been assisted in private by her mistress, who now sat in state, pretending not to know what cakes were sent up, though she knew, and we knew, and she knew that we knew, and we knew that she knew that we knew, she had been busy all the morning making tea-bread and sponge-cakes.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="cran.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="cran.c1.s31">There were one or two consequences arising from this general but unacknowledged poverty, and this very much acknowledged gentility, which were not amiss, and which might be introduced into many circles of society to their great improvement.</s> <s sid="32" id="cran.c1.s32">For instance, the inhabitants of Cranford kept early hours, and clattered home in their pattens, under the guidance of a lantern-bearer, about nine o'clock at night; and the whole town was abed and asleep by half- past ten.</s> <s sid="33" id="cran.c1.s33">Moreover, it was considered "vulgar" (a tremendous word in Cranford) to give anything expensive, in the way of eatable or drinkable, at the evening entertainments.</s> <s sid="34" id="cran.c1.s34">Wafer bread-and-butter and sponge-biscuits were all that the Honourable Mrs Jamieson gave; and she was sister-in-law to the late Earl of Glenmire, although she did practise such <qs/>"elegant economy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="cran.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="cran.c1.s35"><qs/>"Elegant economy!"<qe/></s> <s sid="36" id="cran.c1.s36">How naturally one falls back into the phraseology of Cranford!</s> <s sid="37" id="cran.c1.s37">There, economy was always <qs/>"elegant,"<qe/> and money-spending always "vulgar and ostentatious"; a sort of sour- grapeism which made us very peaceful and satisfied.</s> <s sid="38" id="cran.c1.s38">I never shall forget the dismay felt when a certain Captain Brown came to live at Cranford, and openly spoke about his being poor--not in a whisper to an intimate friend, the doors and windows being previously closed, but in the public street! in a loud military voice! alleging his poverty as a reason for not taking a particular house.</s> <s sid="39" id="cran.c1.s39">The ladies of Cranford were already rather moaning over the invasion of their territories by a man and a gentleman.</s> <s sid="40" id="cran.c1.s40">He was a half-pay captain, and had obtained some situation on a neighbouring railroad, which had been vehemently petitioned against by the little town; and if, in addition to his masculine gender, and his connection with the obnoxious railroad, he was so brazen as to talk of being poor--why, then, indeed, he must be sent to Coventry.</s> <s sid="41" id="cran.c1.s41">Death was as true and as common as poverty; yet people never spoke about that, loud out in the streets.</s> <s sid="42" id="cran.c1.s42">It was a word not to be mentioned to ears polite.</s> <s sid="43" id="cran.c1.s43">We had tacitly agreed to ignore that any with whom we associated on terms of visiting equality could ever be prevented by poverty from doing anything that they wished.</s> <s sid="44" id="cran.c1.s44">If we walked to or from a party, it was because the night was SO fine, or the air SO refreshing, not because sedan-chairs were expensive.</s> <s sid="45" id="cran.c1.s45">If we wore prints, instead of summer silks, it was because we preferred a washing material; and so on, till we blinded ourselves to the vulgar fact that we were, all of us, people of very moderate means.</s> <s sid="46" id="cran.c1.s46">Of course, then, we did not know what to make of a man who could speak of poverty as if it was not a disgrace.</s> <s sid="47" id="cran.c1.s47">Yet, somehow, Captain Brown made himself respected in Cranford, and was called upon, in spite of all resolutions to the contrary.</s> <s sid="48" id="cran.c1.s48">I was surprised to hear his opinions quoted as authority at a visit which I paid to Cranford about a year after he had settled in the town.</s> <s sid="49" id="cran.c1.s49">My own friends had been among the bitterest opponents of any proposal to visit the Captain and his daughters, only twelve months before; and now he was even admitted in the tabooed hours before twelve.</s> <s sid="50" id="cran.c1.s50">True, it was to discover the cause of a smoking chimney, before the fire was lighted; but still Captain Brown walked upstairs, nothing daunted, spoke in a voice too large for the room, and joked quite in the way of a tame man about the house.</s> <s sid="51" id="cran.c1.s51">He had been blind to all the small slights, and omissions of trivial ceremonies, with which he had been received.</s> <s sid="52" id="cran.c1.s52">He had been friendly, though the Cranford ladies had been cool; he had answered small sarcastic compliments in good faith; and with his manly frankness had overpowered all the shrinking which met him as a man who was not ashamed to be poor.</s> <s sid="53" id="cran.c1.s53">And, at last, his excellent masculine common sense, and his facility in devising expedients to overcome domestic dilemmas, had gained him an extraordinary place as authority among the Cranford ladies.</s> <s sid="54" id="cran.c1.s54">He himself went on in his course, as unaware of his popularity as he had been of the reverse; and I am sure he was startled one day when he found his advice so highly esteemed as to make some counsel which he had given in jest to be taken in sober, serious earnest.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="cran.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="cran.c1.s55">It was on this subject:</s> <s sid="56" id="cran.c1.s56">An old lady had an Alderney cow, which she looked upon as a daughter.</s> <s sid="57" id="cran.c1.s57">You could not pay the short quarter of an hour call without being told of the wonderful milk or wonderful intelligence of this animal.</s> <s sid="58" id="cran.c1.s58">The whole town knew and kindly regarded Miss Betsy Barker's Alderney; therefore great was the sympathy and regret when, in an unguarded moment, the poor cow tumbled into a lime-pit.</s> <s sid="59" id="cran.c1.s59">She moaned so loudly that she was soon heard and rescued; but meanwhile the poor beast had lost most of her hair, and came out looking naked, cold, and miserable, in a bare skin.</s> <s sid="60" id="cran.c1.s60">Everybody pitied the animal, though a few could not restrain their smiles at her droll appearance.</s> <s sid="61" id="cran.c1.s61">Miss Betsy Barker absolutely cried with sorrow and dismay; and it was said she thought of trying a bath of oil.</s> <s sid="62" id="cran.c1.s62">This remedy, perhaps, was recommended by some one of the number whose advice she asked; but the proposal, if ever it was made, was knocked on the head by Captain Brown's decided <qs/>"Get her a flannel waistcoat and flannel drawers, ma'am, if you wish to keep her alive.</s> <s sid="63" id="cran.c1.s63">But my advice is, kill the poor creature at once."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="cran.c1.p15"><s sid="64" id="cran.c1.s64">Miss Betsy Barker dried her eyes, and thanked the Captain heartily; she set to work, and by-and-by all the town turned out to see the Alderney meekly going to her pasture, clad in dark grey flannel.</s> <s sid="65" id="cran.c1.s65">I have watched her myself many a time.</s> <s sid="66" id="cran.c1.s66">Do you ever see cows dressed in grey flannel in London?</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="cran.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="cran.c1.s67">Captain Brown had taken a small house on the outskirts of the town, where he lived with his two daughters.</s> <s sid="68" id="cran.c1.s68">He must have been upwards of sixty at the time of the first visit I paid to Cranford after I had left it as a residence.</s> <s sid="69" id="cran.c1.s69">But he had a wiry, well-trained, elastic figure, a stiff military throw-back of his head, and a springing step, which made him appear much younger than he was.</s> <s sid="70" id="cran.c1.s70">His eldest daughter looked almost as old as himself, and betrayed the fact that his real was more than his apparent age.</s> <s sid="71" id="cran.c1.s71">Miss Brown must have been forty; she had a sickly, pained, careworn expression on her face, and looked as if the gaiety of youth had long faded out of sight.</s> <s sid="72" id="cran.c1.s72">Even when young she must have been plain and hard- featured.</s> <s sid="73" id="cran.c1.s73">Miss Jessie Brown was ten years younger than her sister, and twenty shades prettier.</s> <s sid="74" id="cran.c1.s74">Her face was round and dimpled.</s> <s sid="75" id="cran.c1.s75">Miss Jenkyns once said, in a passion against Captain Brown (the cause of which I will tell you presently), <qs/>"that she thought it was time for Miss Jessie to leave off her dimples, and not always to be trying to look like a child."<qe/></s> <s sid="76" id="cran.c1.s76">It was true there was something childlike in her face; and there will be, I think, till she dies, though she should live to a hundred.</s> <s sid="77" id="cran.c1.s77">Her eyes were large blue wondering eyes, looking straight at you; her nose was unformed and snub, and her lips were red and dewy; she wore her hair, too, in little rows of curls, which heightened this appearance.</s> <s sid="78" id="cran.c1.s78">I do not know whether she was pretty or not; but I liked her face, and so did everybody, and I do not think she could help her dimples.</s> <s sid="79" id="cran.c1.s79">She had something of her father's jauntiness of gait and manner; and any female observer might detect a slight difference in the attire of the two sisters-- that of Miss Jessie being about two pounds per annum more expensive than Miss Brown's.</s> <s sid="80" id="cran.c1.s80">Two pounds was a large sum in Captain Brown's annual disbursements.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="cran.c1.p17"><s sid="81" id="cran.c1.s81">Such was the impression made upon me by the Brown family when I first saw them all together in Cranford Church.</s> <s sid="82" id="cran.c1.s82">The Captain I had met before--on the occasion of the smoky chimney, which he had cured by some simple alteration in the flue.</s> <s sid="83" id="cran.c1.s83">In church, he held his double eye-glass to his eyes during the Morning Hymn, and then lifted up his head erect and sang out loud and joyfully.</s> <s sid="84" id="cran.c1.s84">He made the responses louder than the clerk--an old man with a piping feeble voice, who, I think, felt aggrieved at the Captain's sonorous bass, and quivered higher and higher in consequence.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="cran.c1.p18"><s sid="85" id="cran.c1.s85">On coming out of church, the brisk Captain paid the most gallant attention to his two daughters.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="cran.c1.p19"><s sid="86" id="cran.c1.s86">He nodded and smiled to his acquaintances; but he shook hands with none until he had helped Miss Brown to unfurl her umbrella, had relieved her of her prayer-book, and had waited patiently till she, with trembling nervous hands, had taken up her gown to walk through the wet roads.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="cran.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="cran.c1.s87">I wonder what the Cranford ladies did with Captain Brown at their parties.</s> <s sid="88" id="cran.c1.s88">We had often rejoiced, in former days, that there was no gentleman to be attended to, and to find conversation for, at the card-parties.</s> <s sid="89" id="cran.c1.s89">We had congratulated ourselves upon the snugness of the evenings; and, in our love for gentility, and distaste of mankind, we had almost persuaded ourselves that to be a man was to be "vulgar"; so that when I found my friend and hostess, Miss Jenkyns, was going to have a party in my honour, and that Captain and the Miss Browns were invited, I wondered much what would be the course of the evening.</s> <s sid="90" id="cran.c1.s90">Card-tables, with green baize tops, were set out by daylight, just as usual; it was the third week in November, so the evenings closed in about four.</s> <s sid="91" id="cran.c1.s91">Candles, and clean packs of cards, were arranged on each table.</s> <s sid="92" id="cran.c1.s92">The fire was made up; the neat maid-servant had received her last directions; and there we stood, dressed in our best, each with a candle-lighter in our hands, ready to dart at the candles as soon as the first knock came.</s> <s sid="93" id="cran.c1.s93">Parties in Cranford were solemn festivities, making the ladies feel gravely elated as they sat together in their best dresses.</s> <s sid="94" id="cran.c1.s94">As soon as three had arrived, we sat down to <qs/>"Preference,"<qe/> I being the unlucky fourth.</s> <s sid="95" id="cran.c1.s95">The next four comers were put down immediately to another table; and presently the tea- trays, which I had seen set out in the store-room as I passed in the morning, were placed each on the middle of a card-table.</s> <s sid="96" id="cran.c1.s96">The china was delicate egg-shell; the old-fashioned silver glittered with polishing; but the eatables were of the slightest description.</s> <s sid="97" id="cran.c1.s97">While the trays were yet on the tables, Captain and the Miss Browns came in; and I could see that, somehow or other, the Captain was a favourite with all the ladies present.</s> <s sid="98" id="cran.c1.s98">Ruffled brows were smoothed, sharp voices lowered at his approach.</s> <s sid="99" id="cran.c1.s99">Miss Brown looked ill, and depressed almost to gloom.</s> <s sid="100" id="cran.c1.s100">Miss Jessie smiled as usual, and seemed nearly as popular as her father.</s> <s sid="101" id="cran.c1.s101">He immediately and quietly assumed the man's place in the room; attended to every one's wants, lessened the pretty maid-servant's labour by waiting on empty cups and bread-and-butterless ladies; and yet did it all in so easy and dignified a manner, and so much as if it were a matter of course for the strong to attend to the weak, that he was a true man throughout.</s> <s sid="102" id="cran.c1.s102">He played for threepenny points with as grave an interest as if they had been pounds; and yet, in all his attention to strangers, he had an eye on his suffering daughter-- for suffering I was sure she was, though to many eyes she might only appear to be irritable.</s> <s sid="103" id="cran.c1.s103">Miss Jessie could not play cards: but she talked to the sitters-out, who, before her coming, had been rather inclined to be cross.</s> <s sid="104" id="cran.c1.s104">She sang, too, to an old cracked piano, which I think had been a spinet in its youth.</s> <s sid="105" id="cran.c1.s105">Miss Jessie sang, "Jock of Hazeldean" a little out of tune; but we were none of us musical, though Miss Jenkyns beat time, out of time, by way of appearing to be so.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="cran.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="cran.c1.s106">It was very good of Miss Jenkyns to do this; for I had seen that, a little before, she had been a good deal annoyed by Miss Jessie Brown's unguarded admission (a propos of Shetland wool) that she had an uncle, her mother's brother, who was a shop-keeper in Edinburgh.</s> <s sid="107" id="cran.c1.s107">Miss Jenkyns tried to drown this confession by a terrible cough--for the Honourable Mrs Jamieson was sitting at a card-table nearest Miss Jessie, and what would she say or think if she found out she was in the same room with a shop-keeper's niece!</s> <s sid="108" id="cran.c1.s108">But Miss Jessie Brown (who had no tact, as we all agreed the next morning) WOULD repeat the information, and assure Miss Pole she could easily get her the identical Shetland wool required, <qs/>"through my uncle, who has the best assortment of Shetland goods of any one in Edinbro'."<qe/></s> <s sid="109" id="cran.c1.s109">It was to take the taste of this out of our mouths, and the sound of this out of our ears, that Miss Jenkyns proposed music; so I say again, it was very good of her to beat time to the song.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="cran.c1.p22"><s sid="110" id="cran.c1.s110">When the trays re-appeared with biscuits and wine, punctually at a quarter to nine, there was conversation, comparing of cards, and talking over tricks; but by-and-by Captain Brown sported a bit of literature.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="cran.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="111" id="cran.c1.s111"><qs/>"Have you seen any numbers of 'The Pickwick Papers'?"<qe/> said he.</s> <s sid="112" id="cran.c1.s112">(They we're then publishing in parts.)</s> <s sid="113" id="cran.c1.s113"><qs/>"Capital thing!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="cran.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="114" id="cran.c1.s114">Now Miss Jenkyns was daughter of a deceased rector of Cranford; and, on the strength of a number of manuscript sermons, and a pretty good library of divinity, considered herself literary, and looked upon any conversation about books as a challenge to her.</s> <s sid="115" id="cran.c1.s115">So she answered and said, <qs/>"Yes, she had seen them; indeed, she might say she had read them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="cran.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="116" id="cran.c1.s116"><qs/>"And what do you think of them?"<qe/> exclaimed Captain Brown.</s> <s sid="117" id="cran.c1.s117"><qs/>"Aren't they famously good?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="cran.c1.p26"><s sid="118" id="cran.c1.s118">So urged Miss Jenkyns could not but speak.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="cran.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="119" id="cran.c1.s119"><qs/>"I must say, I don't think they are by any means equal to Dr Johnson.</s> <s sid="120" id="cran.c1.s120">Still, perhaps, the author is young.</s> <s sid="121" id="cran.c1.s121">Let him persevere, and who knows what he may become if he will take the great Doctor for his model?"<qe/></s> <s sid="122" id="cran.c1.s122">This was evidently too much for Captain Brown to take placidly; and I saw the words on the tip of his tongue before Miss Jenkyns had finished her sentence.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="cran.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="123" id="cran.c1.s123"><qs/>"It is quite a different sort of thing, my dear madam,"<qe/> he began.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="cran.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="124" id="cran.c1.s124"><qs/>"I am quite aware of that,"<qe/> returned she.</s> <s sid="125" id="cran.c1.s125"><qs/>"And I make allowances, Captain Brown."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="cran.c1.p30" type="speech"><s sid="126" id="cran.c1.s126"><qs/>"Just allow me to read you a scene out of this month's number,"<qe/> pleaded he.</s> <s sid="127" id="cran.c1.s127"><qs/>"I had it only this morning, and I don't think the company can have read it yet."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="cran.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="128" id="cran.c1.s128"><qs/>"As you please,"<qe/> said she, settling herself with an air of resignation.</s> <s sid="129" id="cran.c1.s129">He read the account of the "swarry" which Sam Weller gave at Bath.</s> <s sid="130" id="cran.c1.s130">Some of us laughed heartily.</s> <s sid="131" id="cran.c1.s131">_I_ did not dare, because I was staying in the house.</s> <s sid="132" id="cran.c1.s132">Miss Jenkyns sat in patient gravity.</s> <s sid="133" id="cran.c1.s133">When it was ended, she turned to me, and said with mild dignity -</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="cran.c1.p32" type="speech"><s sid="134" id="cran.c1.s134"><qs/>"Fetch me <alt-qs/>'Rasselas,'<alt-qe/> my dear, out of the book-room."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="cran.c3.p9" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="cran.c3.s28">This subject of servants was a standing grievance, and I could not wonder much at it; for if gentlemen were scarce, and almost unheard of in the "genteel society" of Cranford, they or their counterparts--handsome young men--abounded in the lower classes.</s> <s sid="29" id="cran.c3.s29">The pretty neat servant-maids had their choice of desirable "followers"; and their mistresses, without having the sort of mysterious dread of men and matrimony that Miss Matilda had, might well feel a little anxious lest the heads of their comely maids should be turned by the joiner, or the butcher, or the gardener, who were obliged, by their callings, to come to the house, and who, as ill-luck would have it, were generally handsome and unmarried.</s> <s sid="30" id="cran.c3.s30">Fanny's lovers, if she had any--and Miss Matilda suspected her of so many flirtations that, if she had not been very pretty, I should have doubted her having one--were a constant anxiety to her mistress.</s> <s sid="31" id="cran.c3.s31">She was forbidden, by the articles of her engagement, to have "followers"; and though she had answered, innocently enough, doubling up the hem of her apron as she spoke, <qs/>"Please, ma'am, I never had more than one at a time,"<qe/> Miss Matty prohibited that one.</s> <s sid="32" id="cran.c3.s32">But a vision of a man seemed to haunt the kitchen.</s> <s sid="33" id="cran.c3.s33">Fanny assured me that it was all fancy, or else I should have said myself that I had seen a man's coat-tails whisk into the scullery once, when I went on an errand into the store-room at night; and another evening, when, our watches having stopped, I went to look at the clock, there was a very odd appearance, singularly like a young man squeezed up between the clock and the back of the open kitchen- door:  and I thought Fanny snatched up the candle very hastily, so as to throw the shadow on the clock face, while she very positively told me the time half-an-hour too early, as we found out afterwards by the church clock.</s> <s sid="34" id="cran.c3.s34">But I did not add to Miss Matty's anxieties by naming my suspicions, especially as Fanny said to me, the next day, that it was such a queer kitchen for having odd shadows about it, she really was almost afraid to stay; <qs/>"for you know, miss,"<qe/><sss/> she added, <sse/><qs/>"I don't see a creature from six o'clock tea, till Missus rings the bell for prayers at ten."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="cran.c5.p5"><s sid="34" id="cran.c5.s34">Miss Matty undid the packet with a sigh; but she stifled it directly, as if it were hardly right to regret the flight of time, or of life either.</s> <s sid="35" id="cran.c5.s35">We agreed to look them over separately, each taking a different letter out of the same bundle and describing its contents to the other before destroying it.</s> <s sid="36" id="cran.c5.s36">I never knew what sad work the reading of old-letters was before that evening, though I could hardly tell why.</s> <s sid="37" id="cran.c5.s37">The letters were as happy as letters could be--at least those early letters were.</s> <s sid="38" id="cran.c5.s38">There was in them a vivid and intense sense of the present time, which seemed so strong and full, as if it could never pass away, and as if the warm, living hearts that so expressed themselves could never die, and be as nothing to the sunny earth.</s> <s sid="39" id="cran.c5.s39">I should have felt less melancholy, I believe, if the letters had been more so.</s> <s sid="40" id="cran.c5.s40">I saw the tears stealing down the well-worn furrows of Miss Matty's cheeks, and her spectacles often wanted wiping.</s> <s sid="41" id="cran.c5.s41">I trusted at last that she would light the other candle, for my own eyes were rather dim, and I wanted more light to see the pale, faded ink; but no, even through her tears, she saw and remembered her little economical ways.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="cran.c5.p6" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="cran.c5.s42">The earliest set of letters were two bundles tied together, and ticketed (in Miss Jenkyns's handwriting) <qs/>"Letters interchanged between my ever-honoured father and my dearly-beloved mother, prior to their marriage, in July 1774."<qe/></s> <s sid="43" id="cran.c5.s43">I should guess that the rector of Cranford was about twenty-seven years of age when he wrote those letters; and Miss Matty told me that her mother was just eighteen at the time of her wedding.</s> <s sid="44" id="cran.c5.s44">With my idea of the rector derived from a picture in the dining-parlour, stiff and stately, in a huge full-bottomed wig, with gown, cassock, and bands, and his hand upon a copy of the only sermon he ever published--it was strange to read these letters.</s> <s sid="45" id="cran.c5.s45">They were full of eager, passionate ardour; short homely sentences, right fresh from the heart (very different from the grand Latinised, Johnsonian style of the printed sermon preached before some judge at assize time).</s> <s sid="46" id="cran.c5.s46">His letters were a curious contrast to those of his girl-bride.</s> <s sid="47" id="cran.c5.s47">She was evidently rather annoyed at his demands upon her for expressions of love, and could not quite understand what he meant by repeating the same thing over in so many different ways; but what she was quite clear about was a longing for a white <qs/>"Paduasoy"<qe/><sls/>--whatever that might be; and six or seven letters were principally occupied in asking her lover to use his influence with her parents (who evidently kept her in good order) to obtain this or that article of dress, more especially the white <sle/><qs/>"Paduasoy."<qe/></s> <s sid="48" id="cran.c5.s48">He cared nothing how she was dressed; she was always lovely enough for him, as he took pains to assure her, when she begged him to express in his answers a predilection for particular pieces of finery, in order that she might show what he said to her parents.</s> <s sid="49" id="cran.c5.s49">But at length he seemed to find out that she would not be married till she had a "trousseau" to her mind; and then he sent her a letter, which had evidently accompanied a whole box full of finery, and in which he requested that she might be dressed in everything her heart desired.</s> <s sid="50" id="cran.c5.s50">This was the first letter, ticketed in a frail, delicate hand, <qs/>"From my dearest John."<qe/></s> <s sid="51" id="cran.c5.s51">Shortly afterwards they were married, I suppose, from the intermission in their correspondence.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="cran.c5.p7" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="cran.c5.s52"><qs/>"We must burn them, I think,"<qe/> said Miss Matty, looking doubtfully at me.</s> <s sid="53" id="cran.c5.s53"><qs/>"No one will care for them when I am gone."<qe/></s> <s sid="54" id="cran.c5.s54">And one by one she dropped them into the middle of the fire, watching each blaze up, die out, and rise away, in faint, white, ghostly semblance, up the chimney, before she gave another to the same fate.</s> <s sid="55" id="cran.c5.s55">The room was light enough now; but I, like her, was fascinated into watching the destruction of those letters, into which the honest warmth of a manly heart had been poured forth.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="cran.c5.p8" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="cran.c5.s56">The next letter, likewise docketed by Miss Jenkyns, was endorsed, <qs/>"Letter of pious congratulation and exhortation from my venerable grandfather to my beloved mother, on occasion of my own birth.</s> <s sid="57" id="cran.c5.s57">Also some practical remarks on the desirability of keeping warm the extremities of infants, from my excellent grandmother."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="cran.c5.p9" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="cran.c5.s58">The first part was, indeed, a severe and forcible picture of the responsibilities of mothers, and a warning against the evils that were in the world, and lying in ghastly wait for the little baby of two days old.</s> <s sid="59" id="cran.c5.s59">His wife did not write, said the old gentleman, because he had forbidden it, she being indisposed with a sprained ankle, which (he said) quite incapacitated her from holding a pen.</s> <s sid="60" id="cran.c5.s60">However, at the foot of the page was a small <qs/>"T.O.,"<qe/><sls/> and on turning it over, sure enough, there was a letter to <sle/><qs/>"my dear, dearest Molly,"<qe/> begging her, when she left her room, whatever she did, to go UP stairs before going DOWN:  and telling her to wrap her baby's feet up in flannel, and keep it warm by the fire, although it was summer, for babies were so tender.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="cran.c5.p10" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="cran.c5.s61">It was pretty to see from the letters, which were evidently exchanged with some frequency between the young mother and the grandmother, how the girlish vanity was being weeded out of her heart by love for her baby.</s> <s sid="62" id="cran.c5.s62">The white "Paduasoy" figured again in the letters, with almost as much vigour as before.</s> <s sid="63" id="cran.c5.s63">In one, it was being made into a christening cloak for the baby.</s> <s sid="64" id="cran.c5.s64">It decked it when it went with its parents to spend a day or two at Arley Hall.</s> <s sid="65" id="cran.c5.s65">It added to its charms, when it was <qs/>"the prettiest little baby that ever was seen.</s> <s sid="66" id="cran.c5.s66">Dear mother, I wish you could see her!</s> <s sid="67" id="cran.c5.s67">Without any pershality, I do think she will grow up a regular bewty!"<qe/></s> <s sid="68" id="cran.c5.s68">I thought of Miss Jenkyns, grey, withered, and wrinkled, and I wondered if her mother had known her in the courts of heaven:  and then I knew that she had, and that they stood there in angelic guise.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER VII--VISITING</title>

<p pid="1" id="cran.c7.p1"><s sid="1" id="cran.c7.s1">One morning, as Miss Matty and I sat at our work--it was before twelve o'clock, and Miss Matty had not changed the cap with yellow ribbons that had been Miss Jenkyns's best, and which Miss Matty was now wearing out in private, putting on the one made in imitation of Mrs Jamieson's at all times when she expected to be seen--Martha came up, and asked if Miss Betty Barker might speak to her mistress.</s> <s sid="2" id="cran.c7.s2">Miss Matty assented, and quickly disappeared to change the yellow ribbons, while Miss Barker came upstairs; but, as she had forgotten her spectacles, and was rather flurried by the unusual time of the visit, I was not surprised to see her return with one cap on the top of the other.</s> <s sid="3" id="cran.c7.s3">She was quite unconscious of it herself, and looked at us, with bland satisfaction.</s> <s sid="4" id="cran.c7.s4">Nor do I think Miss Barker perceived it; for, putting aside the little circumstance that she was not so young as she had been, she was very much absorbed in her errand, which she delivered herself of with an oppressive modesty that found vent in endless apologies.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="cran.c7.p2" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="cran.c7.s5">Miss Betty Barker was the daughter of the old clerk at Cranford who had officiated in Mr Jenkyns's time.</s> <s sid="6" id="cran.c7.s6">She and her sister had had pretty good situations as ladies' maids, and had saved money enough to set up a milliner's shop, which had been patronised by the ladies in the neighbourhood.</s> <s sid="7" id="cran.c7.s7">Lady Arley, for instance, would occasionally give Miss Barkers the pattern of an old cap of hers, which they immediately copied and circulated among the elite of Cranford.</s> <s sid="8" id="cran.c7.s8">I say the elite, for Miss Barkers had caught the trick of the place, and piqued themselves upon their <qs/>"aristocratic connection."<qe/></s> <s sid="9" id="cran.c7.s9">They would not sell their caps and ribbons to anyone without a pedigree.</s> <s sid="10" id="cran.c7.s10">Many a farmer's wife or daughter turned away huffed from Miss Barkers' select millinery, and went rather to the universal shop, where the profits of brown soap and moist sugar enabled the proprietor to go straight to (Paris, he said, until he found his customers too patriotic and John Bullish to wear what the Mounseers wore) London, where, as he often told his customers, Queen Adelaide had appeared, only the very week before, in a cap exactly like the one he showed them, trimmed with yellow and blue ribbons, and had been complimented by King William on the becoming nature of her head-dress.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="cran.c7.p3"><s sid="11" id="cran.c7.s11">Miss Barkers, who confined themselves to truth, and did not approve of miscellaneous customers, throve notwithstanding.</s> <s sid="12" id="cran.c7.s12">They were self-denying, good people.</s> <s sid="13" id="cran.c7.s13">Many a time have I seen the eldest of them (she that had been maid to Mrs Jamieson) carrying out some delicate mess to a poor person.</s> <s sid="14" id="cran.c7.s14">They only aped their betters in having "nothing to do" with the class immediately below theirs.</s> <s sid="15" id="cran.c7.s15">And when Miss Barker died, their profits and income were found to be such that Miss Betty was justified in shutting up shop and retiring from business.</s> <s sid="16" id="cran.c7.s16">She also (as I think I have before said) set up her cow; a mark of respectability in Cranford almost as decided as setting up a gig is among some people.</s> <s sid="17" id="cran.c7.s17">She dressed finer than any lady in Cranford; and we did not wonder at it; for it was understood that she was wearing out all the bonnets and caps and outrageous ribbons which had once formed her stock-in-trade.</s> <s sid="18" id="cran.c7.s18">It was five or six years since she had given up shop, so in any other place than Cranford her dress might have been considered passee.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="cran.c7.p4" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="cran.c7.s19">And now Miss Betty Barker had called to invite Miss Matty to tea at her house on the following Tuesday.</s> <s sid="20" id="cran.c7.s20">She gave me also an impromptu invitation, as I happened to be a visitor--though I could see she had a little fear lest, since my father had gone to live in Drumble, he might have engaged in that <qs/>"horrid cotton trade,"<qe/><sls/> and so dragged his family down out of <sle/><qs/>"aristocratic society."<qe/></s> <s sid="21" id="cran.c7.s21">She prefaced this invitation with so many apologies that she quite excited my curiosity.</s> <s sid="22" id="cran.c7.s22">"Her presumption" was to be excused.</s> <s sid="23" id="cran.c7.s23">What had she been doing?</s> <s sid="24" id="cran.c7.s24">She seemed so over-powered by it I could only think that she had been writing to Queen Adelaide to ask for a receipt for washing lace; but the act which she so characterised was only an invitation she had carried to her sister's former mistress, Mrs Jamieson.</s> <s sid="25" id="cran.c7.s25"><qs/>"Her former occupation considered, could Miss Matty excuse the liberty?"<qe/></s> <s sid="26" id="cran.c7.s26">Ah! thought I, she has found out that double cap, and is going to rectify Miss Matty's head-dress.</s> <s sid="27" id="cran.c7.s27">No! it was simply to extend her invitation to Miss Matty and to me.</s> <s sid="28" id="cran.c7.s28">Miss Matty bowed acceptance; and I wondered that, in the graceful action, she did not feel the unusual weight and extraordinary height of her head-dress.</s> <s sid="29" id="cran.c7.s29">But I do not think she did, for she recovered her balance, and went on talking to Miss Betty in a kind, condescending manner, very different from the fidgety way she would have had if she had suspected how singular her appearance was.</s> <s sid="30" id="cran.c7.s30"><qs/>"Mrs Jamieson is coming, I think you said?"<qe/> asked Miss Matty.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="cran.c7.p5" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="cran.c7.s31"><qs/>"Yes.</s> <s sid="32" id="cran.c7.s32">Mrs Jamieson most kindly and condescendingly said she would be happy to come.</s> <s sid="33" id="cran.c7.s33">One little stipulation she made, that she should bring Carlo.</s> <s sid="34" id="cran.c7.s34">I told her that if I had a weakness, it was for dogs."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="cran.c7.p6" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="cran.c7.s35"><qs/>"And Miss Pole?"<qe/> questioned Miss Matty, who was thinking of her pool at Preference, in which Carlo would not be available as a partner.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="cran.c7.p7" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="cran.c7.s36"><qs/>"I am going to ask Miss Pole.</s> <s sid="37" id="cran.c7.s37">Of course, I could not think of asking her until I had asked you, madam--the rector's daughter, madam.</s> <s sid="38" id="cran.c7.s38">Believe me, I do not forget the situation my father held under yours."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="cran.c7.p8" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="cran.c7.s39"><qs/>"And Mrs Forrester, of course?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="cran.c7.p9" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="cran.c7.s40"><qs/>"And Mrs Forrester.</s> <s sid="41" id="cran.c7.s41">I thought, in fact, of going to her before I went to Miss Pole.</s> <s sid="42" id="cran.c7.s42">Although her circumstances are changed, madam, she was born at Tyrrell, and we can never forget her alliance to the Bigges, of Bigelow Hall."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="cran.c7.p10"><s sid="43" id="cran.c7.s43">Miss Matty cared much more for the little circumstance of her being a very good card-player.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="cran.c7.p11" type="speech" form="extended" position="beginning"><s sid="44" id="cran.c7.s44"><qs/>"Mrs Fitz-Adam--I suppose" -</s> </p><p pid="12" id="cran.c7.p12" type="speech" form="extended" position="end"><s sid="45" id="cran.c7.s45">"No, madam.</s> <s sid="46" id="cran.c7.s46">I must draw a line somewhere.</s> <s sid="47" id="cran.c7.s47">Mrs Jamieson would not, I think, like to meet Mrs Fitz-Adam.</s> <s sid="48" id="cran.c7.s48">I have the greatest respect for Mrs Fitz-Adam--but I cannot think her fit society for such ladies as Mrs Jamieson and Miss Matilda Jenkyns."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="cran.c7.p13"><s sid="49" id="cran.c7.s49">Miss Betty Barker bowed low to Miss Matty, and pursed up her mouth.</s> <s sid="50" id="cran.c7.s50">She looked at me with sidelong dignity, as much as to say, although a retired milliner, she was no democrat, and understood the difference of ranks.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="cran.c7.p14" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="cran.c7.s51"><qs/>"May I beg you to come as near half-past six to my little dwelling, as possible, Miss Matilda?</s> <s sid="52" id="cran.c7.s52">Mrs Jamieson dines at five, but has kindly promised not to delay her visit beyond that time--half-past six."<qe/></s> <s sid="53" id="cran.c7.s53">And with a swimming curtsey Miss Betty Barker took her leave.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="cran.c7.p15"><s sid="54" id="cran.c7.s54">My prophetic soul foretold a visit that afternoon from Miss Pole, who usually came to call on Miss Matilda after any event--or indeed in sight of any event--to talk it over with her.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="cran.c7.p16" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="cran.c7.s55"><qs/>"Miss Betty told me it was to be a choice and select few,"<qe/> said Miss Pole, as she and Miss Matty compared notes.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="cran.c7.p17" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="cran.c7.s56"><qs/>"Yes, so she said.</s> <s sid="57" id="cran.c7.s57">Not even Mrs Fitz-Adam."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="cran.c7.p18"><s sid="58" id="cran.c7.s58">Now Mrs Fitz-Adam was the widowed sister of the Cranford surgeon, whom I have named before.</s> <s sid="59" id="cran.c7.s59">Their parents were respectable farmers, content with their station.</s> <s sid="60" id="cran.c7.s60">The name of these good people was Hoggins.</s> <s sid="61" id="cran.c7.s61">Mr Hoggins was the Cranford doctor now; we disliked the name and considered it coarse; but, as Miss Jenkyns said, if he changed it to Piggins it would not be much better.</s> <s sid="62" id="cran.c7.s62">We had hoped to discover a relationship between him and that Marchioness of Exeter whose name was Molly Hoggins; but the man, careless of his own interests, utterly ignored and denied any such relationship, although, as dear Miss Jenkyns had said, he had a sister called Mary, and the same Christian names were very apt to run in families.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="cran.c7.p19" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="cran.c7.s63">Soon after Miss Mary Hoggins married Mr Fitz-Adam, she disappeared from the neighbourhood for many years.</s> <s sid="64" id="cran.c7.s64">She did not move in a sphere in Cranford society sufficiently high to make any of us care to know what Mr Fitz-Adam was.</s> <s sid="65" id="cran.c7.s65">He died and was gathered to his fathers without our ever having thought about him at all.</s> <s sid="66" id="cran.c7.s66">And then Mrs Fitz-Adam reappeared in Cranford (<qs/>"as bold as a lion,"<qe/><sls/> Miss Pole said), a well-to-do widow, dressed in rustling black silk, so soon after her husband's death that poor Miss Jenkyns was justified in the remark she made, that <sle/><qs/>"bombazine would have shown a deeper sense of her loss."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="cran.c7.p20" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="cran.c7.s67">I remember the convocation of ladies who assembled to decide whether or not Mrs Fitz-Adam should be called upon by the old blue- blooded inhabitants of Cranford.</s> <s sid="68" id="cran.c7.s68">She had taken a large rambling house, which had been usually considered to confer a patent of gentility upon its tenant, because, once upon a time, seventy or eighty years before, the spinster daughter of an earl had resided in it.</s> <s sid="69" id="cran.c7.s69">I am not sure if the inhabiting this house was not also believed to convey some unusual power of intellect; for the earl's daughter, Lady Jane, had a sister, Lady Anne, who had married a general officer in the time of the American war, and this general officer had written one or two comedies, which were still acted on the London boards, and which, when we saw them advertised, made us all draw up, and feel that Drury Lane was paying a very pretty compliment to Cranford.</s> <s sid="70" id="cran.c7.s70">Still, it was not at all a settled thing that Mrs Fitz-Adam was to be visited, when dear Miss Jenkyns died; and, with her, something of the clear knowledge of the strict code of gentility went out too.</s> <s sid="71" id="cran.c7.s71">As Miss Pole observed, <qs/>"As most of the ladies of good family in Cranford were elderly spinsters, or widows without children, if we did not relax a little, and become less exclusive, by-and-by we should have no society at all."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="cran.c7.p21"><s sid="72" id="cran.c7.s72">Mrs Forrester continued on the same side.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="cran.c7.p22" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="cran.c7.s73"><qs/>"She had always understood that Fitz meant something aristocratic; there was Fitz-Roy--she thought that some of the King's children had been called Fitz-Roy; and there was Fitz-Clarence, now--they were the children of dear good King William the Fourth.</s> <s sid="74" id="cran.c7.s74">Fitz- Adam!--it was a pretty name, and she thought it very probably meant <alt-qs/>'Child of Adam.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="75" id="cran.c7.s75">No one, who had not some good blood in their veins, would dare to be called Fitz; there was a deal in a name-- she had had a cousin who spelt his name with two little ffs-- ffoulkes--and he always looked down upon capital letters and said they belonged to lately-invented families.</s> <s sid="76" id="cran.c7.s76">She had been afraid he would die a bachelor, he was so very choice.</s> <s sid="77" id="cran.c7.s77">When he met with a Mrs ffarringdon, at a watering-place, he took to her immediately; and a very pretty genteel woman she was--a widow, with a very good fortune; and <alt-qs/>'my cousin,'<alt-qe/> Mr ffoulkes, married her; and it was all owing to her two little ffs."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="cran.c7.p23"><s sid="78" id="cran.c7.s78">Mrs Fitz-Adam did not stand a chance of meeting with a Mr Fitz- anything in Cranford, so that could not have been her motive for settling there.</s> <s sid="79" id="cran.c7.s79">Miss Matty thought it might have been the hope of being admitted into the society of the place, which would certainly be a very agreeable rise for ci-devant Miss Hoggins; and if this had been her hope it would be cruel to disappoint her.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="cran.c7.p24"><s sid="80" id="cran.c7.s80">So everybody called upon Mrs Fitz-Adam--everybody but Mrs Jamieson, who used to show how honourable she was by never seeing Mrs Fitz- Adam when they met at the Cranford parties.</s> <s sid="81" id="cran.c7.s81">There would be only eight or ten ladies in the room, and Mrs Fitz-Adam was the largest of all, and she invariably used to stand up when Mrs Jamieson came in, and curtsey very low to her whenever she turned in her direction--so low, in fact, that I think Mrs Jamieson must have looked at the wall above her, for she never moved a muscle of her face, no more than if she had not seen her.</s> <s sid="82" id="cran.c7.s82">Still Mrs Fitz-Adam persevered.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="cran.c7.p25" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="cran.c7.s83">The spring evenings were getting bright and long when three or four ladies in calashes met at Miss Barker's door.</s> <s sid="84" id="cran.c7.s84">Do you know what a calash is?</s> <s sid="85" id="cran.c7.s85">It is a covering worn over caps, not unlike the heads fastened on old-fashioned gigs; but sometimes it is not quite so large.</s> <s sid="86" id="cran.c7.s86">This kind of head-gear always made an awful impression on the children in Cranford; and now two or three left off their play in the quiet sunny little street, and gathered in wondering silence round Miss Pole, Miss Matty, and myself.</s> <s sid="87" id="cran.c7.s87">We were silent too, so that we could hear loud, suppressed whispers inside Miss Barker's house:</s> <s sid="88" id="cran.c7.s88"><qs/>"Wait, Peggy! wait till I've run upstairs and washed my hands.</s> <s sid="89" id="cran.c7.s89">When I cough, open the door; I'll not be a minute."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="cran.c7.p26" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="cran.c7.s90">And, true enough it was not a minute before we heard a noise, between a sneeze and a crow; on which the door flew open.</s> <s sid="91" id="cran.c7.s91">Behind it stood a round-eyed maiden, all aghast at the honourable company of calashes, who marched in without a word.</s> <s sid="92" id="cran.c7.s92">She recovered presence of mind enough to usher us into a small room, which had been the shop, but was now converted into a temporary dressing-room.</s> <s sid="93" id="cran.c7.s93">There we unpinned and shook ourselves, and arranged our features before the glass into a sweet and gracious company-face; and then, bowing backwards with <qs/>"After you, ma'am,"<qe/> we allowed Mrs Forrester to take precedence up the narrow staircase that led to Miss Barker's drawing-room.</s> <s sid="94" id="cran.c7.s94">There she sat, as stately and composed as though we had never heard that odd-sounding cough, from which her throat must have been even then sore and rough.</s> <s sid="95" id="cran.c7.s95">Kind, gentle, shabbily-dressed Mrs Forrester was immediately conducted to the second place of honour--a seat arranged something like Prince Albert's near the Queen's--good, but not so good.</s> <s sid="96" id="cran.c7.s96">The place of pre-eminence was, of course, reserved for the Honourable Mrs Jamieson, who presently came panting up the stairs--Carlo rushing round her on her progress, as if he meant to trip her up.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="cran.c7.p27" type="speech"><s sid="97" id="cran.c7.s97">And now Miss Betty Barker was a proud and happy woman!</s> <s sid="98" id="cran.c7.s98">She stirred the fire, and shut the door, and sat as near to it as she could, quite on the edge of her chair.</s> <s sid="99" id="cran.c7.s99">When Peggy came in, tottering under the weight of the tea-tray, I noticed that Miss Barker was sadly afraid lest Peggy should not keep her distance sufficiently.</s> <s sid="100" id="cran.c7.s100">She and her mistress were on very familiar terms in their every-day intercourse, and Peggy wanted now to make several little confidences to her, which Miss Barker was on thorns to hear, but which she thought it her duty, as a lady, to repress.</s> <s sid="101" id="cran.c7.s101">So she turned away from all Peggy's asides and signs; but she made one or two very malapropos answers to what was said; and at last, seized with a bright idea, she exclaimed, <qs/>"Poor, sweet Carlo!</s> <s sid="102" id="cran.c7.s102">I'm forgetting him.</s> <s sid="103" id="cran.c7.s103">Come downstairs with me, poor ittie doggie, and it shall have its tea, it shall!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="cran.c7.p28"><s sid="104" id="cran.c7.s104">In a few minutes she returned, bland and benignant as before; but I thought she had forgotten to give the "poor ittie doggie" anything to eat, judging by the avidity with which he swallowed down chance pieces of cake.</s> <s sid="105" id="cran.c7.s105">The tea-tray was abundantly loaded--I was pleased to see it, I was so hungry; but I was afraid the ladies present might think it vulgarly heaped up.</s> <s sid="106" id="cran.c7.s106">I know they would have done at their own houses; but somehow the heaps disappeared here.</s> <s sid="107" id="cran.c7.s107">I saw Mrs Jamieson eating seed-cake, slowly and considerately, as she did everything; and I was rather surprised, for I knew she had told us, on the occasion of her last party, that she never had it in her house, it reminded her so much of scented soap.</s> <s sid="108" id="cran.c7.s108">She always gave us Savoy biscuits.</s> <s sid="109" id="cran.c7.s109">However, Mrs Jamieson was kindly indulgent to Miss Barker's want of knowledge of the customs of high life; and, to spare her feelings, ate three large pieces of seed-cake, with a placid, ruminating expression of countenance, not unlike a cow's.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="cran.c7.p29" type="speech"><s sid="110" id="cran.c7.s110">After tea there was some little demur and difficulty.</s> <s sid="111" id="cran.c7.s111">We were six in number; four could play at Preference, and for the other two there was Cribbage.</s> <s sid="112" id="cran.c7.s112">But all, except myself (I was rather afraid of the Cranford ladies at cards, for it was the most earnest and serious business they ever engaged in), were anxious to be of the <qs/>"pool."<qe/></s> <s sid="113" id="cran.c7.s113">Even Miss Barker, while declaring she did not know Spadille from Manille, was evidently hankering to take a hand.</s> <s sid="114" id="cran.c7.s114">The dilemma was soon put an end to by a singular kind of noise.</s> <s sid="115" id="cran.c7.s115">If a baron's daughter-in-law could ever be supposed to snore, I should have said Mrs Jamieson did so then; for, overcome by the heat of the room, and inclined to doze by nature, the temptation of that very comfortable arm-chair had been too much for her, and Mrs Jamieson was nodding.</s> <s sid="116" id="cran.c7.s116">Once or twice she opened her eyes with an effort, and calmly but unconsciously smiled upon us; but by-and-by, even her benevolence was not equal to this exertion, and she was sound asleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="cran.c7.p30" type="speech"><s sid="117" id="cran.c7.s117"><qs/>"It is very gratifying to me,"<qe/><sls/> whispered Miss Barker at the card- table to her three opponents, whom, notwithstanding her ignorance of the game, she was "basting" most unmercifully--<sle/><qs/>"very gratifying indeed, to see how completely Mrs Jamieson feels at home in my poor little dwelling; she could not have paid me a greater compliment."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="cran.c8.p5"><s sid="17" id="cran.c8.s17">It was very certain Miss Pole would obtain no wise decision from Miss Matty, who got more bewildered every moment, and more perplexed as to etiquettes of address.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="cran.c8.p10"><s sid="28" id="cran.c8.s28">It was really a relief to Miss Matty when Mrs Jamieson came on a very unpolite errand.</s> <s sid="29" id="cran.c8.s29">I notice that apathetic people have more quiet impertinence than others; and Mrs Jamieson came now to insinuate pretty plainly that she did not particularly wish that the Cranford ladies should call upon her sister-in-law.</s> <s sid="30" id="cran.c8.s30">I can hardly say how she made this clear; for I grew very indignant and warm, while with slow deliberation she was explaining her wishes to Miss Matty, who, a true lady herself, could hardly understand the feeling which made Mrs Jamieson wish to appear to her noble sister- in-law as if she only visited "county" families.</s> <s sid="31" id="cran.c8.s31">Miss Matty remained puzzled and perplexed long after I had found out the object of Mrs Jamieson's visit.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="cran.c8.p11"><s sid="32" id="cran.c8.s32">When she did understand the drift of the honourable lady's call, it was pretty to see with what quiet dignity she received the intimation thus uncourteously given.</s> <s sid="33" id="cran.c8.s33">She was not in the least hurt--she was of too gentle a spirit for that; nor was she exactly conscious of disapproving of Mrs Jamieson's conduct; but there was something of this feeling in her mind, I am sure, which made her pass from the subject to others in a less flurried and more composed manner than usual.</s> <s sid="34" id="cran.c8.s34">Mrs Jamieson was, indeed, the more flurried of the two, and I could see she was glad to take her leave.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="cran.c8.p12" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="cran.c8.s35">A little while afterwards Miss Pole returned, red and indignant.</s> <s sid="36" id="cran.c8.s36"><qs/>"Well! to be sure!</s> <s sid="37" id="cran.c8.s37">You've had Mrs Jamieson here, I find from Martha; and we are not to call on Lady Glenmire.</s> <s sid="38" id="cran.c8.s38">Yes!</s> <s sid="39" id="cran.c8.s39">I met Mrs Jamieson, half-way between here and Mrs Forrester's, and she told me; she took me so by surprise, I had nothing to say.</s> <s sid="40" id="cran.c8.s40">I wish I had thought of something very sharp and sarcastic; I dare say I shall to-night.</s> <s sid="41" id="cran.c8.s41">And Lady Glenmire is but the widow of a Scotch baron after all!</s> <s sid="42" id="cran.c8.s42">I went on to look at Mrs Forrester's Peerage, to see who this lady was, that is to be kept under a glass case:  widow of a Scotch peer--never sat in the House of Lords--and as poor as job, I dare say; and she--fifth daughter of some Mr Campbell or other.</s> <s sid="43" id="cran.c8.s43">You are the daughter of a rector, at any rate, and related to the Arleys; and Sir Peter might have been Viscount Arley, every one says."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="cran.c8.p17" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="cran.c8.s55">Miss Pole said, <qs/>"Good gracious me! as if we cared about a Mrs Smith;"<qe/> but was silent as Martha resumed her speech.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="cran.c8.p19" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="cran.c8.s59"><qs/>"Hush, Martha!"<qe/><sss/> said Miss Matty, <sse/><qs/>"that's not respectful."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="cran.c8.p23"><s sid="65" id="cran.c8.s65">Another Sunday passed away, and we still averted our eyes from Mrs Jamieson and her guest, and made remarks to ourselves that we thought were very severe--almost too much so.</s> <s sid="66" id="cran.c8.s66">Miss Matty was evidently uneasy at our sarcastic manner of speaking.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="cran.c8.p24"><s sid="67" id="cran.c8.s67">Perhaps by this time Lady Glenmire had found out that Mrs Jamieson's was not the gayest, liveliest house in the world; perhaps Mrs Jamieson had found out that most of the county families were in London, and that those who remained in the country were not so alive as they might have been to the circumstance of Lady Glenmire being in their neighbourhood.</s> <s sid="68" id="cran.c8.s68">Great events spring out of small causes; so I will not pretend to say what induced Mrs Jamieson to alter her determination of excluding the Cranford ladies, and send notes of invitation all round for a small party on the following Tuesday.</s> <s sid="69" id="cran.c8.s69">Mr Mulliner himself brought them round.</s> <s sid="70" id="cran.c8.s70">He WOULD always ignore the fact of there being a back-door to any house, and gave a louder rat-tat than his mistress, Mrs Jamieson.</s> <s sid="71" id="cran.c8.s71">He had three little notes, which he carried in a large basket, in order to impress his mistress with an idea of their great weight, though they might easily have gone into his waistcoat pocket.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="cran.c8.p25"><s sid="72" id="cran.c8.s72">Miss Matty and I quietly decided that we would have a previous engagement at home:  it was the evening on which Miss Matty usually made candle-lighters of all the notes and letters of the week; for on Mondays her accounts were always made straight--not a penny owing from the week before; so, by a natural arrangement, making candle-lighters fell upon a Tuesday evening, and gave us a legitimate excuse for declining Mrs Jamieson's invitation.</s> <s sid="73" id="cran.c8.s73">But before our answer was written, in came Miss Pole, with an open note in her hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="cran.c8.p26" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="cran.c8.s74"><qs/>"So!"<qe/> she said.</s> <s sid="75" id="cran.c8.s75"><qs/>"Ah!</s> <s sid="76" id="cran.c8.s76">I see you have got your note, too.</s> <s sid="77" id="cran.c8.s77">Better late than never.</s> <s sid="78" id="cran.c8.s78">I could have told my Lady Glenmire she would be glad enough of our society before a fortnight was over."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="cran.c8.p27" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="cran.c8.s79"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/><sss/> said Miss Matty, <sse/><qs/>"we're asked for Tuesday evening.</s> <s sid="80" id="cran.c8.s80">And perhaps you would just kindly bring your work across and drink tea with us that night.</s> <s sid="81" id="cran.c8.s81">It is my usual regular time for looking over the last week's bills, and notes, and letters, and making candle- lighters of them; but that does not seem quite reason enough for saying I have a previous engagement at home, though I meant to make it do.</s> <s sid="82" id="cran.c8.s82">Now, if you would come, my conscience would be quite at ease, and luckily the note is not written yet."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="cran.c8.p30" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="cran.c8.s85"><qs/>"Oh, no!"<qe/> said, Miss Matty quietly.</s> <s sid="86" id="cran.c8.s86"><qs/>"You don't either, I suppose?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="cran.c8.p31" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="cran.c8.s87"><qs/>"I don't know,"<qe/> replied Miss Pole.</s> <s sid="88" id="cran.c8.s88"><qs/>"Yes, I think I do,"<qe/><sls/> said she, rather briskly; and on seeing Miss Matty look surprised, she added, <sle/><qs/>"You see, one would not like Mrs Jamieson to think that anything she could do, or say, was of consequence enough to give offence; it would be a kind of letting down of ourselves, that I, for one, should not like.</s> <s sid="89" id="cran.c8.s89">It would be too flattering to Mrs Jamieson if we allowed her to suppose that what she had said affected us a week, nay ten days afterwards."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="cran.c8.p35" type="speech"><s sid="97" id="cran.c8.s97">But Miss Pole, in addition to her delicacies of feeling, possessed a very smart cap, which she was anxious to show to an admiring world; and so she seemed to forget all her angry words uttered not a fortnight before, and to be ready to act on what she called the great Christian principle of "Forgive and forget"; and she lectured dear Miss Matty so long on this head that she absolutely ended by assuring her it was her duty, as a deceased rector's daughter, to buy a new cap and go to the party at Mrs Jamieson's.</s> <s sid="98" id="cran.c8.s98">So <qs/>"we were most happy to accept,"<qe/><sss/> instead of <sse/><qs/>"regretting that we were obliged to decline."<qe/></s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER IX--SIGNOR BRUNONI</title>

<p pid="1" id="cran.c9.p1"><s sid="1" id="cran.c9.s1">Soon after the events of which I gave an account in my last paper, I was summoned home by my father's illness; and for a time I forgot, in anxiety about him, to wonder how my dear friends at Cranford were getting on, or how Lady Glenmire could reconcile herself to the dulness of the long visit which she was still paying to her sister-in-law, Mrs Jamieson.</s> <s sid="2" id="cran.c9.s2">When my father grew a little stronger I accompanied him to the seaside, so that altogether I seemed banished from Cranford, and was deprived of the opportunity of hearing any chance intelligence of the dear little town for the greater part of that year.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="cran.c9.p2"><s sid="3" id="cran.c9.s3">Late in November--when we had returned home again, and my father was once more in good health--I received a letter from Miss Matty; and a very mysterious letter it was.</s> <s sid="4" id="cran.c9.s4">She began many sentences without ending them, running them one into another, in much the same confused sort of way in which written words run together on blotting-paper.</s> <s sid="5" id="cran.c9.s5">All I could make out was that, if my father was better (which she hoped he was), and would take warning and wear a great-coat from Michaelmas to Lady-day, if turbans were in fashion, could I tell her?</s> <s sid="6" id="cran.c9.s6">Such a piece of gaiety was going to happen as had not been seen or known of since Wombwell's lions came, when one of them ate a little child's arm; and she was, perhaps, too old to care about dress, but a new cap she must have; and, having heard that turbans were worn, and some of the county families likely to come, she would like to look tidy, if I would bring her a cap from the milliner I employed; and oh, dear! how careless of her to forget that she wrote to beg I would come and pay her a visit next Tuesday; when she hoped to have something to offer me in the way of amusement, which she would not now more particularly describe, only sea-green was her favourite colour.</s> <s sid="7" id="cran.c9.s7">So she ended her letter; but in a P.S. she added, she thought she might as well tell me what was the peculiar attraction to Cranford just now; Signor Brunoni was going to exhibit his wonderful magic in the Cranford Assembly Rooms on Wednesday and Friday evening in the following week.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="cran.c9.p12"><s sid="58" id="cran.c9.s58">Mrs Forrester implored Miss Pole to spare her, saying, from a child upwards, she never could understand being read aloud to; and I dropped the pack of cards, which I had been shuffling very audibly, and by this discreet movement I obliged Miss Pole to perceive that Preference was to have been the order of the evening, and to propose, rather unwillingly, that the pool should commence.</s> <s sid="59" id="cran.c9.s59">The pleasant brightness that stole over the other two ladies' faces on this!</s> <s sid="60" id="cran.c9.s60">Miss Matty had one or two twinges of self-reproach for having interrupted Miss Pole in her studies:  and did not remember her cards well, or give her full attention to the game, until she had soothed her conscience by offering to lend the volume of the Encyclopaedia to Miss Pole, who accepted it thankfully, and said Betty should take it home when she came with the lantern.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="cran.c9.p13" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="cran.c9.s61">The next evening we were all in a little gentle flutter at the idea of the gaiety before us.</s> <s sid="62" id="cran.c9.s62">Miss Matty went up to dress betimes, and hurried me until I was ready, when we found we had an hour-and-a- half to wait before the <qs/>"doors opened at seven precisely."<qe/></s> <s sid="63" id="cran.c9.s63">And we had only twenty yards to go!</s> <s sid="64" id="cran.c9.s64">However, as Miss Matty said, it would not do to get too much absorbed in anything, and forget the time; so she thought we had better sit quietly, without lighting the candles, till five minutes to seven.</s> <s sid="65" id="cran.c9.s65">So Miss Matty dozed, and I knitted.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="cran.c9.p14" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="cran.c9.s66">At length we set off; and at the door under the carriage-way at the <qs/>"George,"<qe/> we met Mrs Forrester and Miss Pole:  the latter was discussing the subject of the evening with more vehemence than ever, and throwing X's and B's at our heads like hailstones.</s> <s sid="67" id="cran.c9.s67">She had even copied one or two of the <qs/>"receipts"<qe/>--as she called them-- for the different tricks, on backs of letters, ready to explain and to detect Signor Brunoni's arts.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="cran.c9.p15"><s sid="68" id="cran.c9.s68">We went into the cloak-room adjoining the Assembly Room; Miss Matty gave a sigh or two to her departed youth, and the remembrance of the last time she had been there, as she adjusted her pretty new cap before the strange, quaint old mirror in the cloak-room.</s> <s sid="69" id="cran.c9.s69">The Assembly Room had been added to the inn, about a hundred years before, by the different county families, who met together there once a month during the winter to dance and play at cards.</s> <s sid="70" id="cran.c9.s70">Many a county beauty had first swung through the minuet that she afterwards danced before Queen Charlotte in this very room.</s> <s sid="71" id="cran.c9.s71">It was said that one of the Gunnings had graced the apartment with her beauty; it was certain that a rich and beautiful widow, Lady Williams, had here been smitten with the noble figure of a young artist, who was staying with some family in the neighbourhood for professional purposes, and accompanied his patrons to the Cranford Assembly.</s> <s sid="72" id="cran.c9.s72">And a pretty bargain poor Lady Williams had of her handsome husband, if all tales were true.</s> <s sid="73" id="cran.c9.s73">Now, no beauty blushed and dimpled along the sides of the Cranford Assembly Room; no handsome artist won hearts by his bow, chapeau bras in hand; the old room was dingy; the salmon-coloured paint had faded into a drab; great pieces of plaster had chipped off from the fine wreaths and festoons on its walls; but still a mouldy odour of aristocracy lingered about the place, and a dusty recollection of the days that were gone made Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester bridle up as they entered, and walk mincingly up the room, as if there were a number of genteel observers, instead of two little boys with a stick of toffee between them with which to beguile the time.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="cran.c9.p16" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="cran.c9.s74">We stopped short at the second front row; I could hardly understand why, until I heard Miss Pole ask a stray waiter if any of the county families were expected; and when he shook his head, and believed not, Mrs Forrester and Miss Matty moved forwards, and our party represented a conversational square.</s> <s sid="75" id="cran.c9.s75">The front row was soon augmented and enriched by Lady Glenmire and Mrs Jamieson.</s> <s sid="76" id="cran.c9.s76">We six occupied the two front rows, and our aristocratic seclusion was respected by the groups of shop-keepers who strayed in from time to time and huddled together on the back benches.</s> <s sid="77" id="cran.c9.s77">At least I conjectured so, from the noise they made, and the sonorous bumps they gave in sitting down; but when, in weariness of the obstinate green curtain that would not draw up, but would stare at me with two odd eyes, seen through holes, as in the old tapestry story, I would fain have looked round at the merry chattering people behind me, Miss Pole clutched my arm, and begged me not to turn, for <qs/>"it was not the thing."<qe/></s> <s sid="78" id="cran.c9.s78">What "the thing" was, I never could find out, but it must have been something eminently dull and tiresome.</s> <s sid="79" id="cran.c9.s79">However, we all sat eyes right, square front, gazing at the tantalising curtain, and hardly speaking intelligibly, we were so afraid of being caught in the vulgarity of making any noise in a place of public amusement.</s> <s sid="80" id="cran.c9.s80">Mrs Jamieson was the most fortunate, for she fell asleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="cran.c9.p17" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="cran.c9.s81">At length the eyes disappeared--the curtain quivered--one side went up before the other, which stuck fast; it was dropped again, and, with a fresh effort, and a vigorous pull from some unseen hand, it flew up, revealing to our sight a magnificent gentleman in the Turkish costume, seated before a little table, gazing at us (I should have said with the same eyes that I had last seen through the hole in the curtain) with calm and condescending dignity, <qs/>"like a being of another sphere,"<qe/> as I heard a sentimental voice ejaculate behind me.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="cran.c9.p18" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="cran.c9.s82"><qs/>"That's not Signor Brunoni!"<qe/> said Miss Pole decidedly; and so audibly that I am sure he heard, for he glanced down over his flowing beard at our party with an air of mute reproach.</s> <s sid="83" id="cran.c9.s83"><qs/>"Signor Brunoni had no beard--but perhaps he'll come soon."<qe/></s> <s sid="84" id="cran.c9.s84">So she lulled herself into patience.</s> <s sid="85" id="cran.c9.s85">Meanwhile, Miss Matty had reconnoitred through her eye-glass, wiped it, and looked again.</s> <s sid="86" id="cran.c9.s86">Then she turned round, and said to me, in a kind, mild, sorrowful tone -</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="cran.c9.p20"><s sid="88" id="cran.c9.s88">But we had no time for more conversation.</s> <s sid="89" id="cran.c9.s89">The Grand Turk, as Miss Pole chose to call him, arose and announced himself as Signor Brunoni.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="cran.c9.p22"><s sid="94" id="cran.c9.s94">Miss Pole's energetic speeches had the good effect of wakening up Mrs Jamieson, who opened her eyes wide, in sign of the deepest attention--a proceeding which silenced Miss Pole and encouraged the Grand Turk to proceed, which he did in very broken English--so broken that there was no cohesion between the parts of his sentences; a fact which he himself perceived at last, and so left off speaking and proceeded to action.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="cran.c9.p23"><s sid="95" id="cran.c9.s95">Now we WERE astonished.</s> <s sid="96" id="cran.c9.s96">How he did his tricks I could not imagine; no, not even when Miss Pole pulled out her pieces of paper and began reading aloud--or at least in a very audible whisper--the separate "receipts" for the most common of his tricks.</s> <s sid="97" id="cran.c9.s97">If ever I saw a man frown and look enraged, I saw the Grand Turk frown at Miss Pole; but, as she said, what could be expected but unchristian looks from a Mussulman?</s> <s sid="98" id="cran.c9.s98">If Miss Pole were sceptical, and more engrossed with her receipts and diagrams than with his tricks, Miss Matty and Mrs Forrester were mystified and perplexed to the highest degree.</s> <s sid="99" id="cran.c9.s99">Mrs Jamieson kept taking her spectacles off and wiping them, as if she thought it was something defective in them which made the legerdemain; and Lady Glenmire, who had seen many curious sights in Edinburgh, was very much struck with the tricks, and would not at all agree with Miss Pole, who declared that anybody could do them with a little practice, and that she would, herself, undertake to do all he did, with two hours given to study the Encyclopaedia and make her third finger flexible.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER X--THE PANIC</title>

<p pid="11" id="cran.c10.p11"><s sid="43" id="cran.c10.s43">One of the stories that haunted me for a long time afterwards was of a girl who was left in charge of a great house in Cumberland on some particular fair-day, when the other servants all went off to the gaieties.</s> <s sid="44" id="cran.c10.s44">The family were away in London, and a pedlar came by, and asked to leave his large and heavy pack in the kitchen, saying he would call for it again at night; and the girl (a gamekeeper's daughter), roaming about in search of amusement, chanced to hit upon a gun hanging up in the hall, and took it down to look at the chasing; and it went off through the open kitchen door, hit the pack, and a slow dark thread of blood came oozing out.</s> <s sid="45" id="cran.c10.s45">(How Miss Pole enjoyed this part of the story, dwelling on each word as if she loved it!)</s> <s sid="46" id="cran.c10.s46">She rather hurried over the further account of the girl's bravery, and I have but a confused idea that, somehow, she baffled the robbers with Italian irons, heated red- hot, and then restored to blackness by being dipped in grease.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="cran.c10.p16"><s sid="59" id="cran.c10.s59">Poor Carlo! his barking days were nearly over.</s> <s sid="60" id="cran.c10.s60">Whether the gang who infested the neighbourhood were afraid of him, or whether they were revengeful enough, for the way in which he had baffled them on the night in question, to poison him; or whether, as some among the more uneducated people thought, he died of apoplexy, brought on by too much feeding and too little exercise; at any rate, it is certain that, two days after this eventful night, Carlo was found dead, with his poor legs stretched out stiff in the attitude of running, as if by such unusual exertion he could escape the sure pursuer, Death.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="cran.c10.p17"><s sid="61" id="cran.c10.s61">We were all sorry for Carlo, the old familiar friend who had snapped at us for so many years; and the mysterious mode of his death made us very uncomfortable.</s> <s sid="62" id="cran.c10.s62">Could Signor Brunoni be at the bottom of this?</s> <s sid="63" id="cran.c10.s63">He had apparently killed a canary with only a word of command; his will seemed of deadly force; who knew but what he might yet be lingering in the neighbourhood willing all sorts of awful things!</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="cran.c10.p18"><s sid="64" id="cran.c10.s64">We whispered these fancies among ourselves in the evenings; but in the mornings our courage came back with the daylight, and in a week's time we had got over the shock of Carlo's death; all but Mrs Jamieson.</s> <s sid="65" id="cran.c10.s65">She, poor thing, felt it as she had felt no event since her husband's death; indeed, Miss Pole said, that as the Honourable Mr Jamieson drank a good deal, and occasioned her much uneasiness, it was possible that Carlo's death might be the greater affliction.</s> <s sid="66" id="cran.c10.s66">But there was always a tinge of cynicism in Miss Pole's remarks.</s> <s sid="67" id="cran.c10.s67">However, one thing was clear and certain--it was necessary for Mrs Jamieson to have some change of scene; and Mr Mulliner was very impressive on this point, shaking his head whenever we inquired after his mistress, and speaking of her loss of appetite and bad nights very ominously; and with justice too, for if she had two characteristics in her natural state of health they were a facility of eating and sleeping.</s> <s sid="68" id="cran.c10.s68">If she could neither eat nor sleep, she must be indeed out of spirits and out of health.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="cran.c10.p19"><s sid="69" id="cran.c10.s69">Lady Glenmire (who had evidently taken very kindly to Cranford) did not like the idea of Mrs Jamieson's going to Cheltenham, and more than once insinuated pretty plainly that it was Mr Mulliner's doing, who had been much alarmed on the occasion of the house being attacked, and since had said, more than once, that he felt it a very responsible charge to have to defend so many women.</s> <s sid="70" id="cran.c10.s70">Be that as it might, Mrs Jamieson went to Cheltenham, escorted by Mr Mulliner; and Lady Glenmire remained in possession of the house, her ostensible office being to take care that the maid-servants did not pick up followers.</s> <s sid="71" id="cran.c10.s71">She made a very pleasant-looking dragon; and, as soon as it was arranged for her stay in Cranford, she found out that Mrs Jamieson's visit to Cheltenham was just the best thing in the world.</s> <s sid="72" id="cran.c10.s72">She had let her house in Edinburgh, and was for the time house-less, so the charge of her sister-in-law's comfortable abode was very convenient and acceptable.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="cran.c11.p2" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="cran.c11.s5">In the afternoon Miss Pole called on Miss Matty to tell her of the adventure--the real adventure they had met with on their morning's walk.</s> <s sid="6" id="cran.c11.s6">They had been perplexed about the exact path which they were to take across the fields in order to find the knitting old woman, and had stopped to inquire at a little wayside public-house, standing on the high road to London, about three miles from Cranford.</s> <s sid="7" id="cran.c11.s7">The good woman had asked them to sit down and rest themselves while she fetched her husband, who could direct them better than she could; and, while they were sitting in the sanded parlour, a little girl came in.</s> <s sid="8" id="cran.c11.s8">They thought that she belonged to the landlady, and began some trifling conversation with her; but, on Mrs Roberts's return, she told them that the little thing was the only child of a couple who were staying in the house.</s> <s sid="9" id="cran.c11.s9">And then she began a long story, out of which Lady Glenmire and Miss Pole could only gather one or two decided facts, which were that, about six weeks ago, a light spring-cart had broken down just before their door, in which there were two men, one woman, and this child.</s> <s sid="10" id="cran.c11.s10">One of the men was seriously hurt--no bones broken, only <qs/>"shaken,"<qe/> the landlady called it; but he had probably sustained some severe internal injury, for he had languished in their house ever since, attended by his wife, the mother of this little girl.</s> <s sid="11" id="cran.c11.s11">Miss Pole had asked what he was, what he looked like.</s> <s sid="12" id="cran.c11.s12">And Mrs Roberts had made answer that he was not like a gentleman, nor yet like a common person; if it had not been that he and his wife were such decent, quiet people, she could almost have thought he was a mountebank, or something of that kind, for they had a great box in the cart, full of she did not know what.</s> <s sid="13" id="cran.c11.s13">She had helped to unpack it, and take out their linen and clothes, when the other man--his twin-brother, she believed he was--had gone off with the horse and cart.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="cran.c11.p3" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="cran.c11.s14">Miss Pole had begun to have her suspicions at this point, and expressed her idea that it was rather strange that the box and cart and horse and all should have disappeared; but good Mrs Roberts seemed to have become quite indignant at Miss Pole's implied suggestion; in fact, Miss Pole said she was as angry as if Miss Pole had told her that she herself was a swindler.</s> <s sid="15" id="cran.c11.s15">As the best way of convincing the ladies, she bethought her of begging them to see the wife; and, as Miss Pole said, there was no doubting the honest, worn, bronzed face of the woman, who at the first tender word from Lady Glenmire, burst into tears, which she was too weak to check until some word from the landlady made her swallow down her sobs, in order that she might testify to the Christian kindness shown by Mr and Mrs Roberts.</s> <s sid="16" id="cran.c11.s16">Miss Pole came round with a swing to as vehement a belief in the sorrowful tale as she had been sceptical before; and, as a proof of this, her energy in the poor sufferer's behalf was nothing daunted when she found out that he, and no other, was our Signor Brunoni, to whom all Cranford had been attributing all manner of evil this six weeks past!</s> <s sid="17" id="cran.c11.s17">Yes! his wife said his proper name was Samuel Brown--<qs/>"Sam,"<qe/> she called him--but to the last we preferred calling him "the Signor"; it sounded so much better.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="cran.c11.p4"><s sid="18" id="cran.c11.s18">The end of their conversation with the Signora Brunoni was that it was agreed that he should be placed under medical advice, and for any expense incurred in procuring this Lady Glenmire promised to hold herself responsible, and had accordingly gone to Mr Hoggins to beg him to ride over to the "Rising Sun" that very afternoon, and examine into the signor's real state; and, as Miss Pole said, if it was desirable to remove him to Cranford to be more immediately under Mr Hoggins's eye, she would undertake to see for lodgings and arrange about the rent.</s> <s sid="19" id="cran.c11.s19">Mrs Roberts had been as kind as could be all throughout, but it was evident that their long residence there had been a slight inconvenience.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="cran.c11.p5" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="cran.c11.s20">Before Miss Pole left us, Miss Matty and I were as full of the morning's adventure as she was.</s> <s sid="21" id="cran.c11.s21">We talked about it all the evening, turning it in every possible light, and we went to bed anxious for the morning, when we should surely hear from someone what Mr Hoggins thought and recommended; for, as Miss Matty observed, though Mr Hoggins did say <qs/>"Jack's up,"<qe/><sls/> "a fig for his heels," and called Preference <sle/><qs/>"Pref."<qe/> she believed he was a very worthy man and a very clever surgeon.</s> <s sid="22" id="cran.c11.s22">Indeed, we were rather proud of our doctor at Cranford, as a doctor.</s> <s sid="23" id="cran.c11.s23">We often wished, when we heard of Queen Adelaide or the Duke of Wellington being ill, that they would send for Mr Hoggins; but, on consideration, we were rather glad they did not, for, if we were ailing, what should we do if Mr Hoggins had been appointed physician-in-ordinary to the Royal Family?</s> <s sid="24" id="cran.c11.s24">As a surgeon we were proud of him; but as a man--or rather, I should say, as a gentleman--we could only shake our heads over his name and himself, and wished that he had read Lord Chesterfield's Letters in the days when his manners were susceptible of improvement.</s> <s sid="25" id="cran.c11.s25">Nevertheless, we all regarded his dictum in the signor's case as infallible, and when he said that with care and attention he might rally, we had no more fear for him.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="cran.c11.p6" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="cran.c11.s26">But, although we had no more fear, everybody did as much as if there was great cause for anxiety--as indeed there was until Mr Hoggins took charge of him.</s> <s sid="27" id="cran.c11.s27">Miss Pole looked out clean and comfortable, if homely, lodgings; Miss Matty sent the sedan-chair for him, and Martha and I aired it well before it left Cranford by holding a warming-pan full of red-hot coals in it, and then shutting it up close, smoke and all, until the time when he should get into it at the <qs/>"Rising Sun."<qe/></s> <s sid="28" id="cran.c11.s28">Lady Glenmire undertook the medical department under Mr Hoggins's directions, and rummaged up all Mrs Jamieson's medicine glasses, and spoons, and bed-tables, in a free-and-easy way, that made Miss Matty feel a little anxious as to what that lady and Mr Mulliner might say, if they knew.</s> <s sid="29" id="cran.c11.s29">Mrs Forrester made some of the bread-jelly, for which she was so famous, to have ready as a refreshment in the lodgings when he should arrive.</s> <s sid="30" id="cran.c11.s30">A present of this bread-jelly was the highest mark of favour dear Mrs Forrester could confer.</s> <s sid="31" id="cran.c11.s31">Miss Pole had once asked her for the receipt, but she had met with a very decided rebuff; that lady told her that she could not part with it to any one during her life, and that after her death it was bequeathed, as her executors would find, to Miss Matty.</s> <s sid="32" id="cran.c11.s32">What Miss Matty, or, as Mrs Forrester called her (remembering the clause in her will and the dignity of the occasion), Miss Matilda Jenkyns--might choose to do with the receipt when it came into her possession--whether to make it public, or to hand it down as an heirloom--she did not know, nor would she dictate.</s> <s sid="33" id="cran.c11.s33">And a mould of this admirable, digestible, unique bread-jelly was sent by Mrs Forrester to our poor sick conjuror.</s> <s sid="34" id="cran.c11.s34">Who says that the aristocracy are proud?</s> <s sid="35" id="cran.c11.s35">Here was a lady by birth a Tyrrell, and descended from the great Sir Walter that shot King Rufus, and in whose veins ran the blood of him who murdered the little princes in the Tower, going every day to see what dainty dishes she could prepare for Samuel Brown, a mountebank!</s> <s sid="36" id="cran.c11.s36">But, indeed, it was wonderful to see what kind feelings were called out by this poor man's coming amongst us.</s> <s sid="37" id="cran.c11.s37">And also wonderful to see how the great Cranford panic, which had been occasioned by his first coming in his Turkish dress, melted away into thin air on his second coming--pale and feeble, and with his heavy, filmy eyes, that only brightened a very little when they fell upon the countenance of his faithful wife, or their pale and sorrowful little girl.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="cran.c11.p7"><s sid="38" id="cran.c11.s38">Somehow we all forgot to be afraid.</s> <s sid="39" id="cran.c11.s39">I daresay it was that finding out that he, who had first excited our love of the marvellous by his unprecedented arts, had not sufficient every-day gifts to manage a shying horse, made us feel as if we were ourselves again.</s> <s sid="40" id="cran.c11.s40">Miss Pole came with her little basket at all hours of the evening, as if her lonely house and the unfrequented road to it had never been infested by that "murderous gang"; Mrs Forrester said she thought that neither Jenny nor she need mind the headless lady who wept and wailed in Darkness Lane, for surely the power was never given to such beings to harm those who went about to try to do what little good was in their power, to which Jenny tremblingly assented; but the mistress's theory had little effect on the maid's practice until she had sewn two pieces of red flannel in the shape of a cross on her inner garment.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="cran.c11.p8"><s sid="41" id="cran.c11.s41">I found Miss Matty covering her penny ball--the ball that she used to roll under her bed--with gay-coloured worsted in rainbow stripes.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="cran.c11.p10" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="cran.c11.s46">We were all of us far too full of the signor's precarious state to talk either about robbers or ghosts.</s> <s sid="47" id="cran.c11.s47">Indeed, Lady Glenmire said she never had heard of any actual robberies, except that two little boys had stolen some apples from Farmer Benson's orchard, and that some eggs had been missed on a market-day off Widow Hayward's stall.</s> <s sid="48" id="cran.c11.s48">But that was expecting too much of us; we could not acknowledge that we had only had this small foundation for all our panic.</s> <s sid="49" id="cran.c11.s49">Miss Pole drew herself up at this remark of Lady Glenmire's, and said <qs/>"that she wished she could agree with her as to the very small reason we had had for alarm, but with the recollection of a man disguised as a woman who had endeavoured to force himself into her house while his confederates waited outside; with the knowledge gained from Lady Glenmire herself, of the footprints seen on Mrs Jamieson's flower borders; with the fact before her of the audacious robbery committed on Mr Hoggins at his own door"<qe/><sls/>--But here Lady Glenmire broke in with a very strong expression of doubt as to whether this last story was not an entire fabrication founded upon the theft of a cat; she grew so red while she was saying all this that I was not surprised at Miss Pole's manner of bridling up, and I am certain, if Lady Glenmire had not been <sle/><qs/>"her ladyship,"<qe/><sls/> we should have had a more emphatic contradiction than the <sle/><qs/>"Well, to be sure!"<qe/> and similar fragmentary ejaculations, which were all that she ventured upon in my lady's presence.</s> <s sid="50" id="cran.c11.s50">But when she was gone Miss Pole began a long congratulation to Miss Matty that so far they had escaped marriage, which she noticed always made people credulous to the last degree; indeed, she thought it argued great natural credulity in a woman if she could not keep herself from being married; and in what Lady Glenmire had said about Mr Hoggins's robbery we had a specimen of what people came to if they gave way to such a weakness; evidently Lady Glenmire would swallow anything if she could believe the poor vamped-up story about a neck of mutton and a pussy with which he had tried to impose on Miss Pole, only she had always been on her guard against believing too much of what men said.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="cran.c11.p11"><s sid="51" id="cran.c11.s51">We were thankful, as Miss Pole desired us to be, that we had never been married; but I think, of the two, we were even more thankful that the robbers had left Cranford; at least I judge so from a speech of Miss Matty's that evening, as we sat over the fire, in which she evidently looked upon a husband as a great protector against thieves, burglars, and ghosts; and said that she did not think that she should dare to be always warning young people against matrimony, as Miss Pole did continually; to be sure, marriage was a risk, as she saw, now she had had some experience; but she remembered the time when she had looked forward to being married as much as any one.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="cran.c12.p4" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="cran.c12.s18">The only fact I gained from this conversation was that certainly Peter had last been heard of in India, "or that neighbourhood"; and that this scanty intelligence of his whereabouts had reached Cranford in the year when Miss Pole had brought her Indian muslin gown, long since worn out (we washed it and mended it, and traced its decline and fall into a window-blind before we could go on); and in a year when Wombwell came to Cranford, because Miss Matty had wanted to see an elephant in order that she might the better imagine Peter riding on one; and had seen a boa-constrictor too, which was more than she wished to imagine in her fancy-pictures of Peter's locality; and in a year when Miss Jenkyns had learnt some piece of poetry off by heart, and used to say, at all the Cranford parties, how Peter was <qs/>"surveying mankind from China to Peru,"<qe/> which everybody had thought very grand, and rather appropriate, because India was between China and Peru, if you took care to turn the globe to the left instead of the right.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="cran.c13.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="cran.c13.s1">The very Tuesday morning on which Mr Johnson was going to show the fashions, the post-woman brought two letters to the house.</s> <s sid="2" id="cran.c13.s2">I say the post-woman, but I should say the postman's wife.</s> <s sid="3" id="cran.c13.s3">He was a lame shoemaker, a very clean, honest man, much respected in the town; but he never brought the letters round except on unusual occasions, such as Christmas Day or Good Friday; and on those days the letters, which should have been delivered at eight in the morning, did not make their appearance until two or three in the afternoon, for every one liked poor Thomas, and gave him a welcome on these festive occasions.</s> <s sid="4" id="cran.c13.s4">He used to say, <qs/>"He was welly stawed wi' eating, for there were three or four houses where nowt would serve 'em but he must share in their breakfast;"<qe/> and by the time he had done his last breakfast, he came to some other friend who was beginning dinner; but come what might in the way of temptation, Tom was always sober, civil, and smiling; and, as Miss Jenkyns used to say, it was a lesson in patience, that she doubted not would call out that precious quality in some minds, where, but for Thomas, it might have lain dormant and undiscovered.</s> <s sid="5" id="cran.c13.s5">Patience was certainly very dormant in Miss Jenkyns's mind.</s> <s sid="6" id="cran.c13.s6">She was always expecting letters, and always drumming on the table till the post-woman had called or gone past.</s> <s sid="7" id="cran.c13.s7">On Christmas Day and Good Friday she drummed from breakfast till church, from church-time till two o'clock-- unless when the fire wanted stirring, when she invariably knocked down the fire-irons, and scolded Miss Matty for it.</s> <s sid="8" id="cran.c13.s8">But equally certain was the hearty welcome and the good dinner for Thomas; Miss Jenkyns standing over him like a bold dragoon, questioning him as to his children--what they were doing--what school they went to; upbraiding him if another was likely to make its appearance, but sending even the little babies the shilling and the mince-pie which was her gift to all the children, with half-a-crown in addition for both father and mother.</s> <s sid="9" id="cran.c13.s9">The post was not half of so much consequence to dear Miss Matty; but not for the world would she have diminished Thomas's welcome and his dole, though I could see that she felt rather shy over the ceremony, which had been regarded by Miss Jenkyns as a glorious opportunity for giving advice and benefiting her fellow-creatures.</s> <s sid="10" id="cran.c13.s10">Miss Matty would steal the money all in a lump into his hand, as if she were ashamed of herself.</s> <s sid="11" id="cran.c13.s11">Miss Jenkyns gave him each individual coin separate, with a <qs/>"There! that's for yourself; that's for Jenny,"<qe/> etc.</s> <s sid="12" id="cran.c13.s12">Miss Matty would even beckon Martha out of the kitchen while he ate his food:  and once, to my knowledge, winked at its rapid disappearance into a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief.</s> <s sid="13" id="cran.c13.s13">Miss Jenkyns almost scolded him if he did not leave a clean plate, however heaped it might have been, and gave an injunction with every mouthful.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="cran.c13.p8" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="cran.c13.s37">It was a very uncomfortable subject to me, with my half-knowledge; so I thought I would change the conversation, and I asked at what time she thought we had better go and see the fashions.</s> <s sid="38" id="cran.c13.s38"><qs/>"Well, my dear,"<qe/><sss/> she said, <sse/><qs/>"the thing is this:  it is not etiquette to go till after twelve; but then, you see, all Cranford will be there, and one does not like to be too curious about dress and trimmings and caps with all the world looking on.</s> <s sid="39" id="cran.c13.s39">It is never genteel to be over-curious on these occasions.</s> <s sid="40" id="cran.c13.s40">Deborah had the knack of always looking as if the latest fashion was nothing new to her; a manner she had caught from Lady Arley, who did see all the new modes in London, you know.</s> <s sid="41" id="cran.c13.s41">So I thought we would just slip down--for I do want this morning, soon after breakfast half-a-pound of tea--and then we could go up and examine the things at our leisure, and see exactly how my new silk gown must be made; and then, after twelve, we could go with our minds disengaged, and free from thoughts of dress."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="cran.c13.p9"><s sid="42" id="cran.c13.s42">We began to talk of Miss Matty's new silk gown.</s> <s sid="43" id="cran.c13.s43">I discovered that it would be really the first time in her life that she had had to choose anything of consequence for herself:  for Miss Jenkyns had always been the more decided character, whatever her taste might have been; and it is astonishing how such people carry the world before them by the mere force of will.</s> <s sid="44" id="cran.c13.s44">Miss Matty anticipated the sight of the glossy folds with as much delight as if the five sovereigns, set apart for the purchase, could buy all the silks in the shop; and (remembering my own loss of two hours in a toyshop before I could tell on what wonder to spend a silver threepence) I was very glad that we were going early, that dear Miss Matty might have leisure for the delights of perplexity.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="cran.c13.p10"><s sid="45" id="cran.c13.s45">If a happy sea-green could be met with, the gown was to be sea- green:  if not, she inclined to maize, and I to silver gray; and we discussed the requisite number of breadths until we arrived at the shop-door.</s> <s sid="46" id="cran.c13.s46">We were to buy the tea, select the silk, and then clamber up the iron corkscrew stairs that led into what was once a loft, though now a fashion show-room.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="cran.c13.p11"><s sid="47" id="cran.c13.s47">The young men at Mr Johnson's had on their best looks; and their best cravats, and pivoted themselves over the counter with surprising activity.</s> <s sid="48" id="cran.c13.s48">They wanted to show us upstairs at once; but on the principle of business first and pleasure afterwards, we stayed to purchase the tea.</s> <s sid="49" id="cran.c13.s49">Here Miss Matty's absence of mind betrayed itself.</s> <s sid="50" id="cran.c13.s50">If she was made aware that she had been drinking green tea at any time, she always thought it her duty to lie awake half through the night afterward (I have known her take it in ignorance many a time without such effects), and consequently green tea was prohibited the house; yet to-day she herself asked for the obnoxious article, under the impression that she was talking about the silk.</s> <s sid="51" id="cran.c13.s51">However, the mistake was soon rectified; and then the silks were unrolled in good truth.</s> <s sid="52" id="cran.c13.s52">By this time the shop was pretty well filled, for it was Cranford market-day, and many of the farmers and country people from the neighbourhood round came in, sleeking down their hair, and glancing shyly about, from under their eyelids, as anxious to take back some notion of the unusual gaiety to the mistress or the lasses at home, and yet feeling that they were out of place among the smart shopmen and gay shawls and summer prints.</s> <s sid="53" id="cran.c13.s53">One honest-looking man, however, made his way up to the counter at which we stood, and boldly asked to look at a shawl or two.</s> <s sid="54" id="cran.c13.s54">The other country folk confined themselves to the grocery side; but our neighbour was evidently too full of some kind intention towards mistress, wife or daughter, to be shy; and it soon became a question with me, whether he or Miss Matty would keep their shopmen the longest time.</s> <s sid="55" id="cran.c13.s55">He thought each shawl more beautiful than the last; and, as for Miss Matty, she smiled and sighed over each fresh bale that was brought out; one colour set off another, and the heap together would, as she said, make even the rainbow look poor.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="cran.c13.p12" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="cran.c13.s56"><qs/>"I am afraid,"<qe/><sss/> said she, hesitating, <sse/><qs/>"Whichever I choose I shall wish I had taken another.</s> <s sid="57" id="cran.c13.s57">Look at this lovely crimson! it would be so warm in winter.</s> <s sid="58" id="cran.c13.s58">But spring is coming on, you know.</s> <s sid="59" id="cran.c13.s59">I wish I could have a gown for every season,"<qe/> said she, dropping her voice-- as we all did in Cranford whenever we talked of anything we wished for but could not afford.</s> <s sid="60" id="cran.c13.s60"><qs/>"However,"<qe/><sls/> she continued in a louder and more cheerful tone, <sle/><qs/>"it would give me a great deal of trouble to take care of them if I had them; so, I think, I'll only take one.</s> <s sid="61" id="cran.c13.s61">But which must it be, my dear?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="cran.c14.p56"><s sid="191" id="cran.c14.s191">Old hoards were taken out and examined as to their money value which luckily was small, or else I don't know how Miss Matty would have prevailed upon herself to part with such things as her mother's wedding-ring, the strange, uncouth brooch with which her father had disfigured his shirt-frill, &amp;c.</s> <s sid="192" id="cran.c14.s192">However, we arranged things a little in order as to their pecuniary estimation, and were all ready for my father when he came the next morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="cran.c15.p2"><s sid="6" id="cran.c15.s6">But what was our surprise--our dismay--when we learnt that Mr and MRS HOGGINS were returning on the following Tuesday!</s> <s sid="7" id="cran.c15.s7">Mrs Hoggins!</s> <s sid="8" id="cran.c15.s8">Had she absolutely dropped her title, and so, in a spirit of bravado, cut the aristocracy to become a Hoggins!</s> <s sid="9" id="cran.c15.s9">She, who might have been called Lady Glenmire to her dying day!</s> <s sid="10" id="cran.c15.s10">Mrs Jamieson was pleased.</s> <s sid="11" id="cran.c15.s11">She said it only convinced her of what she had known from the first, that the creature had a low taste.</s> <s sid="12" id="cran.c15.s12">But "the creature" looked very happy on Sunday at church; nor did we see it necessary to keep our veils down on that side of our bonnets on which Mr and Mrs Hoggins sat, as Mrs Jamieson did; thereby missing all the smiling glory of his face, and all the becoming blushes of hers.</s> <s sid="13" id="cran.c15.s13">I am not sure if Martha and Jem looked more radiant in the afternoon, when they, too, made their first appearance.</s> <s sid="14" id="cran.c15.s14">Mrs Jamieson soothed the turbulence of her soul by having the blinds of her windows drawn down, as if for a funeral, on the day when Mr and Mrs Hoggins received callers; and it was with some difficulty that she was prevailed upon to continue the St James's Chronicle, so indignant was she with its having inserted the announcement of the marriage.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="cran.c15.p3"><s sid="15" id="cran.c15.s15">Miss Matty's sale went off famously.</s> <s sid="16" id="cran.c15.s16">She retained the furniture of her sitting-room and bedroom; the former of which she was to occupy till Martha could meet with a lodger who might wish to take it; and into this sitting-room and bedroom she had to cram all sorts of things, which were (the auctioneer assured her) bought in for her at the sale by an unknown friend.</s> <s sid="17" id="cran.c15.s17">I always suspected Mrs Fitz-Adam of this; but she must have had an accessory, who knew what articles were particularly regarded by Miss Matty on account of their associations with her early days.</s> <s sid="18" id="cran.c15.s18">The rest of the house looked rather bare, to be sure; all except one tiny bedroom, of which my father allowed me to purchase the furniture for my occasional use in case of Miss Matty's illness.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="cran.c15.p4" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="cran.c15.s19">I had expended my own small store in buying all manner of comfits and lozenges, in order to tempt the little people whom Miss Matty loved so much to come about her.</s> <s sid="20" id="cran.c15.s20">Tea in bright green canisters, and comfits in tumblers--Miss Matty and I felt quite proud as we looked round us on the evening before the shop was to be opened.</s> <s sid="21" id="cran.c15.s21">Martha had scoured the boarded floor to a white cleanness, and it was adorned with a brilliant piece of oil-cloth, on which customers were to stand before the table-counter.</s> <s sid="22" id="cran.c15.s22">The wholesome smell of plaster and whitewash pervaded the apartment.</s> <s sid="23" id="cran.c15.s23">A very small <qs/>"Matilda Jenkyns, licensed to sell tea,"<qe/> was hidden under the lintel of the new door, and two boxes of tea, with cabalistic inscriptions all over them, stood ready to disgorge their contents into the canisters.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="cran.c15.p30" type="speech"><s sid="150" id="cran.c15.s150">I don't believe Mr Peter came home from India as rich as a nabob; he even considered himself poor, but neither he nor Miss Matty cared much about that.</s> <s sid="151" id="cran.c15.s151">At any rate, he had enough to live upon "very genteelly" at Cranford; he and Miss Matty together.</s> <s sid="152" id="cran.c15.s152">And a day or two after his arrival, the shop was closed, while troops of little urchins gleefully awaited the shower of comfits and lozenges that came from time to time down upon their faces as they stood up- gazing at Miss Matty's drawing-room windows.</s> <s sid="153" id="cran.c15.s153">Occasionally Miss Matty would say to them (half-hidden behind the curtains), <qs/>"My dear children, don't make yourselves ill;"<qe/> but a strong arm pulled her back, and a more rattling shower than ever succeeded.</s> <s sid="154" id="cran.c15.s154">A part of the tea was sent in presents to the Cranford ladies; and some of it was distributed among the old people who remembered Mr Peter in the days of his frolicsome youth.</s> <s sid="155" id="cran.c15.s155">The Indian muslin gown was reserved for darling Flora Gordon (Miss Jessie Brown's daughter).</s> <s sid="156" id="cran.c15.s156">The Gordons had been on the Continent for the last few years, but were now expected to return very soon; and Miss Matty, in her sisterly pride, anticipated great delight in the joy of showing them Mr Peter.</s> <s sid="157" id="cran.c15.s157">The pearl necklace disappeared; and about that time many handsome and useful presents made their appearance in the households of Miss Pole and Mrs Forrester; and some rare and delicate Indian ornaments graced the drawing-rooms of Mrs Jamieson and Mrs Fitz-Adam.</s> <s sid="158" id="cran.c15.s158">I myself was not forgotten.</s> <s sid="159" id="cran.c15.s159">Among other things, I had the handsomest-bound and best edition of Dr Johnson's works that could be procured; and dear Miss Matty, with tears in her eyes, begged me to consider it as a present from her sister as well as herself.</s> <s sid="160" id="cran.c15.s160">In short, no one was forgotten; and, what was more, every one, however insignificant, who had shown kindness to Miss Matty at any time, was sure of Mr Peter's cordial regard.</s> </p></div>

<title>CHAPTER XVI--PEACE TO CRANFORD</title>

<p pid="1" id="cran.c16.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="cran.c16.s1">It was not surprising that Mr Peter became such a favourite at Cranford.</s> <s sid="2" id="cran.c16.s2">The ladies vied with each other who should admire him most; and no wonder, for their quiet lives were astonishingly stirred up by the arrival from India--especially as the person arrived told more wonderful stories than Sindbad the Sailor; and, as Miss Pole said, was quite as good as an Arabian Night any evening.</s> <s sid="3" id="cran.c16.s3">For my own part, I had vibrated all my life between Drumble and Cranford, and I thought it was quite possible that all Mr Peter's stories might be true, although wonderful; but when I found that, if we swallowed an anecdote of tolerable magnitude one week, we had the dose considerably increased the next, I began to have my doubts; especially as I noticed that when his sister was present the accounts of Indian life were comparatively tame; not that she knew more than we did, perhaps less.</s> <s sid="4" id="cran.c16.s4">I noticed also that when the rector came to call, Mr Peter talked in a different way about the countries he had been in.</s> <s sid="5" id="cran.c16.s5">But I don't think the ladies in Cranford would have considered him such a wonderful traveller if they had only heard him talk in the quiet way he did to him.</s> <s sid="6" id="cran.c16.s6">They liked him the better, indeed, for being what they called <qs/>"so very Oriental."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="cran.c16.p2" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="cran.c16.s7">One day, at a select party in his honour, which Miss Pole gave, and from which, as Mrs Jamieson honoured it with her presence, and had even offered to send Mr Mulliner to wait, Mr and Mrs Hoggins and Mrs Fitz-Adam were necessarily--excluded one day at Miss Pole's, Mr Peter said he was tired of sitting upright against the hard-backed uneasy chairs, and asked if he might not indulge himself in sitting cross-legged.</s> <s sid="8" id="cran.c16.s8">Miss Pole's consent was eagerly given, and down he went with the utmost gravity.</s> <s sid="9" id="cran.c16.s9">But when Miss Pole asked me, in an audible whisper, <qs/>"if he did not remind me of the Father of the Faithful?"<qe/></s> <s sid="10" id="cran.c16.s10">I could not help thinking of poor Simon Jones, the lame tailor, and while Mrs Jamieson slowly commented on the elegance and convenience of the attitude, I remembered how we had all followed that lady's lead in condemning Mr Hoggins for vulgarity because he simply crossed his legs as he sat still on his chair.</s> <s sid="11" id="cran.c16.s11">Many of Mr Peter's ways of eating were a little strange amongst such ladies as Miss Pole, and Miss Matty, and Mrs Jamieson, especially when I recollected the untasted green peas and two-pronged forks at poor Mr Holbrook's dinner.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="cran.c16.p3"><s sid="12" id="cran.c16.s12">The mention of that gentleman's name recalls to my mind a conversation between Mr Peter and Miss Matty one evening in the summer after he returned to Cranford.</s> <s sid="13" id="cran.c16.s13">The day had been very hot, and Miss Matty had been much oppressed by the weather, in the heat of which her brother revelled.</s> <s sid="14" id="cran.c16.s14">I remember that she had been unable to nurse Martha's baby, which had become her favourite employment of late, and which was as much at home in her arms as in its mother's, as long as it remained a light-weight, portable by one so fragile as Miss Matty.</s> <s sid="15" id="cran.c16.s15">This day to which I refer, Miss Matty had seemed more than usually feeble and languid, and only revived when the sun went down, and her sofa was wheeled to the open window, through which, although it looked into the principal street of Cranford, the fragrant smell of the neighbouring hayfields came in every now and then, borne by the soft breezes that stirred the dull air of the summer twilight, and then died away.</s> <s sid="16" id="cran.c16.s16">The silence of the sultry atmosphere was lost in the murmuring noises which came in from many an open window and door; even the children were abroad in the street, late as it was (between ten and eleven), enjoying the game of play for which they had not had spirits during the heat of the day.</s> <s sid="17" id="cran.c16.s17">It was a source of satisfaction to Miss Matty to see how few candles were lighted, even in the apartments of those houses from which issued the greatest signs of life.</s> <s sid="18" id="cran.c16.s18">Mr Peter, Miss Matty, and I had all been quiet, each with a separate reverie, for some little time, when Mr Peter broke in -</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="cran.c16.p4" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="cran.c16.s19"><qs/>"Do you know, little Matty, I could have sworn you were on the high road to matrimony when I left England that last time!</s> <s sid="20" id="cran.c16.s20">If anybody had told me you would have lived and died an old maid then, I should have laughed in their faces."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="cran.c16.p5"><s sid="21" id="cran.c16.s21">Miss Matty made no reply, and I tried in vain to think of some subject which should effectually turn the conversation; but I was very stupid; and before I spoke he went on -</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="cran.c16.p7"><s sid="33" id="cran.c16.s33">I did so, and then stooped down to kiss Miss Matty, and see if she really were chilled.</s> <s sid="34" id="cran.c16.s34">She caught at my hand, and gave it a hard squeeze--but unconsciously, I think--for in a minute or two she spoke to us quite in her usual voice, and smiled our uneasiness away, although she patiently submitted to the prescriptions we enforced of a warm bed and a glass of weak negus.</s> <s sid="35" id="cran.c16.s35">I was to leave Cranford the next day, and before I went I saw that all the effects of the open window had quite vanished.</s> <s sid="36" id="cran.c16.s36">I had superintended most of the alterations necessary in the house and household during the latter weeks of my stay.</s> <s sid="37" id="cran.c16.s37">The shop was once more a parlour:  the empty resounding rooms again furnished up to the very garrets.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="cran.c16.p8"><s sid="38" id="cran.c16.s38">There had been some talk of establishing Martha and Jem in another house, but Miss Matty would not hear of this.</s> <s sid="39" id="cran.c16.s39">Indeed, I never saw her so much roused as when Miss Pole had assumed it to be the most desirable arrangement.</s> <s sid="40" id="cran.c16.s40">As long as Martha would remain with Miss Matty, Miss Matty was only too thankful to have her about her; yes, and Jem too, who was a very pleasant man to have in the house, for she never saw him from week's end to week's end.</s> <s sid="41" id="cran.c16.s41">And as for the probable children, if they would all turn out such little darlings as her god-daughter, Matilda, she should not mind the number, if Martha didn't.</s> <s sid="42" id="cran.c16.s42">Besides, the next was to be called Deborah--a point which Miss Matty had reluctantly yielded to Martha's stubborn determination that her first-born was to be Matilda.</s> <s sid="43" id="cran.c16.s43">So Miss Pole had to lower her colours, and even her voice, as she said to me that, as Mr and Mrs Hearn were still to go on living in the same house with Miss Matty, we had certainly done a wise thing in hiring Martha's niece as an auxiliary.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="cran.c16.p9"><s sid="44" id="cran.c16.s44">I left Miss Matty and Mr Peter most comfortable and contented; the only subject for regret to the tender heart of the one, and the social friendly nature of the other, being the unfortunate quarrel between Mrs Jamieson and the plebeian Hogginses and their following.</s> <s sid="45" id="cran.c16.s45">In joke, I prophesied one day that this would only last until Mrs Jamieson or Mr Mulliner were ill, in which case they would only be too glad to be friends with Mr Hoggins; but Miss Matty did not like my looking forward to anything like illness in so light a manner, and before the year was out all had come round in a far more satisfactory way.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="cran.c16.p10" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="cran.c16.s46">I received two Cranford letters on one auspicious October morning.</s> <s sid="47" id="cran.c16.s47">Both Miss Pole and Miss Matty wrote to ask me to come over and meet the Gordons, who had returned to England alive and well with their two children, now almost grown up.</s> <s sid="48" id="cran.c16.s48">Dear Jessie Brown had kept her old kind nature, although she had changed her name and station; and she wrote to say that she and Major Gordon expected to be in Cranford on the fourteenth, and she hoped and begged to be remembered to Mrs Jamieson (named first, as became her honourable station), Miss Pole and Miss Matty--could she ever forget their kindness to her poor father and sister?--Mrs Forrester, Mr Hoggins (and here again came in an allusion to kindness shown to the dead long ago), his new wife, who as such must allow Mrs Gordon to desire to make her acquaintance, and who was, moreover, an old Scotch friend of her husband's.</s> <s sid="49" id="cran.c16.s49">In short, every one was named, from the rector--who had been appointed to Cranford in the interim between Captain Brown's death and Miss Jessie's marriage, and was now associated with the latter event--down to Miss Betty Barker.</s> <s sid="50" id="cran.c16.s50">All were asked to the luncheon; all except Mrs Fitz-Adam, who had come to live in Cranford since Miss Jessie Brown's days, and whom I found rather moping on account of the omission.</s> <s sid="51" id="cran.c16.s51">People wondered at Miss Betty Barker's being included in the honourable list; but, then, as Miss Pole said, we must remember the disregard of the genteel proprieties of life in which the poor captain had educated his girls, and for his sake we swallowed our pride.</s> <s sid="52" id="cran.c16.s52">Indeed, Mrs Jamieson rather took it as a compliment, as putting Miss Betty (formerly HER maid) on a level with <qs/>"those Hogginses."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="cran.c16.p11" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="cran.c16.s53">But when I arrived in Cranford, nothing was as yet ascertained of Mrs Jamieson's own intentions; would the honourable lady go, or would she not?</s> <s sid="54" id="cran.c16.s54">Mr Peter declared that she should and she would; Miss Pole shook her head and desponded.</s> <s sid="55" id="cran.c16.s55">But Mr Peter was a man of resources.</s> <s sid="56" id="cran.c16.s56">In the first place, he persuaded Miss Matty to write to Mrs Gordon, and to tell her of Mrs Fitz-Adam's existence, and to beg that one so kind, and cordial, and generous, might be included in the pleasant invitation.</s> <s sid="57" id="cran.c16.s57">An answer came back by return of post, with a pretty little note for Mrs Fitz-Adam, and a request that Miss Matty would deliver it herself and explain the previous omission.</s> <s sid="58" id="cran.c16.s58">Mrs Fitz-Adam was as pleased as could be, and thanked Miss Matty over and over again.</s> <s sid="59" id="cran.c16.s59">Mr Peter had said, <qs/>"Leave Mrs Jamieson to me;"<qe/> so we did; especially as we knew nothing that we could do to alter her determination if once formed.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="cran.c16.p12" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="cran.c16.s60">I did not know, nor did Miss Matty, how things were going on, until Miss Pole asked me, just the day before Mrs Gordon came, if I thought there was anything between Mr Peter and Mrs Jamieson in the matrimonial line, for that Mrs Jamieson was really going to the lunch at the <qs/>"George."<qe/></s> <s sid="61" id="cran.c16.s61">She had sent Mr Mulliner down to desire that there might be a footstool put to the warmest seat in the room, as she meant to come, and knew that their chairs were very high.</s> <s sid="62" id="cran.c16.s62">Miss Pole had picked this piece of news up, and from it she conjectured all sorts of things, and bemoaned yet more.</s> <s sid="63" id="cran.c16.s63"><qs/>"If Peter should marry, what would become of poor dear Miss Matty?</s> <s sid="64" id="cran.c16.s64">And Mrs Jamieson, of all people!"<qe/></s> <s sid="65" id="cran.c16.s65">Miss Pole seemed to think there were other ladies in Cranford who would have done more credit to his choice, and I think she must have had someone who was unmarried in her head, for she kept saying, <qs/>"It was so wanting in delicacy in a widow to think of such a thing."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="cran.c16.p13" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="cran.c16.s66">When I got back to Miss Matty's I really did begin to think that Mr Peter might be thinking of Mrs Jamieson for a wife, and I was as unhappy as Miss Pole about it.</s> <s sid="67" id="cran.c16.s67">He had the proof sheet of a great placard in his hand.</s> <s sid="68" id="cran.c16.s68"><qs/>"Signor Brunoni, Magician to the King of Delhi, the Rajah of Oude, and the great Lama of Thibet,"<qe/> &amp;c.</s> <s sid="69" id="cran.c16.s69">&amp;c., was going to <qs/>"perform in Cranford for one night only,"<qe/> the very next night; and Miss Matty, exultant, showed me a letter from the Gordons, promising to remain over this gaiety, which Miss Matty said was entirely Peter's doing.</s> <s sid="70" id="cran.c16.s70">He had written to ask the signor to come, and was to be at all the expenses of the affair.</s> <s sid="71" id="cran.c16.s71">Tickets were to be sent gratis to as many as the room would hold.</s> <s sid="72" id="cran.c16.s72">In short, Miss Matty was charmed with the plan, and said that to- morrow Cranford would remind her of the Preston Guild, to which she had been in her youth--a luncheon at the <qs/>"George,"<qe/> with the dear Gordons, and the signor in the Assembly Room in the evening.</s> <s sid="73" id="cran.c16.s73">But I--I looked only at the fatal words:-</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="cran.c16.p16" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="cran.c16.s77">So, angry and irritated, and exaggerating every little incident which could add to my irritation, I went on till we were all assembled in the great parlour at the <qs/>"George."<qe/></s> <s sid="78" id="cran.c16.s78">Major and Mrs Gordon and pretty Flora and Mr Ludovic were all as bright and handsome and friendly as could be; but I could hardly attend to them for watching Mr Peter, and I saw that Miss Pole was equally busy.</s> <s sid="79" id="cran.c16.s79">I had never seen Mrs Jamieson so roused and animated before; her face looked full of interest in what Mr Peter was saying.</s> <s sid="80" id="cran.c16.s80">I drew near to listen.</s> <s sid="81" id="cran.c16.s81">My relief was great when I caught that his words were not words of love, but that, for all his grave face, he was at his old tricks.</s> <s sid="82" id="cran.c16.s82">He was telling her of his travels in India, and describing the wonderful height of the Himalaya mountains:  one touch after another added to their size, and each exceeded the former in absurdity; but Mrs Jamieson really enjoyed all in perfect good faith.</s> <s sid="83" id="cran.c16.s83">I suppose she required strong stimulants to excite her to come out of her apathy.</s> <s sid="84" id="cran.c16.s84">Mr Peter wound up his account by saying that, of course, at that altitude there were none of the animals to be found that existed in the lower regions; the game,--everything was different.</s> <s sid="85" id="cran.c16.s85">Firing one day at some flying creature, he was very much dismayed when it fell, to find that he had shot a cherubim!</s> <s sid="86" id="cran.c16.s86">Mr Peter caught my eye at this moment, and gave me such a funny twinkle, that I felt sure he had no thoughts of Mrs Jamieson as a wife from that time.</s> <s sid="87" id="cran.c16.s87">She looked uncomfortably amazed -</s> </p>
