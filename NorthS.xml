On its appearance in 'Household Words,' this tale was obliged to

conform to the conditions imposed by the requirements of a weekly

publication, and likewise to confine itself within certain

advertised limits, in order that faith might be kept with the

public. Although these conditions were made as light as they well

could be, the author found it impossible to develope the story in

the manner originally intended, and, more especially, was

compelled to hurry on events with an improbable rapidity towards

the close. In some degree to remedy this obvious defect, various

short passages have been inserted, and several new chapters

added. With this brief explanation, the tale is commended to the

kindness of the reader;



'Beseking hym lowly, of mercy and pite, Of its rude makyng to

have compassion.'</stru>

<title>CHAPTER I 'HASTE TO THE WEDDING' 'Wooed and married and a'.'</title>

<p pid="1" id="NorthS.c1.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="NorthS.c1.s1"><qs/>'Edith!'<qe/><sss/> said Margaret, gently, <sse/><qs/>'Edith!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NorthS.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="NorthS.c1.s2">But, as Margaret half suspected, Edith had fallen asleep.</s> <s sid="3" id="NorthS.c1.s3">She lay curled up on the sofa in the back drawing-room in Harley Street, looking very lovely in her white muslin and blue ribbons.</s> <s sid="4" id="NorthS.c1.s4">If Titania had ever been dressed in white muslin and blue ribbons, and had fallen asleep on a crimson damask sofa in a back drawing-room, Edith might have been taken for her.</s> <s sid="5" id="NorthS.c1.s5">Margaret was struck afresh by her cousin s beauty.</s> <s sid="6" id="NorthS.c1.s6">They had grown up together from childhood, and all along Edith had been remarked upon by every one, except Margaret, for her prettiness; but Margaret had never thought about it until the last few days, when the prospect of soon losing her companion seemed to give force to every sweet quality and charm which Edith possessed.</s> <s sid="7" id="NorthS.c1.s7">They had been talking about wedding dresses, and wedding ceremonies; and Captain Lennox, and what he had told Edith about her future life at Corfu, where his regiment was stationed; and the difficulty of keeping a piano in good tune (a difficulty which Edith seemed to consider as one of the most formidable that could befall her in her married life), and what gowns she should want in the visits to Scotland, which would immediately succeed her marriage; but the whispered tone had latterly become more drowsy; and Margaret, after a pause of a few minutes, found, as she fancied, that in spite of the buzz in the next room, Edith had rolled herself up into a soft ball of muslin and ribbon, and silken curls, and gone off into a peaceful little after-dinner nap.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="NorthS.c1.p3"><s sid="8" id="NorthS.c1.s8">Margaret had been on the point of telling her cousin of some of the plans and visions which she entertained as to her future life in the country parsonage, where her father and mother lived; and where her bright holidays had always been passed, though for the last ten years her aunt Shaw's house had been considered as her home.</s> <s sid="9" id="NorthS.c1.s9">But in default of a listener, she had to brood over the change in her life silently as heretofore.</s> <s sid="10" id="NorthS.c1.s10">It was a happy brooding, although tinged with regret at being separated for an indefinite time from her gentle aunt and dear cousin.</s> <s sid="11" id="NorthS.c1.s11">As she thought of the delight of filling the important post of only daughter in Helstone parsonage, pieces of the conversation out of the next room came upon her ears.</s> <s sid="12" id="NorthS.c1.s12">Her aunt Shaw was talking to the five or six ladies who had been dining there, and whose husbands were still in the dining-room.</s> <s sid="13" id="NorthS.c1.s13">They were the familiar acquaintances of the house; neighbours whom Mrs. Shaw called friends, because she happened to dine with them more frequently than with any other people, and because if she or Edith wanted anything from them, or they from her, they did not scruple to make a call at each other's houses before luncheon.</s> <s sid="14" id="NorthS.c1.s14">These ladies and their husbands were invited, in their capacity of friends, to eat a farewell dinner in honour of Edith's approaching marriage.</s> <s sid="15" id="NorthS.c1.s15">Edith had rather objected to this arrangement, for Captain Lennox was expected to arrive by a late train this very evening; but, although she was a spoiled child, she was too careless and idle to have a very strong will of her own, and gave way when she found that her mother had absolutely ordered those extra delicacies of the season which are always supposed to be efficacious against immoderate grief at farewell dinners.</s> <s sid="16" id="NorthS.c1.s16">She contented herself by leaning back in her chair, merely playing with the food on her plate, and looking grave and absent; while all around her were enjoying the mots of Mr. Grey, the gentleman who always took the bottom of the table at Mrs. Shaw's dinner parties, and asked Edith to give them some music in the drawing-room.</s> <s sid="17" id="NorthS.c1.s17">Mr. Grey was particularly agreeable over this farewell dinner, and the gentlemen staid down stairs longer than usual.</s> <s sid="18" id="NorthS.c1.s18">It was very well they did--to judge from the fragments of conversation which Margaret overheard.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="NorthS.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="NorthS.c1.s19"><qs/>'I suffered too much myself; not that I was not extremely happy with the poor dear General, but still disparity of age is a drawback; one that I was resolved Edith should not have to encounter.</s> <s sid="20" id="NorthS.c1.s20">Of course, without any maternal partiality, I foresaw that the dear child was likely to marry early; indeed, I had often said that I was sure she would be married before she was nineteen.</s> <s sid="21" id="NorthS.c1.s21">I had quite a prophetic feeling when Captain Lennox'<qe/>--and here the voice dropped into a whisper, but Margaret could easily supply the blank.</s> <s sid="22" id="NorthS.c1.s22">The course of true love in Edith's case had run remarkably smooth.</s> <s sid="23" id="NorthS.c1.s23">Mrs. Shaw had given way to the presentiment, as she expressed it; and had rather urged on the marriage, although it was below the expectations which many of Edith's acquaintances had formed for her, a young and pretty heiress.</s> <s sid="24" id="NorthS.c1.s24">But Mrs. Shaw said that her only child should marry for love,--and sighed emphatically, as if love had not been her motive for marrying the General.</s> <s sid="25" id="NorthS.c1.s25">Mrs. Shaw enjoyed the romance of the present engagement rather more than her daughter.</s> <s sid="26" id="NorthS.c1.s26">Not but that Edith was very thoroughly and properly in love; still she would certainly have preferred a good house in Belgravia, to all the picturesqueness of the life which Captain Lennox described at Corfu.</s> <s sid="27" id="NorthS.c1.s27">The very parts which made Margaret glow as she listened, Edith pretended to shiver and shudder at; partly for the pleasure she had in being coaxed out of her dislike by her fond lover, and partly because anything of a gipsy or make-shift life was really distasteful to her.</s> <s sid="28" id="NorthS.c1.s28">Yet had any one come with a fine house, and a fine estate, and a fine title to boot, Edith would still have clung to Captain Lennox while the temptation lasted; when it was over, it is possible she might have had little qualms of ill-concealed regret that Captain Lennox could not have united in his person everything that was desirable.</s> <s sid="29" id="NorthS.c1.s29">In this she was but her mother's child; who, after deliberately marrying General Shaw with no warmer feeling than respect for his character and establishment, was constantly, though quietly, bemoaning her hard lot in being united to one whom she could not love.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="NorthS.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="NorthS.c1.s30"><qs/>'I have spared no expense in her trousseau,'<qe/> were the next words Margaret heard.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="NorthS.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="NorthS.c1.s31"><qs/>'She has all the beautiful Indian shawls and scarfs the General gave to me, but which I shall never wear again.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="NorthS.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="NorthS.c1.s32"><qs/>'She is a lucky girl,'<qe/> replied another voice, which Margaret knew to be that of Mrs. Gibson, a lady who was taking a double interest in the conversation, from the fact of one of her daughters having been married within the last few weeks.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="NorthS.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="NorthS.c1.s33"><qs/>'Helen had set her heart upon an Indian shawl, but really when I found what an extravagant price was asked, I was obliged to refuse her.</s> <s sid="34" id="NorthS.c1.s34">She will be quite envious when she hears of Edith having Indian shawls.</s> <s sid="35" id="NorthS.c1.s35">What kind are they?</s> <s sid="36" id="NorthS.c1.s36">Delhi? with the lovely little borders?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="NorthS.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="NorthS.c1.s37">Margaret heard her aunt's voice again, but this time it was as if she had raised herself up from her half-recumbent position, and were looking into the more dimly lighted back drawing-room.</s> <s sid="38" id="NorthS.c1.s38"><qs/>'Edith!</s> <s sid="39" id="NorthS.c1.s39">Edith!'<qe/> cried she; and then she sank as if wearied by the exertion.</s> <s sid="40" id="NorthS.c1.s40">Margaret stepped forward.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="NorthS.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="NorthS.c1.s41"><qs/>'Edith is asleep, Aunt Shaw.</s> <s sid="42" id="NorthS.c1.s42">Is it anything I can do?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="NorthS.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="NorthS.c1.s43">All the ladies said <qs/>'Poor child!'<qe/> on receiving this distressing intelligence about Edith; and the minute lap-dog in Mrs. Shaw's arms began to bark, as if excited by the burst of pity.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="NorthS.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="NorthS.c1.s44"><qs/>'Hush, Tiny! you naughty little girl! you will waken your mistress.</s> <s sid="45" id="NorthS.c1.s45">It was only to ask Edith if she would tell Newton to bring down her shawls: perhaps you would go, Margaret dear?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="NorthS.c1.p13"><s sid="46" id="NorthS.c1.s46">Margaret went up into the old nursery at the very top of the house, where Newton was busy getting up some laces which were required for the wedding.</s> <s sid="47" id="NorthS.c1.s47">While Newton went (not without a muttered grumbling) to undo the shawls, which had already been exhibited four or five times that day, Margaret looked round upon the nursery; the first room in that house with which she had become familiar nine years ago, when she was brought, all untamed from the forest, to share the home, the play, and the lessons of her cousin Edith.</s> <s sid="48" id="NorthS.c1.s48">She remembered the dark, dim look of the London nursery, presided over by an austere and ceremonious nurse, who was terribly particular about clean hands and torn frocks.</s> <s sid="49" id="NorthS.c1.s49">She recollected the first tea up there--separate from her father and aunt, who were dining somewhere down below an infinite depth of stairs; for unless she were up in the sky (the child thought), they must be deep down in the bowels of the earth.</s> <s sid="50" id="NorthS.c1.s50">At home--before she came to live in Harley Street--her mother's dressing-room had been her nursery; and, as they kept early hours in the country parsonage, Margaret had always had her meals with her father and mother.</s> <s sid="51" id="NorthS.c1.s51">Oh! well did the tall stately girl of eighteen remember the tears shed with such wild passion of grief by the little girl of nine, as she hid her face under the bed-clothes, in that first night; and how she was bidden not to cry by the nurse, because it would disturb Miss Edith; and how she had cried as bitterly, but more quietly, till her newly-seen, grand, pretty aunt had come softly upstairs with Mr. Hale to show him his little sleeping daughter.</s> <s sid="52" id="NorthS.c1.s52">Then the little Margaret had hushed her sobs, and tried to lie quiet as if asleep, for fear of making her father unhappy by her grief, which she dared not express before her aunt, and which she rather thought it was wrong to feel at all after the long hoping, and planning, and contriving they had gone through at home, before her wardrobe could be arranged so as to suit her. grander circumstances, and before papa could leave his parish to come up to London, even for a few days.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="NorthS.c1.p14"><s sid="53" id="NorthS.c1.s53">Now she had got to love the old nursery, though it was but a dismantled place; and she looked all round, with a kind of cat-like regret, at the idea of leaving it for ever in three days.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="NorthS.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="NorthS.c1.s54"><qs/>'Ah Newton!'<qe/><sss/> said she, <sse/><qs/>'I think we shall all be sorry to leave this dear old room.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="NorthS.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="NorthS.c1.s55"><qs/>'Indeed, miss, I shan't for one.</s> <s sid="56" id="NorthS.c1.s56">My eyes are not so good as they were, and the light here is so bad that I can't see to mend laces except just at the window, where there's always a shocking draught--enough to give one one's death of cold.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="NorthS.c1.p17"><s sid="57" id="NorthS.c1.s57">Well, I dare say you will have both good light and plenty of warmth at Naples.</s> <s sid="58" id="NorthS.c1.s58">You must keep as much of your darning as you can till then.</s> <s sid="59" id="NorthS.c1.s59">Thank you, Newton, I can take them down--you're busy.'</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="NorthS.c1.p18"><s sid="60" id="NorthS.c1.s60">So Margaret went down laden with shawls, and snuffing up their spicy Eastern smell.</s> <s sid="61" id="NorthS.c1.s61">Her aunt asked her to stand as a sort of lay figure on which to display them, as Edith was still asleep.</s> <s sid="62" id="NorthS.c1.s62">No one thought about it; but Margaret's tall, finely made figure, in the black silk dress which she was wearing as mourning for some distant relative of her father's, set off the long beautiful folds of the gorgeous shawls that would have half-smothered Edith.</s> <s sid="63" id="NorthS.c1.s63">Margaret stood right under the chandelier, quite silent and passive, while her aunt adjusted the draperies.</s> <s sid="64" id="NorthS.c1.s64">Occasionally, as she was turned round, she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror over the chimney-piece, and smiled at her own appearance there-the familiar features in the usual garb of a princess.</s> <s sid="65" id="NorthS.c1.s65">She touched the shawls gently as they hung around her, and took a pleasure in their soft feel and their brilliant colours, and rather liked to be dressed in such splendour--enjoying it much as a child would do, with a quiet pleased smile on her lips.</s> <s sid="66" id="NorthS.c1.s66">Just then the door opened, and Mr. Henry Lennox was suddenly announced.</s> <s sid="67" id="NorthS.c1.s67">Some of the ladies started back, as if half-ashamed of their feminine interest in dress.</s> <s sid="68" id="NorthS.c1.s68">Mrs. Shaw held out her hand to the new-comer; Margaret stood perfectly still, thinking she might be yet wanted as a sort of block for the shawls; but looking at Mr. Lennox with a bright, amused face, as if sure of his sympathy in her sense of the ludicrousness at being thus surprised.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="NorthS.c1.p19"><s sid="69" id="NorthS.c1.s69">Her aunt was so much absorbed in asking Mr. Henry Lennox--who had not been able to come to dinner--all sorts of questions about his brother the bridegroom, his sister the bridesmaid (coming with the Captain from Scotland for the occasion), and various other members of the Lennox family, that Margaret saw she was no more wanted as shawl-bearer, and devoted herself to the amusement of the other visitors, whom her aunt had for the moment forgotten.</s> <s sid="70" id="NorthS.c1.s70">Almost immediately, Edith came in from the back drawing-room, winking and blinking her eyes at the stronger light, shaking back her slightly-ruffled curls, and altogether looking like the Sleeping Beauty just startled from her dreams.</s> <s sid="71" id="NorthS.c1.s71">Even in her slumber she had instinctively felt that a Lennox was worth rousing herself for; and she had a multitude of questions to ask about dear Janet, the future, unseen sister-in-law, for whom she professed so much affection, that if Margaret had not been very proud she might have almost felt jealous of the mushroom rival.</s> <s sid="72" id="NorthS.c1.s72">As Margaret sank rather more into the background on her aunt's joining the conversation, she saw Henry Lennox directing his look towards a vacant seat near her; and she knew perfectly well that as soon as Edith released him from her questioning, he would take possession of that chair.</s> <s sid="73" id="NorthS.c1.s73">She had not been quite sure, from her aunt's rather confused account of his engagements, whether he would come that night; it was almost a surprise to see him; and now she was sure of a pleasant evening.</s> <s sid="74" id="NorthS.c1.s74">He liked and disliked pretty nearly the same things that she did.</s> <s sid="75" id="NorthS.c1.s75">Margaret's face was lightened up into an honest, open brightness.</s> <s sid="76" id="NorthS.c1.s76">By-and-by he came.</s> <s sid="77" id="NorthS.c1.s77">She received him with a smile which had not a tinge of shyness or self-consciousness in it.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="NorthS.c1.p20" type="speech" form="extended" position="beginning"><s sid="78" id="NorthS.c1.s78"><qs/>'Well, I suppose you are all in the depths of business--ladies' business, I mean.</s> <s sid="79" id="NorthS.c1.s79">Very different to my business, which is the real true law business.</s> <s sid="80" id="NorthS.c1.s80">Playing with shawls is very different work to drawing up settlements.</s> </p><p pid="21" id="NorthS.c1.p21" type="speech" form="extended" position="end"><s sid="81" id="NorthS.c1.s81">'Ah, I knew how you would be amused to find us all so occupied in admiring finery.</s> <s sid="82" id="NorthS.c1.s82">But really Indian shawls are very perfect things of their kind.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="22" id="NorthS.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="NorthS.c1.s83"><qs/>'I have no doubt they are.</s> <s sid="84" id="NorthS.c1.s84">Their prices are very perfect, too.</s> <s sid="85" id="NorthS.c1.s85">Nothing wanting.'<qe/></s> <s sid="86" id="NorthS.c1.s86">The gentlemen came dropping in one by one, and the buzz and noise deepened in tone.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="NorthS.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="NorthS.c1.s87"><qs/>'This is your last dinner-party, is it not?</s> <s sid="88" id="NorthS.c1.s88">There are no more before Thursday?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="NorthS.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="NorthS.c1.s89"><qs/>'No. I think after this evening we shall feel at rest, which I am sure I have not done for many weeks; at least, that kind of rest when the hands have nothing more to do, and all the arrangements are complete for an event which must occupy one's head and heart.</s> <s sid="90" id="NorthS.c1.s90">I shall be glad to have time to think, and I am sure Edith will.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="NorthS.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="NorthS.c1.s91"><qs/>'I am not so sure about her; but I can fancy that you will. whenever I have seen you lately, you have been carried away by a whirlwind of some other person's making.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="NorthS.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="NorthS.c1.s92"><qs/>'Yes,'<qe/> said Margaret, rather sadly, remembering the never-ending commotion about trifles that had been going on for more than a month past:</s> <s sid="93" id="NorthS.c1.s93"><qs/>'I wonder if a marriage must always be preceded by what you call a whirlwind, or whether in some cases there might not rather be a calm and peaceful time just before it.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="NorthS.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="NorthS.c1.s94"><qs/>'Cinderella's godmother ordering the trousseau, the wedding-breakfast, writing the notes of invitation, for instance,'<qe/> said Mr. Lennox, laughing.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="NorthS.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="NorthS.c1.s95"><qs/>'But are all these quite necessary troubles?'<qe/> asked Margaret, looking up straight at him for an answer.</s> <s sid="96" id="NorthS.c1.s96">A sense of indescribable weariness of all the arrangements for a pretty effect, in which Edith had been busied as supreme authority for the last six weeks, oppressed her just now; and she really wanted some one to help her to a few pleasant, quiet ideas connected with a marriage.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="NorthS.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="97" id="NorthS.c1.s97"><qs/>'Oh, of course,'<qe/> he replied with a change to gravity in his tone.</s> <s sid="98" id="NorthS.c1.s98"><qs/>'There are forms and ceremonies to be gone through, not so much to satisfy oneself, as to stop the world's mouth, without which stoppage there would be very little satisfaction in life.</s> <s sid="99" id="NorthS.c1.s99">But how would you have a wedding arranged?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="NorthS.c1.p30" type="speech"><s sid="100" id="NorthS.c1.s100"><qs/>'Oh, I have never thought much about it; only I should like it to be a very fine summer morning; and I should like to walk to church through the shade of trees; and not to have so many bridesmaids, and to have no wedding-breakfast.</s> <s sid="101" id="NorthS.c1.s101">I dare say I am resolving against the very things that have given me the most trouble just now.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="NorthS.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="102" id="NorthS.c1.s102"><qs/>'No, I don't think you are.</s> <s sid="103" id="NorthS.c1.s103">The idea of stately simplicity accords well with your character.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="NorthS.c1.p32"><s sid="104" id="NorthS.c1.s104">Margaret did not quite like this speech; she winced away from it more, from remembering former occasions on which he had tried to lead her into a discussion (in which he took the complimentary part) about her own character and ways of going on.</s> <s sid="105" id="NorthS.c1.s105">She cut his speech rather short by saying:</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="NorthS.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="NorthS.c1.s106"><qs/>'It is natural for me to think of Helstone church, and the walk to it, rather than of driving up to a London church in the middle of a paved street.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NorthS.c2.p2" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="NorthS.c2.s4">Margaret was once more in her morning dress, travelling quietly home with her father, who had come up to assist at the wedding.</s> <s sid="5" id="NorthS.c2.s5">Her mother had been detained at home by a multitude of half-reasons, none of which anybody fully understood, except Mr. Hale, who was perfectly aware that all his arguments in favour of a grey satin gown, which was midway between oldness and newness, had proved unavailing; and that, as he had not the money to equip his wife afresh, from top to toe, she would not show herself at her only sister's only child's wedding.</s> <s sid="6" id="NorthS.c2.s6">If Mrs. Shaw had guessed at the real reason why Mrs. Hale did not accompany her husband, she would have showered down gowns upon her; but it was nearly twenty years since Mrs. Shaw had been the poor, pretty Miss Beresford, and she had really forgotten all grievances except that of the unhappiness arising from disparity of age in married life, on which she could descant by the half-hour.</s> <s sid="7" id="NorthS.c2.s7">Dearest Maria had married the man of her heart, only eight years older than herself, with the sweetest temper, and that blue-black hair one so seldom sees.</s> <s sid="8" id="NorthS.c2.s8">Mr. Hale was one of the most delightful preachers she had ever heard, and a perfect model of a parish priest.</s> <s sid="9" id="NorthS.c2.s9">Perhaps it was not quite a logical deduction from all these premises, but it was still Mrs. Shaw's characteristic conclusion, as she thought over her sister's lot:</s> <s sid="10" id="NorthS.c2.s10"><qs/>'Married for love, what can dearest Maria have to wish for in this world?'<qe/></s> <s sid="11" id="NorthS.c2.s11">Mrs. Hale, if she spoke truth, might have answered with a ready-made list, <qs/>'a silver-grey glace silk, a white chip bonnet, oh! dozens of things for the wedding, and hundreds of things for the house.'<qe/></s> <s sid="12" id="NorthS.c2.s12">Margaret only knew that her mother had not found it convenient to come, and she was not sorry to think that their meeting and greeting would take place at Helstone parsonage, rather than, during the confusion of the last two or three days, in the house in Harley Street, where she herself had had to play the part of Figaro, and was wanted everywhere at one and the same time.</s> <s sid="13" id="NorthS.c2.s13">Her mind and body ached now with the recollection of all she had done and said within the last forty-eight hours.</s> <s sid="14" id="NorthS.c2.s14">The farewells so hurriedly taken, amongst all the other good-byes, of those she had lived with so long, oppressed her now with a sad regret for the times that were no more; it did not signify what those times had been, they were gone never to return.</s> <s sid="15" id="NorthS.c2.s15">Margaret's heart felt more heavy than she could ever have thought it possible in going to her own dear home, the place and the life she had longed for for years--at that time of all times for yearning and longing, just before the sharp senses lose their outlines in sleep.</s> <s sid="16" id="NorthS.c2.s16">She took her mind away with a wrench from the recollection of the past to the bright serene contemplation of the hopeful future.</s> <s sid="17" id="NorthS.c2.s17">Her eyes began to see, not visions of what had been, but the sight actually before her; her dear father leaning back asleep in the railway carriage.</s> <s sid="18" id="NorthS.c2.s18">His blue-black hair was grey now, and lay thinly over his brows.</s> <s sid="19" id="NorthS.c2.s19">The bones of his face were plainly to be seen--too plainly for beauty, if his features had been less finely cut; as it was, they had a grace if not a comeliness of their own.</s> <s sid="20" id="NorthS.c2.s20">The face was in repose; but it was rather rest after weariness, than the serene calm of the countenance of one who led a placid, contented life.</s> <s sid="21" id="NorthS.c2.s21">Margaret was painfully struck by the worn, anxious expression; and she went back over the open and avowed circumstances of her father's life, to find the cause for the lines that spoke so plainly of habitual distress and depression.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="NorthS.c2.p5"><s sid="38" id="NorthS.c2.s38">It was the latter part of July when Margaret returned home.</s> <s sid="39" id="NorthS.c2.s39">The forest trees were all one dark, full, dusky green; the fern below them caught all the slanting sunbeams; the weather was sultry and broodingly still.</s> <s sid="40" id="NorthS.c2.s40">Margaret used to tramp along by her father's side, crushing down the fern with a cruel glee, as she felt it yield under her light foot, and send up the fragrance peculiar to it,--out on the broad commons into the warm scented light, seeing multitudes of wild, free, living creatures, revelling in the sunshine, and the herbs and flowers it called forth.</s> <s sid="41" id="NorthS.c2.s41">This life--at least these walks--realised all Margaret's anticipations.</s> <s sid="42" id="NorthS.c2.s42">She took a pride in her forest.</s> <s sid="43" id="NorthS.c2.s43">Its people were her people.</s> <s sid="44" id="NorthS.c2.s44">She made hearty friends with them; learned and delighted in using their peculiar words; took up her freedom amongst them; nursed their babies; talked or read with slow distinctness to their old people; carried dainty messes to their sick; resolved before long to teach at the school, where her father went every day as to an appointed task, but she was continually tempted off to go and see some individual friend--man, woman, or child--in some cottage in the green shade of the forest.</s> <s sid="45" id="NorthS.c2.s45">Her out-of-doors life was perfect.</s> <s sid="46" id="NorthS.c2.s46">Her in-doors life had its drawbacks.</s> <s sid="47" id="NorthS.c2.s47">With the healthy shame of a child, she blamed herself for her keenness of sight, in perceiving that all was not as it should be there.</s> <s sid="48" id="NorthS.c2.s48">Her mother--her mother always so kind and tender towards her--seemed now and then so much discontented with their situation; thought that the bishop strangely neglected his episcopal duties, in not giving Mr. Hale a better living; and almost reproached her husband because he could not bring himself to say that he wished to leave the parish, and undertake the charge of a larger.</s> <s sid="49" id="NorthS.c2.s49">He would sigh aloud as he answered, that if he could do what he ought in little Helstone, he should be thankful; but every day he was more overpowered; the world became more bewildering.</s> <s sid="50" id="NorthS.c2.s50">At each repeated urgency of his wife, that he would put himself in the way of seeking some preferment, Margaret saw that her father shrank more and more; and she strove at such times to reconcile her mother to Helstone.</s> <s sid="51" id="NorthS.c2.s51">Mrs. Hale said that the near neighbourhood of so many trees affected her health; and Margaret would try to tempt her forth on to the beautiful, broad, upland, sun-streaked, cloud-shadowed common; for she was sure that her mother had accustomed herself too much to an in-doors life, seldom extending her walks beyond the church, the school, and the neighbouring cottages.</s> <s sid="52" id="NorthS.c2.s52">This did good for a time; but when the autumn drew on, and the weather became more changeable, her mother's idea of the unhealthiness of the place increased; and she repined even more frequently that her husband, who was more learned than Mr. Hume, a better parish priest than Mr. Houldsworth, should not have met with the preferment that these two former neighbours of theirs had done.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="NorthS.c2.p6"><s sid="53" id="NorthS.c2.s53">This marring of the peace of home, by long hours of discontent, was what Margaret was unprepared for.</s> <s sid="54" id="NorthS.c2.s54">She knew, and had rather revelled in the idea, that she should have to give up many luxuries, which had only been troubles and trammels to her freedom in Harley Street.</s> <s sid="55" id="NorthS.c2.s55">Her keen enjoyment of every sensuous pleasure, was balanced finely, if not overbalanced, by her conscious pride in being able to do without them all, if need were.</s> <s sid="56" id="NorthS.c2.s56">But the cloud never comes in that quarter of the horizon from which we watch for it.</s> <s sid="57" id="NorthS.c2.s57">There had been slight complaints and passing regrets on her mother's part, over some trifle connected with Helstone, and her father's position there, when Margaret had been spending her holidays at home before; but in the general happiness of the recollection of those times, she had forgotten the small details which were not so pleasant.</s> <s sid="58" id="NorthS.c2.s58">In the latter half of September, the autumnal rains and storms came on, and Margaret was obliged to remain more in the house than she had hitherto done.</s> <s sid="59" id="NorthS.c2.s59">Helstone was at some distance from any neighbours of their own standard of cultivation.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="NorthS.c2.p7" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="NorthS.c2.s60"><qs/>'It is undoubtedly one of the most out-of-the-way places in England,'<qe/> said Mrs. Hale, in one of her plaintive moods.</s> <s sid="61" id="NorthS.c2.s61"><qs/>'I can't help regretting constantly that papa has really no one to associate with here; he is so thrown away; seeing no one but farmers and labourers from week's end to week's end.</s> <s sid="62" id="NorthS.c2.s62">If we only lived at the other side of the parish, it would be something; there we should be almost within walking distance of the Stansfields; certainly the Gormans would be within a walk.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="NorthS.c2.p13"><s sid="77" id="NorthS.c2.s77">And walk Margaret did, in spite of the weather.</s> <s sid="78" id="NorthS.c2.s78">She was so happy out of doors, at her father's side, that she almost danced; and with the soft violence of the west wind behind her, as she crossed some heath, she seemed to be borne onwards, as lightly and easily as the fallen leaf that was wafted along by the autumnal breeze.</s> <s sid="79" id="NorthS.c2.s79">But the evenings were rather difficult to fill up agreeably.</s> <s sid="80" id="NorthS.c2.s80">Immediately after tea her father withdrew into his small library, and she and her mother were left alone.</s> <s sid="81" id="NorthS.c2.s81">Mrs. Hale had never cared much for books, and had discouraged her husband, very early in their married life, in his desire of reading aloud to her, while she worked.</s> <s sid="82" id="NorthS.c2.s82">At one time they had tried backgammon as a resource; but as Mr. Hale grew to take an increasing interest in his school and his parishioners, he found that the interruptions which arose out of these duties were regarded as hardships by his wife, not to be accepted as the natural conditions of his profession, but to be regretted and struggled against by her as they severally arose.</s> <s sid="83" id="NorthS.c2.s83">So he withdrew, while the children were yet young, into his library, to spend his evenings (if he were at home), in reading the speculative and metaphysical books which were his delight.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="NorthS.c2.p14" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="NorthS.c2.s84">When Margaret had been here before, she had brought down with her a great box of books, recommended by masters or governess, and had found the summer's day all too short to get through the reading she had to do before her return to town.</s> <s sid="85" id="NorthS.c2.s85">Now there were only the well-bound little-read English Classics, which were weeded out of her father's library to fill up the small book-shelves in the drawing-room.</s> <s sid="86" id="NorthS.c2.s86">Thomson's Seasons, Hayley's Cowper, Middleton's Cicero, were by far the lightest, newest, and most amusing.</s> <s sid="87" id="NorthS.c2.s87">The book-shelves did not afford much resource.</s> <s sid="88" id="NorthS.c2.s88">Margaret told her mother every particular of her London life, to all of which Mrs. Hale listened with interest, sometimes amused and questioning, at others a little inclined to compare her sister's circumstances of ease and comfort with the narrower means at Helstone vicarage.</s> <s sid="89" id="NorthS.c2.s89">On such evenings Margaret was apt to stop talking rather abruptly, and listen to the drip-drip of the rain upon the leads of the little bow-window.</s> <s sid="90" id="NorthS.c2.s90">Once or twice Margaret found herself mechanically counting the repetition of the monotonous sound, while she wondered if she might venture to put a question on a subject very near to her heart, and ask where Frederick was now; what he was doing; how long it was since they had heard from him.</s> <s sid="91" id="NorthS.c2.s91">But a consciousness that her mother's delicate health, and positive dislike to Helstone, all dated from the time of the mutiny in which Frederick had been engaged,--the full account of which Margaret had never heard, and which now seemed doomed to be buried in sad oblivion,--made her pause and turn away from the subject each time she approached it.</s> <s sid="92" id="NorthS.c2.s92">When she was with her mother, her father seemed the best person to apply to for information; and when with him, she thought that she could speak more easily to her mother.</s> <s sid="93" id="NorthS.c2.s93">Probably there was nothing much to be heard that was new.</s> <s sid="94" id="NorthS.c2.s94">In one of the letters she had received before leaving Harley Street, her father had told her that they had heard from Frederick; he was still at Rio, and very well in health, and sent his best love to her; which was dry bones, but not the living intelligence she longed for.</s> <s sid="95" id="NorthS.c2.s95">Frederick was always spoken of, in the rare times when his name was mentioned, as <qs/>'Poor Frederick.'<qe/></s> <s sid="96" id="NorthS.c2.s96">His room was kept exactly as he had left it; and was regularly dusted, and put into order by Dixon, Mrs. Hale's maid, who touched no other part of the household work, but always remembered the day when she had been engaged by Lady Beresford as ladies' maid to Sir John's wards, the pretty Miss Beresfords, the belles of Rutlandshire.</s> <s sid="97" id="NorthS.c2.s97">Dixon had always considered Mr. Hale as the blight which had fallen upon her young lady's prospects in life.</s> <s sid="98" id="NorthS.c2.s98">If Miss Beresford had not been in such a hurry to marry a poor country clergyman, there was no knowing what she might not have become.</s> <s sid="99" id="NorthS.c2.s99">But Dixon was too loyal to desert her in her affliction and downfall (alias her married life).</s> <s sid="100" id="NorthS.c2.s100">She remained with her, and was devoted to her interests; always considering herself as the good and protecting fairy, whose duty it was to baffle the malignant giant, Mr. Hale.</s> <s sid="101" id="NorthS.c2.s101">Master Frederick had been her favorite and pride; and it was with a little softening of her dignified look and manner, that she went in weekly to arrange the chamber as carefully as if he might be coming home that very evening.</s> <s sid="102" id="NorthS.c2.s102">Margaret could not help believing that there had been some late intelligence of Frederick, unknown to her mother, which was making her father anxious and uneasy.</s> <s sid="103" id="NorthS.c2.s103">Mrs. Hale did not seem to perceive any alteration in her husband's looks or ways.</s> <s sid="104" id="NorthS.c2.s104">His spirits were always tender and gentle, readily affected by any small piece of intelligence concerning the welfare of others.</s> <s sid="105" id="NorthS.c2.s105">He would be depressed for many days after witnessing a death-bed, or hearing of any crime.</s> <s sid="106" id="NorthS.c2.s106">But now Margaret noticed an absence of mind, as if his thoughts were pre-occupied by some subject, the oppression of which could not be relieved by any daily action, such as comforting the survivors, or teaching at the school in hope of lessening the evils in the generation to come.</s> <s sid="107" id="NorthS.c2.s107">Mr. Hale did not go out among his parishioners as much as usual; he was more shut up in his study; was anxious for the village postman, whose summons to the house-hold was a rap on the back-kitchen window-shutter--a signal which at one time had often to be repeated before any one was sufficiently alive to the hour of the day to understand what it was, and attend to him.</s> <s sid="108" id="NorthS.c2.s108">Now Mr. Hale loitered about the garden if the morning was fine, and if not, stood dreamily by the study window until the postman had called, or gone down the lane, giving a half-respectful, half-confidential shake of the head to the parson, who watched him away beyond the sweet-briar hedge, and past the great arbutus, before he turned into the room to begin his day's work, with all the signs of a heavy heart and an occupied mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="NorthS.c2.p15" type="speech"><s sid="109" id="NorthS.c2.s109">But Margaret was at an age when any apprehension, not absolutely based on a knowledge of facts, is easily banished for a time by a bright sunny day, or some happy outward circumstance.</s> <s sid="110" id="NorthS.c2.s110">And when the brilliant fourteen fine days of October came on, her cares were all blown away as lightly as thistledown, and she thought of nothing but the glories of the forest.</s> <s sid="111" id="NorthS.c2.s111">The fern-harvest was over, and now that the rain was gone, many a deep glade was accessible, into which Margaret had only peeped in July and August weather.</s> <s sid="112" id="NorthS.c2.s112">She had learnt drawing with Edith; and she had sufficiently regretted, during the gloom of the bad weather, her idle revelling in the beauty of the woodlands while it had yet been fine, to make her determined to sketch what she could before winter fairly set in.</s> <s sid="113" id="NorthS.c2.s113">Accordingly, she was busy preparing her board one morning, when Sarah, the housemaid, threw wide open the drawing-room door and announced, <qs/>'Mr. Henry Lennox.'<qe/></s> </p></div>

<p pid="5" id="NorthS.c6.p5"><s sid="6" id="NorthS.c6.s6">The last day came; the house was full of packing-cases, which were being carted off at the front door, to the nearest railway station.</s> <s sid="7" id="NorthS.c6.s7">Even the pretty lawn at the side of the house was made unsightly and untidy by the straw that had been wafted upon it through the open door and windows.</s> <s sid="8" id="NorthS.c6.s8">The rooms had a strange echoing sound in them,--and the light came harshly and strongly in through the uncurtained windows,--seeming already unfamiliar and strange.</s> <s sid="9" id="NorthS.c6.s9">Mrs. Hale's dressing-room was left untouched to the last; and there she and Dixon were packing up clothes, and interrupting each other every now and then to exclaim at, and turn over with fond regard, some forgotten treasure, in the shape of some relic of the children while they were yet little.</s> <s sid="10" id="NorthS.c6.s10">They did not make much progress with their work.</s> <s sid="11" id="NorthS.c6.s11">Down-stairs, Margaret stood calm and collected, ready to counsel or advise the men who had been called in to help the cook and Charlotte.</s> <s sid="12" id="NorthS.c6.s12">These two last, crying between whiles, wondered how the young lady could keep up so this last day, and settled it between them that she was not likely to care much for Helstone, having been so long in London.</s> <s sid="13" id="NorthS.c6.s13">There she stood, very pale and quiet, with her large grave eyes observing everything,--up to every present circumstance, however small.</s> <s sid="14" id="NorthS.c6.s14">They could not understand how her heart was aching all the time, with a heavy pressure that no sighs could lift off or relieve, and how constant exertion for her perceptive faculties was the only way to keep herself from crying out with pain.</s> <s sid="15" id="NorthS.c6.s15">Moreover, if she gave way, who was to act?</s> <s sid="16" id="NorthS.c6.s16">Her father was examining papers, books, registers, what not, in the vestry with the clerk; and when he came in, there were his own books to pack up, which no one but himself could do to his satisfaction.</s> <s sid="17" id="NorthS.c6.s17">Besides, was Margaret one to give way before strange men, or even household friends like the cook and Charlotte!</s> <s sid="18" id="NorthS.c6.s18">Not she.</s> <s sid="19" id="NorthS.c6.s19">But at last the four packers went into the kitchen to their tea; and Margaret moved stiffly and slowly away from the place in the hall where she had been standing so long, out through the bare echoing drawing-room, into the twilight of an early November evening.</s> <s sid="20" id="NorthS.c6.s20">There was a filmy veil of soft dull mist obscuring, but not hiding, all objects, giving them a lilac hue, for the sun had not yet fully set; a robin was singing,--perhaps, Margaret thought, the very robin that her father had so often talked of as his winter pet, and for which he had made, with his own hands, a kind of robin-house by his study-window.</s> <s sid="21" id="NorthS.c6.s21">The leaves were more gorgeous than ever; the first touch of frost would lay them all low on the ground.</s> <s sid="22" id="NorthS.c6.s22">Already one or two kept constantly floating down, amber and golden in the low slanting sun-rays.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="NorthS.c6.p6"><s sid="23" id="NorthS.c6.s23">Margaret went along the walk under the pear-tree wall.</s> <s sid="24" id="NorthS.c6.s24">She had never been along it since she paced it at Henry Lennox's side.</s> <s sid="25" id="NorthS.c6.s25">Here, at this bed of thyme, he began to speak of what she must not think of now.</s> <s sid="26" id="NorthS.c6.s26">Her eyes were on that late-blowing rose as she was trying to answer; and she had caught the idea of the vivid beauty of the feathery leaves of the carrots in the very middle of his last sentence.</s> <s sid="27" id="NorthS.c6.s27">Only a fortnight ago And all so changed!</s> <s sid="28" id="NorthS.c6.s28">Where was he now?</s> <s sid="29" id="NorthS.c6.s29">In London,--going through the old round; dining with the old Harley Street set, or with gayer young friends of his own.</s> <s sid="30" id="NorthS.c6.s30">Even now, while she walked sadly through that damp and drear garden in the dusk, with everything falling and fading, and turning to decay around her, he might be gladly putting away his law-books after a day of satisfactory toil, and freshening himself up, as he had told her he often did, by a run in the Temple Gardens, taking in the while the grand inarticulate mighty roar of tens of thousands of busy men, nigh at hand, but not seen, and catching ever, at his quick turns, glimpses of the lights of the city coming up out of the depths of the river.</s> <s sid="31" id="NorthS.c6.s31">He had often spoken to Margaret of these hasty walks, snatched in the intervals between study and dinner.</s> <s sid="32" id="NorthS.c6.s32">At his best times and in his best moods had he spoken of them; and the thought of them had struck upon her fancy.</s> <s sid="33" id="NorthS.c6.s33">Here there was no sound.</s> <s sid="34" id="NorthS.c6.s34">The robin had gone away into the vast stillness of night.</s> <s sid="35" id="NorthS.c6.s35">Now and then, a cottage door in the distance was opened and shut, as if to admit the tired labourer to his home; but that sounded very far away.</s> <s sid="36" id="NorthS.c6.s36">A stealthy, creeping, cranching sound among the crisp fallen leaves of the forest, beyond the garden, seemed almost close at hand.</s> <s sid="37" id="NorthS.c6.s37">Margaret knew it was some poacher.</s> <s sid="38" id="NorthS.c6.s38">Sitting up in her bed-room this past autumn, with the light of her candle extinguished, and purely revelling in the solemn beauty of the heavens and the earth, she had many a time seen the light noiseless leap of the poachers over the garden-fence, their quick tramp across the dewy moonlit lawn, their disappearance in the black still shadow beyond.</s> <s sid="39" id="NorthS.c6.s39">The wild adventurous freedom of their life had taken her fancy; she felt inclined to wish them success; she had no fear of them.</s> <s sid="40" id="NorthS.c6.s40">But to-night she was afraid, she knew not why.</s> <s sid="41" id="NorthS.c6.s41">She heard Charlotte shutting the windows, and fastening up for the night, unconscious that any one had gone out into the garden.</s> <s sid="42" id="NorthS.c6.s42">A small branch--it might be of rotten wood, or it might be broken by force--came heavily down in the nearest part of the forest, Margaret ran, swift as Camilla, down to the window, and rapped at it with a hurried tremulousness which startled Charlotte within.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="NorthS.c6.p8" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="NorthS.c6.s49"><qs/>'I was afraid you were shutting me out altogether, Charlotte,'<qe/> said she, half-smiling.</s> <s sid="50" id="NorthS.c6.s50"><qs/>'And then you would never have heard me in the kitchen, and the doors into the lane and churchyard are locked long ago.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="NorthS.c6.p9" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="NorthS.c6.s51"><qs/>'Oh, miss, I should have been sure to have missed you soon.</s> <s sid="52" id="NorthS.c6.s52">The men would have wanted you to tell them how to go on.</s> <s sid="53" id="NorthS.c6.s53">And I have put tea in master's study, as being the most comfortable room, so to speak.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="NorthS.c6.p15" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="NorthS.c6.s81"><qs/>'No, father,'<qe/> said Margaret, looking straight at him, and speaking low and steadily.</s> <s sid="82" id="NorthS.c6.s82"><qs/>'It is bad to believe you in error.</s> <s sid="83" id="NorthS.c6.s83">It would he infinitely worse to have known you a hypocrite.'<qe/></s> <s sid="84" id="NorthS.c6.s84">She dropped her voice at the last few words, as if entertaining the idea of hypocrisy for a moment in connection with her father savoured of irreverence.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="NorthS.c6.p16" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="NorthS.c6.s85"><qs/>'Besides,'<qe/><sss/> she went on, <sse/><qs/>'it is only that I am tired to-night; don't think that I am suffering from what you have done, dear papa.</s> <s sid="86" id="NorthS.c6.s86">We can't either of us talk about it to-night, I believe,'<qe/> said she, finding that tears and sobs would come in spite of herself.</s> <s sid="87" id="NorthS.c6.s87"><qs/>'I had better go and take mamma up this cup of tea.</s> <s sid="88" id="NorthS.c6.s88">She had hers very early, when I was too busy to go to her, and I am sure she will be glad of another now.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="NorthS.c6.p18"><s sid="94" id="NorthS.c6.s94">They were to stop in London all night at some quiet hotel.</s> <s sid="95" id="NorthS.c6.s95">Poor Mrs. Hale had cried in her way nearly all day long; and Dixon showed her sorrow by extreme crossness, and a continual irritable attempt to keep her petticoats from even touching the unconscious Mr. Hale, whom she regarded as the origin of all this suffering.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="NorthS.c6.p19"><s sid="96" id="NorthS.c6.s96">They went through the well-known streets, past houses which they had often visited, past shops in which she had lounged, impatient, by her aunt's side, while that lady was making some important and interminable decision-nay, absolutely past acquaintances in the streets; for though the morning had been of an incalculable length to them, and they felt as if it ought long ago to have closed in for the repose of darkness, it was the very busiest time of a London afternoon in November when they arrived there.</s> <s sid="97" id="NorthS.c6.s97">It was long since Mrs. Hale had been in London; and she roused up, almost like a child, to look about her at the different streets, and to gaze after and exclaim at the shops and carriages.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="NorthS.c6.p20" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="NorthS.c6.s98"><qs/>'Oh, there's Harrison's, where I bought so many of my wedding-things.</s> <s sid="99" id="NorthS.c6.s99">Dear! how altered!</s> <s sid="100" id="NorthS.c6.s100">They've got immense plate-glass windows, larger than Crawford's in Southampton.</s> <s sid="101" id="NorthS.c6.s101">Oh, and there, I declare--no, it is not--yes, it is--Margaret, we have just passed Mr. Henry Lennox.</s> <s sid="102" id="NorthS.c6.s102">Where can he be going, among all these shops?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="NorthS.c6.p21"><s sid="103" id="NorthS.c6.s103">Margaret started forwards, and as quickly fell back, half-smiling at herself for the sudden motion.</s> <s sid="104" id="NorthS.c6.s104">They were a hundred yards away by this time; but he seemed like a relic of Helstone--he was associated with a bright morning, an eventful day, and she should have liked to have seen him, without his seeing her,--without the chance of their speaking.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="NorthS.c6.p22" type="speech"><s sid="105" id="NorthS.c6.s105">The evening, without employment, passed in a room high up in an hotel, was long and heavy.</s> <s sid="106" id="NorthS.c6.s106">Mr. Hale went out to his bookseller's, and to call on a friend or two.</s> <s sid="107" id="NorthS.c6.s107">Every one they saw, either in the house or out in the streets, appeared hurrying to some appointment, expected by, or expecting somebody.</s> <s sid="108" id="NorthS.c6.s108">They alone seemed strange and friendless, and desolate.</s> <s sid="109" id="NorthS.c6.s109">Yet within a mile, Margaret knew of house after house, where she for her own sake, and her mother for her aunt Shaw's, would be welcomed, if they came in gladness, or even in peace of mind.</s> <s sid="110" id="NorthS.c6.s110">If they came sorrowing, and wanting sympathy in a complicated trouble like the present, then they would be felt as a shadow in all these houses of intimate acquaintances, not friends.</s> <s sid="111" id="NorthS.c6.s111">London life is too whirling and full to admit of even an hour of that deep silence of feeling which the friends of Job showed, when <qs/>'they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him; for they saw that his grief was very great.'<qe/></s> </p></div>

<p pid="3" id="NorthS.c7.p3"><s sid="13" id="NorthS.c7.s13">Their two nights at hotels had cost more than Mr. Hale had anticipated, and they were glad to take the first clean, cheerful for the first time for many days, did Margaret feel at rest.</s> <s sid="14" id="NorthS.c7.s14">There rooms they met with that were at liberty to receive them.</s> <s sid="15" id="NorthS.c7.s15">There, was a dreaminess in the rest, too, which made it still more perfect and luxurious to repose in.</s> <s sid="16" id="NorthS.c7.s16">The distant sea, lapping the sandy shore with measured sound; the nearer cries of the donkey-boys; the unusual scenes moving before her like pictures, which she cared not in her laziness to have fully explained before they passed away; the stroll down to the beach to breathe the sea-air, soft and warm on that sandy shore even to the end of November; the great long misty sea-line touching the tender-coloured sky; the white sail of a distant boat turning silver in some pale sunbeam:--it seemed as if she could dream her life away in such luxury of pensiveness, in which she made her present all in all, from not daring to think of the past, or wishing to contemplate the future.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="NorthS.c7.p5"><s sid="21" id="NorthS.c7.s21">For several miles before they reached Milton, they saw a deep lead-coloured cloud hanging over the horizon in the direction in which it lay.</s> <s sid="22" id="NorthS.c7.s22">It was all the darker from contrast with the pale gray-blue of the wintry sky; for in Heston there had been the earliest signs of frost.</s> <s sid="23" id="NorthS.c7.s23">Nearer to the town, the air had a faint taste and smell of smoke; perhaps, after all, more a loss of the fragrance of grass and herbage than any positive taste or smell.</s> <s sid="24" id="NorthS.c7.s24">Quick they were whirled over long, straight, hopeless streets of regularly-built houses, all small and of brick.</s> <s sid="25" id="NorthS.c7.s25">Here and there a great oblong many-windowed factory stood up, like a hen among her chickens, puffing out black 'unparliamentary' smoke, and sufficiently accounting for the cloud which Margaret had taken to foretell rain.</s> <s sid="26" id="NorthS.c7.s26">As they drove through the larger and wider streets, from the station to the hotel, they had to stop constantly; great loaded lurries blocked up the not over-wide thoroughfares.</s> <s sid="27" id="NorthS.c7.s27">Margaret had now and then been into the city in her drives with her aunt.</s> <s sid="28" id="NorthS.c7.s28">But there the heavy lumbering vehicles seemed various in their purposes and intent; here every van, every waggon and truck, bore cotton, either in the raw shape in bags, or the woven shape in bales of calico.</s> <s sid="29" id="NorthS.c7.s29">People thronged the footpaths, most of them well-dressed as regarded the material, but with a slovenly looseness which struck Margaret as different from the shabby, threadbare smartness of a similar class in London.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="NorthS.c8.p12"><s sid="72" id="NorthS.c8.s72">Margaret rather encouraged this light, merry way of viewing her father's acquaintance with Mr. Thornton, because she felt that her mother was inclined to look upon this new friendship of her husband's with jealous eyes.</s> <s sid="73" id="NorthS.c8.s73">As long as his time had been solely occupied with his books and his parishioners, as at Helstone, she had appeared to care little whether she saw much of him or not; but now that he looked eagerly forward to each renewal of his intercourse with Mr. Thornton, she seemed hurt and annoyed, as if he were slighting her companionship for the first time.</s> <s sid="74" id="NorthS.c8.s74">Mr. Hale's over-praise had the usual effect of over-praise upon his auditors; they were a little inclined to rebel against Aristides being always called the Just.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="NorthS.c8.p13"><s sid="75" id="NorthS.c8.s75">After a quiet life in a country parsonage for more than twenty years, there was something dazzling to Mr. Hale in the energy which conquered immense difficulties with ease; the power of the machinery of Milton, the power of the men of Milton, impressed him with a sense of grandeur, which he yielded to without caring to inquire into the details of its exercise.</s> <s sid="76" id="NorthS.c8.s76">But Margaret went less abroad, among machinery and men; saw less of power in its public effect, and, as it happened, she was thrown with one or two of those who, in all measures affecting masses of people, must be acute sufferers for the good of many.</s> <s sid="77" id="NorthS.c8.s77">The question always is, has everything been done to make the sufferings of these exceptions as small as possible?</s> <s sid="78" id="NorthS.c8.s78">Or, in the triumph of the crowded procession, have the helpless been trampled on, instead of being gently lifted aside out of the roadway of the conqueror, whom they have no power to accompany on his march?</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="NorthS.c8.p14"><s sid="79" id="NorthS.c8.s79">It fell to Margaret's share to have to look out for a servant to assist Dixon, who had at first undertaken to find just the person she wanted to do all the rough work of the house.</s> <s sid="80" id="NorthS.c8.s80">But Dixon's ideas of helpful girls were founded on the recollection of tidy elder scholars at Helstone school, who were only too proud to be allowed to come to the parsonage on a busy day, and treated Mrs. Dixon with all the respect, and a good deal more of fright, which they paid to Mr. and Mrs. Hale.</s> <s sid="81" id="NorthS.c8.s81">Dixon was not unconscious of this awed reverence which was given to her; nor did she dislike it; it flattered her much as Louis the Fourteenth was flattered by his courtiers shading their eyes from the dazzling light of his presence.'</s> <s sid="82" id="NorthS.c8.s82">But nothing short of her faithful love for Mrs. Hale could have made her endure the rough independent way in which all the Milton girls, who made application for the servant's place, replied to her inquiries respecting their qualifications.</s> <s sid="83" id="NorthS.c8.s83">They even went the length of questioning her back again; having doubts and fears of their own, as to the solvency of a family who lived in a house of thirty pounds a-year, and yet gave themselves airs, and kept two servants, one of them so very high and mighty.</s> <s sid="84" id="NorthS.c8.s84">Mr. Hale was no longer looked upon as Vicar of Helstone, but as a man who only spent at a certain rate.</s> <s sid="85" id="NorthS.c8.s85">Margaret was weary and impatient of the accounts which Dixon perpetually brought to Mrs. Hale of the behaviour of these would-be servants.</s> <s sid="86" id="NorthS.c8.s86">Not but what Margaret was repelled by the rough uncourteous manners of these people; not but what she shrunk with fastidious pride from their hail-fellow accost and severely resented their unconcealed curiosity as to the means and position of any family who lived in Milton, and yet were not engaged in trade of some kind.</s> <s sid="87" id="NorthS.c8.s87">But the more Margaret felt impertinence, the more likely she was to be silent on the subject; and, at any rate, if she took upon herself to make inquiry for a servant, she could spare her mother the recital of all her disappointments and fancied or real insults.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="NorthS.c8.p15"><s sid="88" id="NorthS.c8.s88">Margaret accordingly went up and down to butchers and grocers, seeking for a nonpareil of a girl; and lowering her hopes and expectations every week, as she found the difficulty of meeting with any one in a manufacturing town who did not prefer the better wages and greater independence of working in a mill.</s> <s sid="89" id="NorthS.c8.s89">It was something of a trial to Margaret to go out by herself in this busy bustling place.</s> <s sid="90" id="NorthS.c8.s90">Mrs. Shaw's ideas of propriety and her own helpless dependence on others, had always made her insist that a footman should accompany Edith and Margaret, if they went beyond Harley Street or the immediate neighbourhood.</s> <s sid="91" id="NorthS.c8.s91">The limits by which this rule of her aunt's had circumscribed Margaret's independence had been silently rebelled against at the time: and she had doubly enjoyed the free walks and rambles of her forest life, from the contrast which they presented.</s> <s sid="92" id="NorthS.c8.s92">She went along there with a bounding fearless step, that occasionally broke out into a run, if she were in a hurry, and occasionally was stilled into perfect repose, as she stood listening to, or watching any of the wild creatures who sang in the leafy courts, or glanced out with their keen bright eyes from the low brushwood or tangled furze.</s> <s sid="93" id="NorthS.c8.s93">It was a trial to come down from such motion or such stillness, only guided by her own sweet will, to the even and decorous pace necessary in streets.</s> <s sid="94" id="NorthS.c8.s94">But she could have laughed at herself for minding this change, if it had not been accompanied by what was a more serious annoyance.</s> <s sid="95" id="NorthS.c8.s95">The side of the town on which Crampton lay was especially a thoroughfare for the factory people.</s> <s sid="96" id="NorthS.c8.s96">In the back streets around them there were many mills, out of which poured streams of men and women two or three times a day.</s> <s sid="97" id="NorthS.c8.s97">Until Margaret had learnt the times of their ingress and egress, she was very unfortunate in constantly falling in with them.</s> <s sid="98" id="NorthS.c8.s98">They came rushing along, with bold, fearless faces, and loud laughs and jests, particularly aimed at all those who appeared to be above them in rank or station.</s> <s sid="99" id="NorthS.c8.s99">The tones of their unrestrained voices, and their carelessness of all common rules of street politeness, frightened Margaret a little at first.</s> <s sid="100" id="NorthS.c8.s100">The girls, with their rough, but not unfriendly freedom, would comment on her dress, even touch her shawl or gown to ascertain the exact material; nay, once or twice she was asked questions relative to some article which they particularly admired.</s> <s sid="101" id="NorthS.c8.s101">There was such a simple reliance on her womanly sympathy with their love of dress, and on her kindliness, that she gladly replied to these inquiries, as soon as she understood them; and half smiled back at their remarks.</s> <s sid="102" id="NorthS.c8.s102">She did not mind meeting any number of girls, loud spoken and boisterous though they might be.</s> <s sid="103" id="NorthS.c8.s103">But she alternately dreaded and fired up against the workmen, who commented not on her dress, but on her looks, in the same open fearless manner.</s> <s sid="104" id="NorthS.c8.s104">She, who had hitherto felt that even the most refined remark on her personal appearance was an impertinence, had to endure undisguised admiration from these outspoken men.</s> <s sid="105" id="NorthS.c8.s105">But the very out-spokenness marked their innocence of any intention to hurt her delicacy, as she would have perceived if she had been less frightened by the disorderly tumult.</s> <s sid="106" id="NorthS.c8.s106">Out of her fright came a flash of indignation which made her face scarlet, and her dark eyes gather flame, as she heard some of their speeches.</s> <s sid="107" id="NorthS.c8.s107">Yet there were other sayings of theirs, which, when she reached the quiet safety of home, amused her even while they irritated her.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="NorthS.c47.p15" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="NorthS.c47.s60">One of the great pleasures of Margaret's life at this time, was in Edith's boy.</s> <s sid="61" id="NorthS.c47.s61">He was the pride and plaything of both father and mother, as long as he was good; but he had a strong will of his own, and as soon as he burst out into one of his stormy passions, Edith would throw herself back in despair and fatigue, and sigh out, <qs/>'Oh dear, what shall I do with him!</s> <s sid="62" id="NorthS.c47.s62">Do, Margaret, please ring the bell for Hanley.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="NorthS.c47.p16"><s sid="63" id="NorthS.c47.s63">But Margaret almost liked him better in these manifestations of character than in his good blue-sashed moods.</s> <s sid="64" id="NorthS.c47.s64">She would carry him off into a room, where they two alone battled it out; she with a firm power which subdued him into peace, while every sudden charm and wile she possessed, was exerted on the side of right, until he would rub his little hot and tear-smeared face all over hers, kissing and caressing till he often fell asleep in her arms or on her shoulder.</s> <s sid="65" id="NorthS.c47.s65">Those were Margaret's sweetest moments.</s> <s sid="66" id="NorthS.c47.s66">They gave her a taste of the feeling that she believed would be denied to her for ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="NorthS.c47.p18"><s sid="71" id="NorthS.c47.s71">But the brothers were much attached to each other, in the way that any two persons are, when the one is cleverer and always leads the other, and this last is patiently content to be led.</s> <s sid="72" id="NorthS.c47.s72">Mr. Lennox was pushing on in his profession; cultivating, with profound calculation, all those connections that might eventually be of service to him; keen-sighted, far-seeing, intelligent, sarcastic, and proud.</s> <s sid="73" id="NorthS.c47.s73">Since the one long conversation relating to Frederick's affairs, which she had with him the first evening in Mr. Bell's presence, she had had no great intercourse with him, further than that which arose out of their close relations with the same household.</s> <s sid="74" id="NorthS.c47.s74">But this was enough to wear off the shyness on her side, and any symptoms of mortified pride and vanity on his.</s> <s sid="75" id="NorthS.c47.s75">They met continually, of course, but she thought that he rather avoided being alone with her; she fancied that he, as well as she, perceived that they had drifted strangely apart from their former anchorage, side by side, in many of their opinions, and all their tastes.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="NorthS.c47.p19"><s sid="76" id="NorthS.c47.s76">And yet, when he had spoken unusually well, or with remarkable epigrammatic point, she felt that his eye sought the expression of her countenance first of all, if but for an instant; and that, in the family intercourse which constantly threw them together, her opinion was the one to which he listened with a deference,--the more complete, because it was reluctantly paid, and concealed as much as possible.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="3" id="NorthS.c50.p3" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="NorthS.c50.s16">But the truth was, Mr. Thornton was hard pressed.</s> <s sid="17" id="NorthS.c50.s17">He felt it acutely in his vulnerable point--his pride in the commercial character which he had established for himself.</s> <s sid="18" id="NorthS.c50.s18">Architect of his own fortunes, he attributed this to no special merit or qualities of his own, but to the power, which he believed that commerce gave to every brave, honest, and persevering man, to raise himself to a level from which he might see and read the great game of worldly success, and honestly, by such far-sightedness, command more power and influence than in any other mode of life.</s> <s sid="19" id="NorthS.c50.s19">Far away, in the East and in the West, where his person would never be known, his name was to be regarded, and his wishes to be fulfilled, and his word pass like gold.</s> <s sid="20" id="NorthS.c50.s20">That was the idea of merchant-life with which Mr. Thornton had started.</s> <s sid="21" id="NorthS.c50.s21"><qs/>'Her merchants be like princes,'<qe/> said his mother, reading the text aloud, as if it were a trumpet-call to invite her boy to the struggle.</s> <s sid="22" id="NorthS.c50.s22">He was but like many others--men, women, and children--alive to distant, and dead to near things.</s> <s sid="23" id="NorthS.c50.s23">He sought to possess the influence of a name in foreign countries and far-away seas,--to become the head of a firm that should be known for generations; and it had taken him long silent years to come even to a glimmering of what he might be now, to-day, here in his own town, his own factory, among his own people.</s> <s sid="24" id="NorthS.c50.s24">He and they had led parallel lives--very close, but never touching--till the accident (or so it seemed) of his acquaintance with Higgins.</s> <s sid="25" id="NorthS.c50.s25">Once brought face to face, man to man, with an individual of the masses around him, and (take notice) out of the character of master and workman, in the first instance, they had each begun to recognise that <qs/>'we have all of us one human heart.'<qe/></s> <s sid="26" id="NorthS.c50.s26">It was the fine point of the wedge; and until now, when the apprehension of losing his connection with two or three of the workmen whom he had so lately begun to know as men,--of having a plan or two, which were experiments lying very close to his heart, roughly nipped off without trial,--gave a new poignancy to the subtle fear that came over him from time to time; until now, he had never recognised how much and how deep was the interest he had grown of late to feel in his position as manufacturer, simply because it led him into such close contact, and gave him the opportunity of so much power, among a race of people strange, shrewd, ignorant; but, above all, full of character and strong human feeling.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="NorthS.c50.p4"><s sid="27" id="NorthS.c50.s27">He reviewed his position as a Milton manufacturer.</s> <s sid="28" id="NorthS.c50.s28">The strike a year and a half ago,--or more, for it was now untimely wintry weather, in a late spring,--that strike, when he was young, and he now was old--had prevented his completing some of the large orders he had then on hand.</s> <s sid="29" id="NorthS.c50.s29">He had locked up a good deal of his capital in new and expensive machinery, and he had also bought cotton largely, for the fulfilment of these orders, taken under contract.</s> <s sid="30" id="NorthS.c50.s30">That he had not been able to complete them, was owing in some degree to the utter want of skill on the part of the Irish hands whom he had imported; much of their work was damaged and unfit to be sent forth by a house which prided itself on turning out nothing but first-rate articles.</s> <s sid="31" id="NorthS.c50.s31">For many months, the embarrassment caused by the strike had been an obstacle in Mr. Thornton's way; and often, when his eye fell on Higgins, he could have spoken angrily to him without any present cause, just from feeling how serious was the injury that had arisen from this affair in which he was implicated.</s> <s sid="32" id="NorthS.c50.s32">But when he became conscious of this sudden, quick resentment, he resolved to curb it.</s> <s sid="33" id="NorthS.c50.s33">It would not satisfy him to avoid Higgins; he must convince himself that he was master over his own anger, by being particularly careful to allow Higgins access to him, whenever the strict rules of business, or Mr. Thornton's leisure permitted.</s> <s sid="34" id="NorthS.c50.s34">And by-and-bye, he lost all sense of resentment in wonder how it was, or could be, that two men like himself and Higgins, living by the same trade, working in their different ways at the same object, could look upon each other's position and duties in so strangely different a way.</s> <s sid="35" id="NorthS.c50.s35">And thence arose that intercourse, which though it might not have the effect of preventing all future clash of opinion and action, when the occasion arose, would, at any rate, enable both master and man to look upon each other with far more charity and sympathy, and bear with each other more patiently and kindly.</s> <s sid="36" id="NorthS.c50.s36">Besides this improvement of feeling, both Mr. Thornton and his workmen found out their ignorance as to positive matters of fact, known heretofore to one side, but not to the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="NorthS.c50.p5" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="NorthS.c50.s37">But now had come one of those periods of bad trade, when the market falling brought down the value of all large stocks; Mr. Thornton's fell to nearly half.</s> <s sid="38" id="NorthS.c50.s38">No orders were coming in; so he lost the interest of the capital he had locked up in machinery; indeed, it was difficult to get payment for the orders completed; yet there was the constant drain of expenses for working the business.</s> <s sid="39" id="NorthS.c50.s39">Then the bills became due for the cotton he had purchased; and money being scarce, he could only borrow at exorbitant interest, and yet he could not realise any of his property.</s> <s sid="40" id="NorthS.c50.s40">But he did not despair; he exerted himself day and night to foresee and to provide for all emergencies; he was as calm and gentle to the women in his home as ever; to the workmen in his mill he spoke not many words, but they knew him by this time; and many a curt, decided answer was received by them rather with sympathy for the care they saw pressing upon him, than with the suppressed antagonism which had formerly been smouldering, and ready for hard words and hard judgments on all occasions.</s> <s sid="41" id="NorthS.c50.s41"><qs/>'Th' measter's a deal to potter him,'<qe/> said Higgins, one day, as he heard Mr. Thornton's short, sharp inquiry, why such a command had not been obeyed; and caught the sound of the suppressed sigh which he heaved in going past the room where some of the men were working.</s> <s sid="42" id="NorthS.c50.s42">Higgins and another man stopped over-hours that night, unknown to any one, to get the neglected piece of work done; and Mr. Thornton never knew but that the overlooker, to whom he had given the command in the first instance, had done it himself</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="NorthS.c50.p7" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="NorthS.c50.s46"><qs/>'Measter,'<qe/> said he, stopping his employer in his quick resolved walk, and causing that gentleman to look up with a sudden annoyed start, as if his thoughts had been far away.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="NorthS.c50.p11" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="NorthS.c50.s50"><qs/>'Oh yes!'<qe/> and suddenly, the wintry frost-bound look of care had left Mr. Thornton's face, as if some soft summer gale had blown all anxiety away from his mind; and though his mouth was as much compressed as before, his eyes smiled out benignly on his questioner.</s> </p>
