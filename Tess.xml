<p pid="17" id="Tess.c1.p17"><s sid="32" id="Tess.c1.s32">The clergyman explained that, as far as he was aware, it had quite died out of knowledge, and could hardly be said to be known at all.</s> <s sid="33" id="Tess.c1.s33">His own investigations had begun on a day in the preceding spring when, having been engaged in tracing the vicissitudes of the d'Urberville family, he had observed Durbeyfield's name on his waggon, and had thereupon been led to make inquiries about his father and grandfather till he had no doubt on the subject.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="Tess.c1.p35"><s sid="66" id="Tess.c1.s66">When he was gone, Durbeyfield walked a few steps in a profound reverie, and then sat down upon the grassy bank by the roadside, depositing his basket before him.</s> <s sid="67" id="Tess.c1.s67">In a few minutes a youth appeared in the distance, walking in the same direction as that which had been pursued by Durbeyfield.</s> <s sid="68" id="Tess.c1.s68">The latter, on seeing him, held up his hand, and the lad quickened his pace and came near.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="Tess.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="Tess.c2.s1">The village of Marlott lay amid the north-eastern undulations of the beautiful Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor, aforesaid, an engirdled and secluded region, for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or landscape-painter, though within a four hours' journey from London.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Tess.c2.p2"><s sid="2" id="Tess.c2.s2">It is a vale whose acquaintance is best made by viewing it from the summits of the hills that surround it--except perhaps during the droughts of summer.</s> <s sid="3" id="Tess.c2.s3">An unguided ramble into its recesses in bad weather is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow, tortuous, and miry ways.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Tess.c2.p3"><s sid="4" id="Tess.c2.s4">This fertile and sheltered tract of country, in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry, is bounded on the south by the bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of Hambledon Hill, Bulbarrow, Nettlecombe-Tout, Dogbury, High Stoy, and Bubb Down.</s> <s sid="5" id="Tess.c2.s5">The traveller from the coast, who, after plodding northward for a score of miles over calcareous downs and corn-lands, suddenly reaches the verge of one of these escarpments, is surprised and delighted to behold, extended like a map beneath him, a country differing absolutely from that which he has passed through.</s> <s sid="6" id="Tess.c2.s6">Behind him the hills are open, the sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give an unenclosed character to the landscape, the lanes are white, the hedges low and plashed, the atmosphere colourless.</s> <s sid="7" id="Tess.c2.s7">Here, in the valley, the world seems to be constructed upon a smaller and more delicate scale; the fields are mere paddocks, so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark green threads overspreading the paler green of the grass.</s> <s sid="8" id="Tess.c2.s8">The atmosphere beneath is languorous, and is so tinged with azure that what artists call the middle distance partakes also of that hue, while the horizon beyond is of the deepest ultramarine.</s> <s sid="9" id="Tess.c2.s9">Arable lands are few and limited; with but slight exceptions the prospect is a broad rich mass of grass and trees, mantling minor hills and dales within the major.</s> <s sid="10" id="Tess.c2.s10">Such is the Vale of Blackmoor.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Tess.c2.p4"><s sid="11" id="Tess.c2.s11">The district is of historic, no less than of topographical interest.</s> <s sid="12" id="Tess.c2.s12">The Vale was known in former times as the Forest of White Hart, from a curious legend of King Henry III's reign, in which the killing by a certain Thomas de la Lynd of a beautiful white hart which the king had run down and spared, was made the occasion of a heavy fine.</s> <s sid="13" id="Tess.c2.s13">In those days, and till comparatively recent times, the country was densely wooded.</s> <s sid="14" id="Tess.c2.s14">Even now, traces of its earlier condition are to be found in the old oak copses and irregular belts of timber that yet survive upon its slopes, and the hollow-trunked trees that shade so many of its pastures.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Tess.c2.p5" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="Tess.c2.s15">The forests have departed, but some old customs of their shades remain.</s> <s sid="16" id="Tess.c2.s16">Many, however, linger only in a metamorphosed or disguised form.</s> <s sid="17" id="Tess.c2.s17">The May-Day dance, for instance, was to be discerned on the afternoon under notice, in the guise of the club revel, or <qs/>"club-walking,"<qe/> as it was there called.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Tess.c2.p6"><s sid="18" id="Tess.c2.s18">It was an interesting event to the younger inhabitants of Marlott, though its real interest was not observed by the participators in the ceremony.</s> <s sid="19" id="Tess.c2.s19">Its singularity lay less in the retention of a custom of walking in procession and dancing on each anniversary than in the members being solely women.</s> <s sid="20" id="Tess.c2.s20">In men's clubs such celebrations were, though expiring, less uncommon; but either the natural shyness of the softer sex, or a sarcastic attitude on the part of male relatives, had denuded such women's clubs as remained (if any other did) or this their glory and consummation.</s> <s sid="21" id="Tess.c2.s21">The club of Marlott alone lived to uphold the local Cerealia.</s> <s sid="22" id="Tess.c2.s22">It had walked for hundreds of years, if not as benefit-club, as votive sisterhood of some sort; and it walked still.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Tess.c5.p16"><s sid="38" id="Tess.c5.s38">In those early days she had been much loved by others of her own sex and age, and had used to be seen about the village as one of three--all nearly of the same year--walking home from school side by side; Tess the middle one--in a pink print pinafore, of a finely reticulated pattern, worn over a stuff frock that had lost its original colour for a nondescript tertiary--marching on upon long stalky legs, in tight stockings which had little ladder-like holes at the knees, torn by kneeling in the roads and banks in search of vegetable and mineral treasures; her then earth-coloured hair hanging like pot-hooks; the arms of the two outside girls resting round the waist of Tess; her arms on the shoulders of the two supporters.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="Tess.c5.p19"><s sid="43" id="Tess.c5.s43">Every day seemed to throw upon her young shoulders more of the family burdens, and that Tess should be the representative of the Durbeyfields at the d'Urberville mansion came as a thing of course.</s> <s sid="44" id="Tess.c5.s44">In this instance it must be admitted that the Durbeyfields were putting their fairest side outward.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="Tess.c5.p22"><s sid="53" id="Tess.c5.s53">Everything on this snug property was bright, thriving, and well kept; acres of glass-houses stretched down the inclines to the copses at their feet.</s> <s sid="54" id="Tess.c5.s54">Everything looked like money--like the last coin issued from the Mint.</s> <s sid="55" id="Tess.c5.s55">The stables, partly screened by Austrian pines and evergreen oaks, and fitted with every late appliance, were as dignified as Chapels-of-Ease.</s> <s sid="56" id="Tess.c5.s56">On the extensive lawn stood an ornamental tent, its door being towards her.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="Tess.c5.p27"><s sid="67" id="Tess.c5.s67">Of this work of imagination poor Tess and her parents were naturally in ignorance--much to their discomfiture; indeed, the very possibility of such annexations was unknown to them; who supposed that, though to be well-favoured might be the gift of fortune, a family name came by nature.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="Tess.c5.p28"><s sid="68" id="Tess.c5.s68">Tess still stood hesitating like a bather about to make his plunge, hardly knowing whether to retreat or to persevere, when a figure came forth from the dark triangular door of the tent.</s> <s sid="69" id="Tess.c5.s69">It was that of a tall young man, smoking.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="Tess.c18.p30"><s sid="56" id="Tess.c18.s56">Early association with country solitudes had bred in him an unconquerable, and almost unreasonable, aversion to modern town life, and shut him out from such success as he might have aspired to by following a mundane calling in the impracticability of the spiritual one.</s> <s sid="57" id="Tess.c18.s57">But something had to be done; he had wasted many valuable years; and having an acquaintance who was starting on a thriving life as a Colonial farmer, it occurred to Angel that this might be a lead in the right direction.</s> <s sid="58" id="Tess.c18.s58">Farming, either in the Colonies, America, or at home--farming, at any rate, after becoming well qualified for the business by a careful apprenticeship--that was a vocation which would probably afford an independence without the sacrifice of what he valued even more than a competency--intellectual liberty.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Tess.c41.p2"><s sid="3" id="Tess.c41.s3">After again leaving Marlott, her home, she had got through the spring and summer without any great stress upon her physical powers, the time being mainly spent in rendering light irregular service at dairy-work near Port-Bredy to the west of the Blackmoor Valley, equally remote from her native place and from Talbothays.</s> <s sid="4" id="Tess.c41.s4">She preferred this to living on his allowance.</s> <s sid="5" id="Tess.c41.s5">Mentally she remained in utter stagnation, a condition which the mechanical occupation rather fostered than checked.</s> <s sid="6" id="Tess.c41.s6">Her consciousness was at that other dairy, at that other season, in the presence of the tender lover who had confronted her there--he who, the moment she had grasped him to keep for her own, had disappeared like a shape in a vision.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Tess.c41.p3"><s sid="7" id="Tess.c41.s7">The dairy-work lasted only till the milk began to lessen, for she had not met with a second regular engagement as at Talbothays, but had done duty as a supernumerary only.</s> <s sid="8" id="Tess.c41.s8">However, as harvest was now beginning, she had simply to remove from the pasture to the stubble to find plenty of further occupation, and this continued till harvest was done.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Tess.c41.p4"><s sid="9" id="Tess.c41.s9">Of the five-and-twenty pounds which had remained to her of Clare's allowance, after deducting the other half of the fifty as a contribution to her parents for the trouble and expense to which she had put them, she had as yet spent but little.</s> <s sid="10" id="Tess.c41.s10">But there now followed an unfortunate interval of wet weather, during which she was obliged to fall back upon her sovereigns.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Tess.c41.p6"><s sid="14" id="Tess.c41.s14">She had been compelled to send her mother her address from time to time, but she concealed her circumstances.</s> <s sid="15" id="Tess.c41.s15">When her money had almost gone a letter from her mother reached her.</s> <s sid="16" id="Tess.c41.s16">Joan stated that they were in dreadful difficulty; the autumn rains had gone through the thatch of the house, which required entire renewal; but this could not be done because the previous thatching had never been paid for.</s> <s sid="17" id="Tess.c41.s17">New rafters and a new ceiling upstairs also were required, which, with the previous bill, would amount to a sum of twenty pounds.</s> <s sid="18" id="Tess.c41.s18">As her husband was a man of means, and had doubtless returned by this time, could she not send them the money?</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Tess.c41.p14"><s sid="47" id="Tess.c41.s47">She was now on her way to an upland farm in the centre of the county, to which she had been recommended by a wandering letter which had reached her from Marian.</s> <s sid="48" id="Tess.c41.s48">Marian had somehow heard that Tess was separated from her husband--probably through Izz Huett--and the good-natured and now tippling girl, deeming Tess in trouble, had hastened to notify to her former friend that she herself had gone to this upland spot after leaving the dairy, and would like to see her there, where there was room for other hands, if it was really true that she worked again as of old.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Tess.c41.p15"><s sid="49" id="Tess.c41.s49">With the shortening of the days all hope of obtaining her husband's forgiveness began to leave her; and there was something of the habitude of the wild animal in the unreflecting instinct with which she rambled on--disconnecting herself by littles from her eventful past at every step, obliterating her identity, giving no thought to accidents or contingencies which might make a quick discovery of her whereabouts by others of importance to her own happiness, if not to theirs.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Tess.c41.p16"><s sid="50" id="Tess.c41.s50">Among the difficulties of her lonely position not the least was the attention she excited by her appearance, a certain bearing of distinction, which she had caught from Clare, being superadded to her natural attractiveness.</s> <s sid="51" id="Tess.c41.s51">Whilst the clothes lasted which had been prepared for her marriage, these casual glances of interest caused her no inconvenience, but as soon as she was compelled to don the wrapper of a fieldwoman, rude words were addressed to her more than once; but nothing occurred to cause her bodily fear till a particular November afternoon.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Tess.c41.p17"><s sid="52" id="Tess.c41.s52">She had preferred the country west of the River Brit to the upland farm for which she was now bound, because, for one thing, it was nearer to the home of her husband's father; and to hover about that region unrecognized, with the notion that she might decide to call at the Vicarage some day, gave her pleasure.</s> <s sid="53" id="Tess.c41.s53">But having once decided to try the higher and drier levels, she pressed back eastward, marching afoot towards the village of Chalk-Newton, where she meant to pass the night.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="Tess.c43.p1"><s sid="1" id="Tess.c43.s1">There was no exaggeration in Marian's definition of Flintcomb-Ash farm as a starve-acre place.</s> <s sid="2" id="Tess.c43.s2">The single fat thing on the soil was Marian herself; and she was an importation.</s> <s sid="3" id="Tess.c43.s3">Of the three classes of village, the village cared for by its lord, the village cared for by itself, and the village uncared for either by itself or by its lord (in other words, the village of a resident squires's tenantry, the village of free- or copy-holders, and the absentee-owner's village, farmed with the land) this place, Flintcomb-Ash, was the third.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Tess.c43.p2"><s sid="4" id="Tess.c43.s4">But Tess set to work.</s> <s sid="5" id="Tess.c43.s5">Patience, that blending of moral courage with physical timidity, was now no longer a minor feature in Mrs Angel Clare; and it sustained her.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Tess.c43.p3"><s sid="6" id="Tess.c43.s6">The swede-field in which she and her companion were set hacking was a stretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch, on the highest ground of the farm, rising above stony lanchets or lynchets--the outcrop of siliceous veins in the chalk formation, composed of myriads of loose white flints in bulbous, cusped, and phallic shapes.</s> <s sid="7" id="Tess.c43.s7">The upper half of each turnip had been eaten off by the live-stock, and it was the business of the two women to grub up the lower or earthy half of the root with a hooked fork called a hacker, that it might be eaten also.</s> <s sid="8" id="Tess.c43.s8">Every leaf of the vegetable having already been consumed, the whole field was in colour a desolate drab; it was a complexion without features, as if a face, from chin to brow, should be only an expanse of skin.</s> <s sid="9" id="Tess.c43.s9">The sky wore, in another colour, the same likeness; a white vacuity of countenance with the lineaments gone.</s> <s sid="10" id="Tess.c43.s10">So these two upper and nether visages confronted each other all day long, the white face looking down on the brown face, and the brown face looking up at the white face, without anything standing between them but the two girls crawling over the surface of the former like flies.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Tess.c43.p4" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="Tess.c43.s11">Nobody came near them, and their movements showed a mechanical regularity; their forms standing enshrouded in Hessian <qs/>"wroppers"<qe/>-- sleeved brown pinafores, tied behind to the bottom, to keep their gowns from blowing about--scant skirts revealing boots that reached high up the ankles, and yellow sheepskin gloves with gauntlets.</s> <s sid="12" id="Tess.c43.s12">The pensive character which the curtained hood lent to their bent heads would have reminded the observer of some early Italian conception of the two Marys.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Tess.c43.p5"><s sid="13" id="Tess.c43.s13">They worked on hour after hour, unconscious of the forlorn aspect they bore in the landscape, not thinking of the justice or injustice of their lot.</s> <s sid="14" id="Tess.c43.s14">Even in such a position as theirs it was possible to exist in a dream.</s> <s sid="15" id="Tess.c43.s15">In the afternoon the rain came on again, and Marian said that they need not work any more.</s> <s sid="16" id="Tess.c43.s16">But if they did not work they would not be paid; so they worked on.</s> <s sid="17" id="Tess.c43.s17">It was so high a situation, this field, that the rain had no occasion to fall, but raced along horizontally upon the yelling wind, sticking into them like glass splinters till they were wet through.</s> <s sid="18" id="Tess.c43.s18">Tess had not known till now what was really meant by that.</s> <s sid="19" id="Tess.c43.s19">There are degrees of dampness, and a very little is called being wet through in common talk.</s> <s sid="20" id="Tess.c43.s20">But to stand working slowly in a field, and feel the creep of rain-water, first in legs and shoulders, then on hips and head, then at back, front, and sides, and yet to work on till the leaden light diminishes and marks that the sun is down, demands a distinct modicum of stoicism, even of valour.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Tess.c43.p6"><s sid="21" id="Tess.c43.s21">Yet they did not feel the wetness so much as might be supposed.</s> <s sid="22" id="Tess.c43.s22">They were both young, and they were talking of the time when they lived and loved together at Talbothays Dairy, that happy green tract of land where summer had been liberal in her gifts; in substance to all, emotionally to these.</s> <s sid="23" id="Tess.c43.s23">Tess would fain not have conversed with Marian of the man who was legally, if not actually, her husband; but the irresistible fascination of the subject betrayed her into reciprocating Marian's remarks.</s> <s sid="24" id="Tess.c43.s24">And thus, as has been said, though the damp curtains of their bonnets flapped smartly into their faces, and their wrappers clung about them to wearisomeness, they lived all this afternoon in memories of green, sunny, romantic Talbothays.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Tess.c43.p7" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="Tess.c43.s25"><qs/>"You can see a gleam of a hill within a few miles o' Froom Valley from here when 'tis fine,"<qe/> said Marian.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Tess.c43.p8" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="Tess.c43.s26"><qs/>"Ah!</s> <s sid="27" id="Tess.c43.s27">Can you?"<qe/> said Tess, awake to the new value of this locality.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Tess.c43.p9"><s sid="28" id="Tess.c43.s28">So the two forces were at work here as everywhere, the inherent will to enjoy, and the circumstantial will against enjoyment.</s> <s sid="29" id="Tess.c43.s29">Marian's will had a method of assisting itself by taking from her pocket as the afternoon wore on a pint bottle corked with white rag, from which she invited Tess to drink.</s> <s sid="30" id="Tess.c43.s30">Tess's unassisted power of dreaming, however, being enough for her sublimation at present, she declined except the merest sip, and then Marian took a pull from the spirits.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Tess.c43.p10" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="Tess.c43.s31"><qs/>"I've got used to it,"<qe/><sss/> she said, <sse/><qs/>"and can't leave it off now.</s> <s sid="32" id="Tess.c43.s32">'Tis my only comfort--You see I lost him: you didn't; and you can do without it perhaps."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Tess.c43.p11"><s sid="33" id="Tess.c43.s33">Tess thought her loss as great as Marian's, but upheld by the dignity of being Angel's wife, in the letter at least, she accepted Marian's differentiation.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Tess.c43.p12"><s sid="34" id="Tess.c43.s34">Amid this scene Tess slaved in the morning frosts and in the afternoon rains.</s> <s sid="35" id="Tess.c43.s35">When it was not swede-grubbing it was swede-trimming, in which process they sliced off the earth and the fibres with a bill-hook before storing the roots for future use.</s> <s sid="36" id="Tess.c43.s36">At this occupation they could shelter themselves by a thatched hurdle if it rained; but if it was frosty even their thick leather gloves could not prevent the frozen masses they handled from biting their fingers.</s> <s sid="37" id="Tess.c43.s37">Still Tess hoped.</s> <s sid="38" id="Tess.c43.s38">She had a conviction that sooner or later the magnanimity which she persisted in reckoning as a chief ingredient of Clare's character would lead him to rejoin her.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="Tess.c43.p13"><s sid="39" id="Tess.c43.s39">Marian, primed to a humorous mood, would discover the queer-shaped flints aforesaid, and shriek with laughter, Tess remaining severely obtuse.</s> <s sid="40" id="Tess.c43.s40">They often looked across the country to where the Var or Froom was know to stretch, even though they might not be able to see it; and, fixing their eyes on the cloaking gray mist, imagined the old times they had spent out there.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Tess.c43.p14" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="Tess.c43.s41"><qs/>"Ah,"<qe/><sss/> said Marian, <sse/><qs/>"how I should like another or two of our old set to come here!</s> <s sid="42" id="Tess.c43.s42">Then we could bring up Talbothays every day here afield, and talk of he, and of what nice times we had there, and o' the old things we used to know, and make it all come back a'most, in seeming!"<qe/></s> <s sid="43" id="Tess.c43.s43">Marian's eyes softened, and her voice grew vague as the visions returned.</s> <s sid="44" id="Tess.c43.s44"><qs/>"I'll write to Izz Huett,"<qe/> she said.</s> <s sid="45" id="Tess.c43.s45"><qs/>"She's biding at home doing nothing now, I know, and I'll tell her we be here, and ask her to come; and perhaps Retty is well enough now."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Tess.c43.p15"><s sid="46" id="Tess.c43.s46">Tess had nothing to say against the proposal, and the next she heard of this plan for importing old Talbothays' joys was two or three days later, when Marian informed her that Izz had replied to her inquiry, and had promised to come if she could.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Tess.c43.p16"><s sid="47" id="Tess.c43.s47">There had not been such a winter for years.</s> <s sid="48" id="Tess.c43.s48">It came on in stealthy and measured glides, like the moves of a chess-player.</s> <s sid="49" id="Tess.c43.s49">One morning the few lonely trees and the thorns of the hedgerows appeared as if they had put off a vegetable for an animal integument.</s> <s sid="50" id="Tess.c43.s50">Every twig was covered with a white nap as of fur grown from the rind during the night, giving it four times its usual stoutness; the whole bush or tree forming a staring sketch in white lines on the mournful gray of the sky and horizon.</s> <s sid="51" id="Tess.c43.s51">Cobwebs revealed their presence on sheds and walls where none had ever been observed till brought out into visibility by the crystallizing atmosphere, hanging like loops of white worsted from salient points of the out-houses, posts, and gates.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Tess.c43.p17"><s sid="52" id="Tess.c43.s52">After this season of congealed dampness came a spell of dry frost, when strange birds from behind the North Pole began to arrive silently on the upland of Flintcomb-Ash; gaunt spectral creatures with tragical eyes--eyes which had witnessed scenes of cataclysmal horror in inaccessible polar regions of a magnitude such as no human being had ever conceived, in curdling temperatures that no man could endure; which had beheld the crash of icebergs and the slide of snow-hills by the shooting light of the Aurora; been half blinded by the whirl of colossal storms and terraqueous distortions; and retained the expression of feature that such scenes had engendered.</s> <s sid="53" id="Tess.c43.s53">These nameless birds came quite near to Tess and Marian, but of all they had seen which humanity would never see, they brought no account.</s> <s sid="54" id="Tess.c43.s54">The traveller's ambition to tell was not theirs, and, with dumb impassivity, they dismissed experiences which they did not value for the immediate incidents of this homely upland--the trivial movements of the two girls in disturbing the clods with their hackers so as to uncover something or other that these visitants relished as food.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="Tess.c43.p18"><s sid="55" id="Tess.c43.s55">Then one day a peculiar quality invaded the air of this open country.</s> <s sid="56" id="Tess.c43.s56">There came a moisture which was not of rain, and a cold which was not of frost.</s> <s sid="57" id="Tess.c43.s57">It chilled the eyeballs of the twain, made their brows ache, penetrated to their skeletons, affecting the surface of the body less than its core.</s> <s sid="58" id="Tess.c43.s58">They knew that it meant snow, and in the night the snow came.</s> <s sid="59" id="Tess.c43.s59">Tess, who continued to live at the cottage with the warm gable that cheered any lonely pedestrian who paused beside it, awoke in the night, and heard above the thatch noises which seemed to signify that the roof had turned itself into a gymnasium of all the winds.</s> <s sid="60" id="Tess.c43.s60">When she lit her lamp to get up in the morning she found that the snow had blown through a chink in the casement, forming a white cone of the finest powder against the inside, and had also come down the chimney, so that it lay sole-deep upon the floor, on which her shoes left tracks when she moved about.</s> <s sid="61" id="Tess.c43.s61">Without, the storm drove so fast as to create a snow-mist in the kitchen; but as yet it was too dark out-of-doors to see anything.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="Tess.c43.p19"><s sid="62" id="Tess.c43.s62">Tess knew that it was impossible to go on with the swedes; and by the time she had finished breakfast beside the solitary little lamp, Marian arrived to tell her that they were to join the rest of the women at reed-drawing in the barn till the weather changed.</s> <s sid="63" id="Tess.c43.s63">As soon, therefore, as the uniform cloak of darkness without began to turn to a disordered medley of grays, they blew out the lamp, wrapped themselves up in their thickest pinners, tied their woollen cravats round their necks and across their chests, and started for the barn.</s> <s sid="64" id="Tess.c43.s64">The snow had followed the birds from the polar basin as a white pillar of a cloud, and individual flakes could not be seen.</s> <s sid="65" id="Tess.c43.s65">The blast smelt of icebergs, arctic seas, whales, and white bears, carrying the snow so that it licked the land but did not deepen on it.</s> <s sid="66" id="Tess.c43.s66">They trudged onwards with slanted bodies through the flossy fields, keeping as well as they could in the shelter of hedges, which, however, acted as strainers rather than screens.</s> <s sid="67" id="Tess.c43.s67">The air, afflicted to pallor with the hoary multitudes that infested it, twisted and spun them eccentrically, suggesting an achromatic chaos of things.</s> <s sid="68" id="Tess.c43.s68">But both the young women were fairly cheerful; such weather on a dry upland is not in itself dispiriting.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="Tess.c43.p20" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="Tess.c43.s69"><qs/>"Ha-ha! the cunning northern birds knew this was coming,"<qe/> said Marian.</s> <s sid="70" id="Tess.c43.s70"><qs/>"Depend upon't, they keep just in front o't all the way from the North Star.</s> <s sid="71" id="Tess.c43.s71">Your husband, my dear, is, I make no doubt, having scorching weather all this time.</s> <s sid="72" id="Tess.c43.s72">Lord, if he could only see his pretty wife now!</s> <s sid="73" id="Tess.c43.s73">Not that this weather hurts your beauty at all--in fact, it rather does it good."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="Tess.c43.p21" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="Tess.c43.s74"><qs/>"You mustn't talk about him to me, Marian,"<qe/> said Tess severely.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="Tess.c43.p22" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="Tess.c43.s75"><qs/>"Well, but--surely you care for'n!</s> <s sid="76" id="Tess.c43.s76">Do you?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="Tess.c43.p23"><s sid="77" id="Tess.c43.s77">Instead of answering, Tess, with tears in her eyes, impulsively faced in the direction in which she imagined South America to lie, and, putting up her lips, blew out a passionate kiss upon the snowy wind.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="Tess.c43.p24" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="Tess.c43.s78"><qs/>"Well, well, I know you do.</s> <s sid="79" id="Tess.c43.s79">But 'pon my body, it is a rum life for a married couple!</s> <s sid="80" id="Tess.c43.s80">There--I won't say another word!</s> <s sid="81" id="Tess.c43.s81">Well, as for the weather, it won't hurt us in the wheat-barn; but reed-drawing is fearful hard work--worse than swede-hacking.</s> <s sid="82" id="Tess.c43.s82">I can stand it because I'm stout; but you be slimmer than I.</s> <s sid="83" id="Tess.c43.s83">I can't think why maister should have set 'ee at it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="Tess.c43.p25"><s sid="84" id="Tess.c43.s84">They reached the wheat-barn and entered it.</s> <s sid="85" id="Tess.c43.s85">One end of the long structure was full of corn; the middle was where the reed-drawing was carried on, and there had already been placed in the reed-press the evening before as many sheaves of wheat as would be sufficient for the women to draw from during the day.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="Tess.c43.p26" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="Tess.c43.s86"><qs/>"Why, here's Izz!"<qe/> said Marian.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="Tess.c43.p27"><s sid="87" id="Tess.c43.s87">Izz it was, and she came forward.</s> <s sid="88" id="Tess.c43.s88">She had walked all the way from her mother's home on the previous afternoon, and, not deeming the distance so great, had been belated, arriving, however, just before the snow began, and sleeping at the alehouse.</s> <s sid="89" id="Tess.c43.s89">The farmer had agreed with her mother at market to take her on if she came to-day, and she had been afraid to disappoint him by delay.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="Tess.c43.p28"><s sid="90" id="Tess.c43.s90">In addition to Tess, Marian, and Izz, there were two women from a neighbouring village; two Amazonian sisters, whom Tess with a start remembered as Dark Car, the Queen of Spades, and her junior, the Queen of Diamonds--those who had tried to fight with her in the midnight quarrel at Trantridge.</s> <s sid="91" id="Tess.c43.s91">They showed no recognition of her, and possibly had none, for they had been under the influence of liquor on that occasion, and were only temporary sojourners there as here.</s> <s sid="92" id="Tess.c43.s92">They did all kinds of men's work by preference, including well-sinking, hedging, ditching, and excavating, without any sense of fatigue.</s> <s sid="93" id="Tess.c43.s93">Noted reed-drawers were they too, and looked round upon the other three with some superciliousness.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="Tess.c43.p29"><s sid="94" id="Tess.c43.s94">Putting on their gloves, all set to work in a row in front of the press, an erection formed of two posts connected by a cross-beam, under which the sheaves to be drawn from were laid ears outward, the beam being pegged down by pins in the uprights, and lowered as the sheaves diminished.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="Tess.c43.p30"><s sid="95" id="Tess.c43.s95">The day hardened in colour, the light coming in at the barndoors upwards from the snow instead of downwards from the sky.</s> <s sid="96" id="Tess.c43.s96">The girls pulled handful after handful from the press; but by reason of the presence of the strange women, who were recounting scandals, Marian and Izz could not at first talk of old times as they wished to do.</s> <s sid="97" id="Tess.c43.s97">Presently they heard the muffled tread of a horse, and the farmer rode up to the barndoor.</s> <s sid="98" id="Tess.c43.s98">When he had dismounted he came close to Tess, and remained looking musingly at the side of her face.</s> <s sid="99" id="Tess.c43.s99">She had not turned at first, but his fixed attitude led her to look round, when she perceived that her employer was the native of Trantridge from whom she had taken flight on the high-road because of his allusion to her history.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="Tess.c43.p31" type="speech"><s sid="100" id="Tess.c43.s100">He waited till she had carried the drawn bundles to the pile outside, when he said, <qs/>"So you be the young woman who took my civility in such ill part?</s> <s sid="101" id="Tess.c43.s101">Be drowned if I didn't think you might be as soon as I heard of your being hired!</s> <s sid="102" id="Tess.c43.s102">Well, you thought you had got the better of me the first time at the inn with your fancy-man, and the second time on the road, when you bolted; but now I think I've got the better you."<qe/></s> <s sid="103" id="Tess.c43.s103">He concluded with a hard laugh.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="Tess.c43.p32"><s sid="104" id="Tess.c43.s104">Tess, between the Amazons and the farmer, like a bird caught in a clap-net, returned no answer, continuing to pull the straw.</s> <s sid="105" id="Tess.c43.s105">She could read character sufficiently well to know by this time that she had nothing to fear from her employer's gallantry; it was rather the tyranny induced by his mortification at Clare's treatment of him.</s> <s sid="106" id="Tess.c43.s106">Upon the whole she preferred that sentiment in man and felt brave enough to endure it.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="Tess.c59.p1"><s sid="1" id="Tess.c59.s1">The city of Wintoncester, that fine old city, aforetime capital of Wessex, lay amidst its convex and concave downlands in all the brightness and warmth of a July morning.</s> <s sid="2" id="Tess.c59.s2">The gabled brick, tile, and freestone houses had almost dried off for the season their integument of lichen, the streams in the meadows were low, and in the sloping High Street, from the West Gateway to the mediaeval cross, and from the mediaeval cross to the bridge, that leisurely dusting and sweeping was in progress which usually ushers in an old-fashioned market-day.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Tess.c59.p2"><s sid="3" id="Tess.c59.s3">From the western gate aforesaid the highway, as every Wintoncestrian knows, ascends a long and regular incline of the exact length of a measured mile, leaving the houses gradually behind.</s> <s sid="4" id="Tess.c59.s4">Up this road from the precincts of the city two persons were walking rapidly, as if unconscious of the trying ascent--unconscious through preoccupation and not through buoyancy.</s> <s sid="5" id="Tess.c59.s5">They had emerged upon this road through a narrow, barred wicket in a high wall a little lower down.</s> <s sid="6" id="Tess.c59.s6">They seemed anxious to get out of the sight of the houses and of their kind, and this road appeared to offer the quickest means of doing so.</s> <s sid="7" id="Tess.c59.s7">Though they were young, they walked with bowed heads, which gait of grief the sun's rays smiled on pitilessly.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Tess.c59.p3"><s sid="8" id="Tess.c59.s8">One of the pair was Angel Clare, the other a tall budding creature--half girl, half woman--a spiritualized image of Tess, slighter than she, but with the same beautiful eyes--Clare's sister-in-law, 'Liza-Lu.</s> <s sid="9" id="Tess.c59.s9">Their pale faces seemed to have shrunk to half their natural size.</s> <s sid="10" id="Tess.c59.s10">They moved on hand in hand, and never spoke a word, the drooping of their heads being that of Giotto's "Two Apostles".</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Tess.c59.p5"><s sid="14" id="Tess.c59.s14">The prospect from this summit was almost unlimited.</s> <s sid="15" id="Tess.c59.s15">In the valley beneath lay the city they had just left, its more prominent buildings showing as in an isometric drawing--among them the broad cathedral tower, with its Norman windows and immense length of aisle and nave, the spires of St Thomas's, the pinnacled tower of the College, and, more to the right, the tower and gables of the ancient hospice, where to this day the pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale.</s> <s sid="16" id="Tess.c59.s16">Behind the city swept the rotund upland of St Catherine's Hill; further off, landscape beyond landscape, till the horizon was lost in the radiance of the sun hanging above it.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Tess.c59.p6"><s sid="17" id="Tess.c59.s17">Against these far stretches of country rose, in front of the other city edifices, a large red-brick building, with level gray roofs, and rows of short barred windows bespeaking captivity, the whole contrasting greatly by its formalism with the quaint irregularities of the Gothic erections.</s> <s sid="18" id="Tess.c59.s18">It was somewhat disguised from the road in passing it by yews and evergreen oaks, but it was visible enough up here.</s> <s sid="19" id="Tess.c59.s19">The wicket from which the pair had lately emerged was in the wall of this structure.</s> <s sid="20" id="Tess.c59.s20">From the middle of the building an ugly flat-topped octagonal tower ascended against the east horizon, and viewed from this spot, on its shady side and against the light, it seemed the one blot on the city's beauty.</s> <s sid="21" id="Tess.c59.s21">Yet it was with this blot, and not with the beauty, that the two gazers were concerned.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Tess.c59.p7"><s sid="22" id="Tess.c59.s22">Upon the cornice of the tower a tall staff was fixed.</s> <s sid="23" id="Tess.c59.s23">Their eyes were riveted on it.</s> <s sid="24" id="Tess.c59.s24">A few minutes after the hour had struck something moved slowly up the staff, and extended itself upon the breeze.</s> <s sid="25" id="Tess.c59.s25">It was a black flag.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Tess.c59.p8"><s sid="26" id="Tess.c59.s26">"Justice" was done, and the President of the Immortals, in Aeschylean phrase, had ended his sport with Tess.</s> <s sid="27" id="Tess.c59.s27">And the d'Urberville knights and dames slept on in their tombs unknowing.</s> <s sid="28" id="Tess.c59.s28">The two speechless gazers bent themselves down to the earth, as if in prayer, and remained thus a long time, absolutely motionless: the flag continued to wave silently.</s> <s sid="29" id="Tess.c59.s29">As soon as they had strength, they arose, joined hands again, and went on.</s> </p></div>
