<p pid="2" id="mary.c1.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="mary.c1.s3"><qs/>"There's Richard he carries his baby, And Mary takes little Jane, And lovingly they'll be wandering Through fields and briery lane."<qe/></s> <s sid="4" id="mary.c1.s4">--MANCHESTER SONG.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mary.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="mary.c1.s5">There are some fields near Manchester, well known to the inhabitants as <qs/>"Green Heys Fields,"<qe/> through which runs a public footpath to a little village about two miles distant.</s> <s sid="6" id="mary.c1.s6">In spite of these fields being flat, and low, nay, in spite of the want of wood (the great and usual recommendation of level tracts of land), there is a charm about them which strikes even the inhabitant of a mountainous district, who sees and feels the effect of contrast in these commonplace but thoroughly rural fields, with the busy, bustling manufacturing town he left but half-an-hour ago.</s> <s sid="7" id="mary.c1.s7">Here and there an old black and white farmhouse, with its rambling outbuildings, speaks of other times and other occupations than those which now absorb the population of the neighbourhood.</s> <s sid="8" id="mary.c1.s8">Here in their seasons may be seen the country business of haymaking, ploughing, etc., which are such pleasant mysteries for townspeople to watch: and here the artisan, deafened with noise of tongues and engines, may come to listen awhile to the delicious sounds of rural life: the lowing of cattle, the milkmaid's call, the clatter and cackle of poultry in the farmyards.</s> <s sid="9" id="mary.c1.s9">You cannot wonder, then, that these fields are popular places of resort at every holiday time; and you would not wonder, if you could see, or I properly describe, the charm of one particular stile, that it should be, on such occasions, a crowded halting place.</s> <s sid="10" id="mary.c1.s10">Close by it is a deep, clear pond, reflecting in its dark green depths the shadowy trees that bend over it to exclude the sun.</s> <s sid="11" id="mary.c1.s11">The only place where its banks are shelving is on the side next to a rambling farmyard, belonging to one of those old world, gabled, black and white houses I named above, overlooking the field through which the public footpath leads.</s> <s sid="12" id="mary.c1.s12">The porch of this farmhouse is covered by a rose-tree; and the little garden surrounding it is crowded with a medley of old-fashioned herbs and flowers, planted long ago, when the garden was the only druggist's shop within reach, and allowed to grow in scrambling and wild luxuriance--roses, lavender, sage, balm (for tea), rosemary, pinks and wallflowers, onions and jessamine, in most republican and indiscriminate order.</s> <s sid="13" id="mary.c1.s13">This farmhouse and garden are within a hundred yards of the stile of which I spoke, leading from the large pasture field into a smaller one, divided by a hedge of hawthorn and blackthorn; and near this stile, on the further side, there runs a tale that primroses may often be found, and occasionally the blue sweet violet on the grassy hedge bank.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mary.c1.p4"><s sid="14" id="mary.c1.s14">I do not know whether it was on a holiday granted by the masters, or a holiday seized in right of Nature and her beautiful spring time by the workmen, but one afternoon (now ten or a dozen years ago) these fields were much thronged.</s> <s sid="15" id="mary.c1.s15">It was an early May evening--the April of the poets; for heavy showers had fallen all the morning, and the round, soft, white clouds which were blown by a west wind over the dark blue sky, were sometimes varied by one blacker and more threatening.</s> <s sid="16" id="mary.c1.s16">The softness of the day tempted forth the young green leaves, which almost visibly fluttered into life; and the willows, which that morning had had only a brown reflection in the water below, were now of that tender grey-green which blends so delicately with the spring harmony of colours.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mary.c1.p5"><s sid="17" id="mary.c1.s17">Groups of merry and somewhat loud-talking girls, whose ages might range from twelve to twenty, came by with a buoyant step.</s> <s sid="18" id="mary.c1.s18">They were most of them factory girls, and wore the usual out-of-doors dress of that particular class of maidens; namely, a shawl, which at midday or in fine weather was allowed to be merely a shawl, but towards evening, if the day was chilly, became a sort of Spanish mantilla or Scotch plaid, and was brought over the head and hung loosely down, or was pinned under the chin in no unpicturesque fashion.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mary.c1.p6"><s sid="19" id="mary.c1.s19">Their faces were not remarkable for beauty; indeed, they were below the average, with one or two exceptions; they had dark hair, neatly and classically arranged, dark eyes, but sallow complexions and irregular features.</s> <s sid="20" id="mary.c1.s20">The only thing to strike a passer-by was an acuteness and intelligence of countenance, which has often been noticed in a manufacturing population.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mary.c1.p7"><s sid="21" id="mary.c1.s21">There were also numbers of boys, or rather young men, rambling among these fields, ready to bandy jokes with any one, and particularly ready to enter into conversation with the girls, who, however, held themselves aloof, not in a shy, but rather in an independent way, assuming an indifferent manner to the noisy wit or obstreperous compliments of the lads.</s> <s sid="22" id="mary.c1.s22">Here and there came a sober, quiet couple, either whispering lovers, or husband and wife, as the case might be; and if the latter, they were seldom unencumbered by an infant, carried for the most part by the father, while occasionally even three or four little toddlers had been carried or dragged thus far, in order that the whole family might enjoy the delicious May afternoon together.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mary.c1.p8"><s sid="23" id="mary.c1.s23">Some time in the course of that afternoon, two working men met with friendly greeting at the stile so often named.</s> <s sid="24" id="mary.c1.s24">One was a thorough specimen of a Manchester man; born of factory workers, and himself bred up in youth, and living in manhood, among the mills.</s> <s sid="25" id="mary.c1.s25">He was below the middle size and slightly made; there was almost a stunted look about him; and his wan, colourless face gave you the idea, that in his childhood he had suffered from the scanty living consequent upon bad times and improvident habits.</s> <s sid="26" id="mary.c1.s26">His features were strongly marked, though not irregular, and their expression was extreme earnestness; resolute either for good or evil, a sort of latent stern enthusiasm.</s> <s sid="27" id="mary.c1.s27">At the time of which I write, the good predominated over the bad in the countenance, and he was one from whom a stranger would have asked a favour with tolerable faith that it would be granted.</s> <s sid="28" id="mary.c1.s28">He was accompanied by his wife, who might, without exaggeration, have been called a lovely woman, although now her face was swollen with crying, and often hidden behind her apron.</s> <s sid="29" id="mary.c1.s29">She had the fresh beauty of the agricultural districts; and somewhat of the deficiency of sense in her countenance, which is likewise characteristic of the rural inhabitants in comparison with the natives of the manufacturing towns.</s> <s sid="30" id="mary.c1.s30">She was far advanced in pregnancy, which perhaps occasioned the overpowering and hysterical nature of her grief.</s> <s sid="31" id="mary.c1.s31">The friend whom they met was more handsome and less sensible-looking than the man I have just described; he seemed hearty and hopeful, and although his age was greater, yet there was far more of youth's buoyancy in his appearance.</s> <s sid="32" id="mary.c1.s32">He was tenderly carrying a baby in arms, while his wife, a delicate, fragile-looking woman, limping in her gait, bore another of the same age; little, feeble twins, inheriting the frail appearance of their mother.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mary.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="mary.c1.s33">The last-mentioned man was the first to speak, while a sudden look of sympathy dimmed his gladsome face.</s> <s sid="34" id="mary.c1.s34"><qs/>"Well, John, how goes it with you?"<qe/><sls/> and in a lower voice, he added, <sle/><qs/>"Any news of Esther yet?"<qe/></s> <s sid="35" id="mary.c1.s35">Meanwhile the wives greeted each other like old friends, the soft and plaintive voice of the mother of the twins seeming to call forth only fresh sobs from Mrs. Barton.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mary.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="mary.c1.s36"><qs/>"Come, women,"<qe/><sss/> said John Barton, <sse/><qs/>"you've both walked far enough.</s> <s sid="37" id="mary.c1.s37">My Mary expects to have her bed in three weeks; and as for you, Mrs. Wilson, you know you are but a cranky sort of a body at the best of times."<qe/></s> <s sid="38" id="mary.c1.s38">This was said so kindly, that no offence could be taken.</s> <s sid="39" id="mary.c1.s39"><qs/>"Sit you down here; the grass is well nigh dry by this time; and you're neither of you nesh folk about taking cold.</s> <s sid="40" id="mary.c1.s40">Stay,"<qe/><sls/> he added, with some tenderness, <sle/><qs/>"here's my pocket-handkerchief to spread under you to save the gowns women always think so much on; and now, Mrs. Wilson, give me the baby, I may as well carry him, while you talk and comfort my wife; poor thing, she takes on sadly about Esther."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mary.c1.p11"><s sid="41" id="mary.c1.s41">These arrangements were soon completed; the two women sat down on the blue cotton handkerchiefs of their husbands, and the latter, each carrying a baby, set off for a further walk; but as soon as Barton had turned his back upon his wife, his countenance fell back into an expression of gloom.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mary.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="mary.c1.s42"><qs/>"Then you've heard nothing of Esther, poor lass?"<qe/> asked Wilson.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mary.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="mary.c1.s43"><qs/>"No, nor shan't, as I take it.</s> <s sid="44" id="mary.c1.s44">My mind is, she's gone off with somebody.</s> <s sid="45" id="mary.c1.s45">My wife frets and thinks she's drowned herself, but I tell her, folks don't care to put on their best clothes to drown themselves; and Mrs. Bradshaw (where she lodged, you know) says the last time she set eyes on her was last Tuesday, when she came downstairs, dressed in her Sunday gown, and with a new ribbon in her bonnet, and gloves on her hands, like the lady she was so fond of thinking herself."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mary.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="mary.c1.s46"><qs/>"She was as pretty a creature as ever the sun shone on."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mary.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="mary.c1.s47"><qs/>"Ay, she was a farrantly lass; more's the pity now,"<qe/> added Barton, with a sigh.</s> <s sid="48" id="mary.c1.s48"><qs/>"You see them Buckinghamshire people as comes to work here has quite a different look with them to us Manchester folk.</s> <s sid="49" id="mary.c1.s49">You'll not see among the Manchester wenches such fresh rosy cheeks, or such black lashes to grey eyes (making them look like black), as my wife and Esther had.</s> <s sid="50" id="mary.c1.s50">I never seed two such pretty women for sisters; never.</s> <s sid="51" id="mary.c1.s51">Not but what beauty is a sad snare.</s> <s sid="52" id="mary.c1.s52">Here was Esther so puffed up, that there was no holding her in.</s> <s sid="53" id="mary.c1.s53">Her spirit was always up, if I spoke ever so little in the way of advice to her; my wife spoiled her, it is true, for you see she was so much older than Esther, she was more like a mother to her, doing everything for her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mary.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="mary.c1.s54"><qs/>"I wonder she ever left you,"<qe/> observed his friend.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mary.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="mary.c1.s55"><qs/>"That's the worst of factory work for girls.</s> <s sid="56" id="mary.c1.s56">They can earn so much when work is plenty, that they can maintain themselves anyhow.</s> <s sid="57" id="mary.c1.s57">My Mary shall never work in a factory, that I'm determined on.</s> <s sid="58" id="mary.c1.s58">You see Esther spent her money in dress, thinking to set off her pretty face; and got to come home so late at night, that at last I told her my mind; my missis thinks I spoke crossly, but I meant right, for I loved Esther, if it was only for Mary's sake.</s> <s sid="59" id="mary.c1.s59">Says I, <alt-qs/>'Esther, I see what you'll end at with your artificials, and your fly-away veils, and stopping out when honest women are in their beds: you'll be a street-walker, Esther, and then, don't you go to think I'll have you darken my door, though my wife is your sister?'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="60" id="mary.c1.s60">So says she, <alt-qs/>'Don't trouble yourself, John, I'll pack up and be off now, for I'll never stay to hear myself called as you call me.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="61" id="mary.c1.s61">She flushed up like a turkey-cock, and I thought fire would come out of her eyes; but when she saw Mary cry (for Mary can't abide words in a house), she went and kissed her, and said she was not so bad as I thought her.</s> <s sid="62" id="mary.c1.s62">So we talked more friendly, for, as I said, I liked the lass well enough, and her pretty looks, and her cheery ways.</s> <s sid="63" id="mary.c1.s63">But she said (and at that time I thought there was sense in what she said) we should be much better friends if she went into lodgings, and only came to see us now and then."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mary.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="mary.c1.s64"><qs/>"Then you still were friendly.</s> <s sid="65" id="mary.c1.s65">Folks said you'd cast her off, and said you'd never speak to her again."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mary.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="mary.c1.s66"><qs/>"Folks always make one a deal worse than one is,"<qe/> said John Barton testily.</s> <s sid="67" id="mary.c1.s67"><qs/>"She came many a time to our house after she left off living with us.</s> <s sid="68" id="mary.c1.s68">Last Sunday se'nnight--no! it was this very last Sunday, she came to drink a cup of tea with Mary; and that was the last time we set eyes on her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mary.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="mary.c1.s69"><qs/>"Was she any ways different in her manner?"<qe/> asked Wilson.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mary.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="mary.c1.s70"><qs/>"Well, I don't know.</s> <s sid="71" id="mary.c1.s71">I have thought several times since, that she was a bit quieter, and more womanly-like; more gentle, and more blushing, and not so riotous and noisy.</s> <s sid="72" id="mary.c1.s72">She comes in towards four o'clock, when afternoon church was loosing, and she goes and hangs her bonnet up on the old nail we used to call hers, while she lived with us.</s> <s sid="73" id="mary.c1.s73">I remember thinking what a pretty lass she was, as she sat on a low stool by Mary, who was rocking herself, and in rather a poor way.</s> <s sid="74" id="mary.c1.s74">She laughed and cried by turns, but all so softly and gently, like a child, that I couldn't find in my heart to scold her, especially as Mary was fretting already.</s> <s sid="75" id="mary.c1.s75">One thing I do remember I did say, and pretty sharply too.</s> <s sid="76" id="mary.c1.s76">She took our little Mary by the waist and"<qe/>--</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mary.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="mary.c1.s77"><qs/>"Thou must leave off calling her 'little' Mary, she's growing up into as fine a lass as one can see on a summer's day; more of her mother's stock than thine,"<qe/> interrupted Wilson.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mary.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="mary.c1.s78"><qs/>"Well, well, I call her <alt-qs/>'little' because her mother's name is Mary.</s> <s sid="79" id="mary.c1.s79">But, as I was saying, she takes Mary in a coaxing sort of way, and 'Mary,'<alt-qe/><sss/> says she, <sse/><alt-qs/>'what should you think if I sent for you some day and made a lady of you?'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="80" id="mary.c1.s80">So I could not stand such talk as that to my girl, and I said, 'Thou'd best not put that nonsense i' the girl's head I can tell thee; I'd rather see her earning her bread by the sweat of brow, as the Bible tells her she should do, ay, though she never got butter to her bread, than be like a do-nothing lady, worrying shopmen all morning, and screeching at her pianny all afternoon, and going to bed without having done a good turn to any one of God's creatures but herself.'"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mary.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="mary.c1.s81"><qs/>"Thou never could abide the gentlefolk,"<qe/> said Wilson, half amused at his friend's vehemence.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="mary.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="mary.c1.s82"><qs/>"And what good have they ever done me that I should like them?"<qe/><sls/> asked Barton, the latent fire lighting up his eye: and bursting forth he continued, <sle/><qs/>"If I am sick do they come and nurse me?</s> <s sid="83" id="mary.c1.s83">If my child lies dying (as poor Tom lay, with his white wan lips quivering, for want of better food than I could give him), does the rich man bring the wine or broth that might save his life?</s> <s sid="84" id="mary.c1.s84">If I am out of work for weeks in the bad times, and winter comes, with black frost, and keen east wind, and there is no coal for the grate, and no clothes for the bed, and the thin bones are seen through the ragged clothes, does the rich man share his plenty with me, as he ought to do, if his religion wasn't a humbug?</s> <s sid="85" id="mary.c1.s85">When I lie on my death-bed and Mary (bless her!) stands fretting, as I know she will fret,"<qe/><sls/> and here his voice faltered a little, <sle/><qs/>"will a rich lady come and take her to her own home if need be, till she can look round, and see what best to do?</s> <s sid="86" id="mary.c1.s86">No, I tell you it's the poor, and the poor only, as does such things for the poor.</s> <s sid="87" id="mary.c1.s87">Don't think to come over me with th' old tale, that the rich know nothing of the trials of the poor; I say, if they don't know, they ought to know.</s> <s sid="88" id="mary.c1.s88">We're their slaves as long as we can work; we pile up their fortunes with the sweat of our brows, and yet we are to live as separate as if we were in two worlds; ay, as separate as Dives and Lazarus, with a great gulf betwixt us: but I know who was best off then,"<qe/> and he wound up his speech with a low chuckle that had no mirth in it.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="mary.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="mary.c1.s89"><qs/>"Well, neighbour,"<qe/><sss/> said Wilson, <sse/><qs/>"all that may be very true, but what I want to know now is about Esther--when did you last hear of her?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="mary.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="mary.c1.s90"><qs/>"Why, she took leave of us that Sunday night in a very loving way, kissing both wife Mary, and daughter Mary (if I must not call her 'little'), and shaking hands with me; but all in a cheerful sort of manner, so we thought nothing about her kisses and shakes.</s> <s sid="91" id="mary.c1.s91">But on Wednesday night comes Mrs. Bradshaw's son  with Esther's box, and presently Mrs. Bradshaw follows with the key; and when we began to talk, we found Esther told her she was coming back to live with us, and would pay her week's money for not giving notice; and on Tuesday night she carried off a little bundle (her best clothes were on her back, as I said before) and told Mrs. Bradshaw not to hurry herself about the big box, but bring it when she had time.</s> <s sid="92" id="mary.c1.s92">So, of course, she thought she should find Esther with us; and when she told her story, my missis set up such a screech, and fell down in a dead swoon.</s> <s sid="93" id="mary.c1.s93">Mary ran up with water for her mother, and I thought so much about my wife, I did not seem to care at all for Esther.</s> <s sid="94" id="mary.c1.s94">But the next day I asked all the neighbours (both our own and Bradshaw's) and they'd none of 'em heard or seen nothing of her.</s> <s sid="95" id="mary.c1.s95">I even went to a policeman, a good enough sort of man, but a fellow I'd never spoken to before because of his livery, and I asks him if his 'cuteness could find anything out for us.</s> <s sid="96" id="mary.c1.s96">So I believe he asks other policemen; and one on 'em had seen a wench, like our Esther, walking very quickly, with a bundle under her arm, on Tuesday night, toward eight o'clock, and get into a hackney coach, near Hulme Church, and we don't know th' number, and can't trace it no further.</s> <s sid="97" id="mary.c1.s97">I'm sorry enough for the girl, for bad's come over her, one way or another, but I'm sorrier for my wife.</s> <s sid="98" id="mary.c1.s98">She loved her next to me and Mary, and she's never been the same body since poor Tom's death.</s> <s sid="99" id="mary.c1.s99">However, let's go back to them; your old woman may have done her good."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="mary.c1.p28"><s sid="100" id="mary.c1.s100">As they walked homewards with a brisker pace, Wilson expressed a wish that they still were the near neighbours they once had been.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="mary.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="101" id="mary.c1.s101"><qs/>"Still our Alice lives in the cellar under No. 14, in Barber Street, and if you'd only speak the word she'd be with you in five minutes to keep your wife company when she's lonesome.</s> <s sid="102" id="mary.c1.s102">Though I'm Alice's brother, and perhaps ought not to say it, I will say there's none more ready to help with heart or hand than she is.</s> <s sid="103" id="mary.c1.s103">Though she may have done a hard day's wash, there's not a child ill within the street, but Alice goes to offer to sit up, and does sit up, too, though may be she's to be at her work by six next morning."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="mary.c1.p30" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="mary.c1.s104"><qs/>"She's a poor woman, and can feel for the poor, Wilson,"<qe/><sls/> was Barton's reply; and then he added, <sle/><qs/>"Thank you kindly for your offer, and mayhap I may trouble her to be a bit with my wife, for while I'm at work, and Mary's at school, I know she frets above a bit.</s> <s sid="105" id="mary.c1.s105">See, there's Mary!"<qe/> and the father's eye brightened, as in the distance, among a group of girls, he spied his only daughter, a bonny lass of thirteen or so, who came bounding along to meet and to greet her father, in a manner that showed that the stern-looking man had a tender nature within.</s> <s sid="106" id="mary.c1.s106">The two men had crossed the last stile, while Mary loitered behind to gather some buds of the coming hawthorn, when an overgrown lad came past her, and snatched a kiss, exclaiming, <qs/>"For old acquaintance sake, Mary."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="mary.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="107" id="mary.c1.s107"><qs/>"Take that for old acquaintance sake, then,"<qe/> said the girl, blushing rosy red, more with anger than shame, as she slapped his face.</s> <s sid="108" id="mary.c1.s108">The tones of her voice called back her father and his friend, and the aggressor proved to be the eldest son of the latter, the senior by eighteen years of his little brothers.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mary.c2.p10"><s sid="19" id="mary.c2.s19">Mrs. Barton produced the key of the door from her pocket; and on entering the house-place it seemed as if they were in total darkness, except one bright spot, which might be a cat's eye, or might be, what it was, a red-hot fire, smouldering under a large piece of coal, which John Barton immediately applied himself to break up, and the effect instantly produced was warm and glowing light in every corner of the room.</s> <s sid="20" id="mary.c2.s20">To add to this (although the coarse yellow glare seemed lost in the ruddy glow from the fire), Mrs. Barton lighted a dip by sticking it in the fire, and having placed it satisfactorily in a tin candlestick, began to look further about her, on hospitable thoughts intent.</s> <s sid="21" id="mary.c2.s21">The room was tolerably large, and possessed many conveniences.</s> <s sid="22" id="mary.c2.s22">On the right of the door, as you entered, was a longish window, with a broad ledge.</s> <s sid="23" id="mary.c2.s23">On each side of this, hung blue-and-white check curtains, which were now drawn, to shut in the friends met to enjoy themselves.</s> <s sid="24" id="mary.c2.s24">Two geraniums, unpruned and leafy, which stood on the sill, formed a further defence from out-door pryers.</s> <s sid="25" id="mary.c2.s25">In the corner between the window and the fireside was a cupboard, apparently full of plates and dishes, cups and saucers, and some more nondescript articles, for which one would have fancied their possessors could find no use-- such as triangular pieces of glass to save carving knives and forks from dirtying table-cloths.</s> <s sid="26" id="mary.c2.s26">However, it was evident Mrs. Barton was proud of her crockery and glass, for she left her cupboard door open, with a glance round of satisfaction and pleasure.</s> <s sid="27" id="mary.c2.s27">On the opposite side to the door and window was the staircase, and two doors; one of which (the nearest to the fire) led into a sort of little back kitchen, where dirty work, such as washing up dishes, might be done, and whose shelves served as larder, and pantry, and storeroom, and all.</s> <s sid="28" id="mary.c2.s28">The other door, which was considerably lower, opened into the coal-hole--the slanting closet under the stairs; from which, to the fire-place, there was a gay-coloured piece of oil-cloth laid.</s> <s sid="29" id="mary.c2.s29">The place seemed almost crammed with furniture (sure sign of good times among the mills).</s> <s sid="30" id="mary.c2.s30">Beneath the window was a dresser, with three deep drawers.</s> <s sid="31" id="mary.c2.s31">Opposite the fire-place was a table, which I should call a Pembroke, only that it was made of deal, and I cannot tell how far such a name may be applied to such humble material.</s> <s sid="32" id="mary.c2.s32">On it, resting against the wall, was a bright green japanned tea-tray, having a couple of scarlet lovers embracing in the middle.</s> <s sid="33" id="mary.c2.s33">The fire-light danced merrily on this, and really (setting all taste but that of a child's aside) it gave a richness of colouring to that side of the room.</s> <s sid="34" id="mary.c2.s34">It was in some measure propped up by a crimson tea-caddy, also of japan ware.</s> <s sid="35" id="mary.c2.s35">A round table on one branching leg, really for use, stood in the corresponding corner to the cupboard; and, if you can picture all this, with a washy, but clean stencilled pattern on the walls, you can form some idea of John Barton's home.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mary.c2.p11"><s sid="36" id="mary.c2.s36">The tray was soon hoisted down, and before the merry clatter of cups and saucers began, the women disburdened themselves of their out-of-door things, and sent Mary upstairs with them.</s> <s sid="37" id="mary.c2.s37">Then came a long whispering, and chinking of money, to which Mr. and Mrs. Wilson were too polite to attend; knowing, as they did full well, that it all related to the preparations for hospitality; hospitality that, in their turn, they should have such pleasure in offering.</s> <s sid="38" id="mary.c2.s38">So they tried to be busily occupied with the children, and not to hear Mrs. Barton's directions to Mary.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="mary.c21.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="mary.c21.s1"><qs/>"My rest is gone, My heart is sore, Peace find I never, And never more."<qe/></s> <s sid="2" id="mary.c21.s2">--MARGARET'S SONG IN <qs/>"FAUST."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mary.c21.p2"><s sid="3" id="mary.c21.s3">I must go back a little to explain the motives which caused Esther to seek an interview with her niece.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mary.c21.p3"><s sid="4" id="mary.c21.s4">The murder had been committed early on Thursday night, and between then and the dawn of the following day there was ample time for the news to spread far and wide among all those whose duty, or whose want, or whose errors, caused them to be abroad in the streets of Manchester.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mary.c21.p4"><s sid="5" id="mary.c21.s5">Among those who listened to the tale of violence was Esther.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mary.c21.p5"><s sid="6" id="mary.c21.s6">A craving desire to know more took possession of her mind.</s> <s sid="7" id="mary.c21.s7">Far away as she was from Turner Street, she immediately set off to the scene of the murder, which was faintly lighted by the grey dawn as she reached the spot.</s> <s sid="8" id="mary.c21.s8">It was so quiet and still that she could hardly believe it to be the place.</s> <s sid="9" id="mary.c21.s9">The only vestige of any scuffle or violence was a trail on the dust, as if somebody had been lying there, and then been raised by extraneous force.</s> <s sid="10" id="mary.c21.s10">The little birds were beginning to hop and twitter in the leafless hedge, making the only sound that was near and distinct.</s> <s sid="11" id="mary.c21.s11">She crossed into the field where she guessed the murderer to have stood; it was easy of access, for the worn, stunted hawthorn-hedge had many gaps in it.</s> <s sid="12" id="mary.c21.s12">The night-smell of bruised grass came up from under her feet, as she went towards the saw-pit and carpenter's shed which, as I have said before, were in a corner of the field near the road, and where one of her informants had told her it was supposed by the police that the murderer had lurked while waiting for his victim.</s> <s sid="13" id="mary.c21.s13">There was no sign, however, that any one had been about the place.</s> <s sid="14" id="mary.c21.s14">If the grass had been bruised or bent where he had trod, it had had enough of the elasticity of life to raise itself under the dewy influences of night.</s> <s sid="15" id="mary.c21.s15">She hushed her breath in involuntary awe, but nothing else told of the violent deed by which a fellow-creature had passed away.</s> <s sid="16" id="mary.c21.s16">She stood still for a minute, imagining to herself the position of the parties, guided by the only circumstance which afforded any evidence, the trailing mark on the dust in the road.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mary.c21.p6"><s sid="17" id="mary.c21.s17">Suddenly (it was before the sun had risen above the horizon) she became aware of something white in the hedge.</s> <s sid="18" id="mary.c21.s18">All other colours wore the same murky hue, though the forms of objects were perfectly distinct.</s> <s sid="19" id="mary.c21.s19">What was it?</s> <s sid="20" id="mary.c21.s20">It could not be a flower;--that, the time of year made clear.</s> <s sid="21" id="mary.c21.s21">A frozen lump of snow, lingering late in one of the gnarled tufts of the hedge?</s> <s sid="22" id="mary.c21.s22">She stepped forward to examine.</s> <s sid="23" id="mary.c21.s23">It proved to be a little piece of stiff writing-paper compressed into a round shape.</s> <s sid="24" id="mary.c21.s24">She understood it instantly; it was the paper that had served as wadding for the murderer's gun.</s> <s sid="25" id="mary.c21.s25">Then she had been standing just where the murderer must have been but a few hours before; probably (as the rumour had spread through the town, reaching her ears) one of the poor maddened turn-outs, who hung about everywhere, with black, fierce looks, as if contemplating some deed of violence.</s> <s sid="26" id="mary.c21.s26">Her sympathy was all with them, for she had known what they suffered; and besides this, there was her own individual dislike of Mr. Carson, and dread of him for Mary's sake.</s> <s sid="27" id="mary.c21.s27">Yet, poor Mary!</s> <s sid="28" id="mary.c21.s28">Death was a terrible, though sure, remedy for the evil Esther had dreaded for her; and how would she stand the shock, loving as her aunt believed her to do?</s> <s sid="29" id="mary.c21.s29">Poor Mary! who would comfort her?</s> <s sid="30" id="mary.c21.s30">Esther's thoughts began to picture her sorrow, her despair, when the news of her lover's death should reach her; and she longed to tell her there might have been a keener grief yet had he lived.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mary.c21.p7"><s sid="31" id="mary.c21.s31">Bright, beautiful came the slanting rays of the morning sun.</s> <s sid="32" id="mary.c21.s32">It was time for such as she to hide themselves, with the other obscene things of night, from the glorious light of day, which was only for the happy.</s> <s sid="33" id="mary.c21.s33">So she turned her steps towards town, still holding the paper.</s> <s sid="34" id="mary.c21.s34">But in getting over the hedge it encumbered her to hold it in her clasped hand, and she threw it down.</s> <s sid="35" id="mary.c21.s35">She passed on a few steps, her thoughts still of Mary, till the idea crossed her mind, could it (blank as it appeared to be) give any clue to the murderer?</s> <s sid="36" id="mary.c21.s36">As I said before, her sympathies were all on that side, so she turned back and picked it up; and then feeling as if in some measure an accessory, she hid it unexamined in her hand, and hastily passed out of the street at the opposite end to that by which she had entered it.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mary.c21.p8"><s sid="37" id="mary.c21.s37">And what do you think she felt, when having walked some distance from the spot, she dared to open the crushed paper, and saw written on it Mary Barton's name, and not only that, but the street in which she lived!</s> <s sid="38" id="mary.c21.s38">True, a letter or two was torn off, but, nevertheless, there was the name clear to be recognised.</s> <s sid="39" id="mary.c21.s39">And oh! what terrible thought flashed into her mind; or was it only fancy?</s> <s sid="40" id="mary.c21.s40">But it looked very like the writing which she had once known well--the writing of Jem Wilson, who, when she lived at her brother-in-law's, and he was a near neighbour, had often been employed by her to write her letters to people, to whom she was ashamed of sending her own misspelt scrawl.</s> <s sid="41" id="mary.c21.s41">She remembered the wonderful flourishes she had so much admired in those days, while she sat by dictating, and Jem, in all the pride of newly-acquired penmanship, used to dazzle her eyes by extraordinary graces and twirls.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mary.c21.p9"><s sid="42" id="mary.c21.s42">If it were his!</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mary.c21.p10"><s sid="43" id="mary.c21.s43">Oh! perhaps it was merely that her head was running so on Mary, that she was associating every trifle with her.</s> <s sid="44" id="mary.c21.s44">As if only one person wrote in that flourishing, meandering style!</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mary.c21.p11"><s sid="45" id="mary.c21.s45">It was enough to fill her mind to think from what she might have saved Mary by securing the paper.</s> <s sid="46" id="mary.c21.s46">She would look at it just once more, and see if some very dense and stupid policeman could have mistaken the name, or if Mary would certainly have been dragged into notice in the affair.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mary.c21.p12" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="mary.c21.s47">No! no one could have mistaken the <qs/>"ry Barton,"<qe/> and it WAS Jem's handwriting!</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mary.c21.p13"><s sid="48" id="mary.c21.s48">Oh! if it was so, she understood it all, and she had been the cause!</s> <s sid="49" id="mary.c21.s49">With her violent and unregulated nature, rendered morbid by the course of life she led, and her consciousness of her degradation, she cursed herself for the interference which she believed had led to this; for the information and the warning she had given to Jem, which had roused him to this murderous action.</s> <s sid="50" id="mary.c21.s50">How could she, the abandoned and polluted outcast, ever have dared to hope for a blessing, even on her efforts to do good.</s> <s sid="51" id="mary.c21.s51">The black curse of Heaven rested on all her doings, were they for good or for evil.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mary.c21.p14"><s sid="52" id="mary.c21.s52">Poor, diseased mind! and there were none to minister to thee!</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mary.c21.p15"><s sid="53" id="mary.c21.s53">So she wandered about, too restless to take her usual heavy morning's sleep, up and down the streets, greedily listening to every word of the passers-by, and loitering near each group of talkers, anxious to scrape together every morsel of information, or conjecture, or suspicion, though without possessing any definite purpose in all this.</s> <s sid="54" id="mary.c21.s54">And ever and always she clenched the scrap of paper which might betray so much, until her nails had deeply indented the palm of her hand; so fearful was she in her nervous dread, lest unawares she should let it drop.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mary.c21.p16"><s sid="55" id="mary.c21.s55">Towards the middle of the day she could no longer evade the body's craving want of rest and refreshment; but the rest was taken in a spirit vault, and the refreshment was a glass of gin.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mary.c21.p17"><s sid="56" id="mary.c21.s56">Then she started up from the stupor she had taken for repose; and suddenly driven before the gusty impulses of her mind, she pushed her way to the place where at that very time the police were bringing the information they had gathered with regard to the all-engrossing murder.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mary.c21.p18"><s sid="57" id="mary.c21.s57">She listened with painful acuteness of comprehension to dropped words, and unconnected sentences, the meaning of which became clearer, and yet more clear to her.</s> <s sid="58" id="mary.c21.s58">Jem was suspected.</s> <s sid="59" id="mary.c21.s59">Jem was ascertained to be the murderer.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mary.c21.p19"><s sid="60" id="mary.c21.s60">She saw him (although he, absorbed in deep sad thought, saw her not), she saw him brought handcuffed and guarded out of the coach.</s> <s sid="61" id="mary.c21.s61">She saw him enter the station--she gasped for breath till he came out, still handcuffed, and still guarded, to be conveyed to the New Bailey.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mary.c21.p20"><s sid="62" id="mary.c21.s62">He was the only one who had spoken to her with hope that she might win her way back to virtue.</s> <s sid="63" id="mary.c21.s63">His words had lingered in her heart with a sort of call to heaven, like distant Sabbath bells, although in her despair she had turned away from his voice.</s> <s sid="64" id="mary.c21.s64">He was the only one who had spoken to her kindly.</s> <s sid="65" id="mary.c21.s65">The murder, shocking though it was, was an absent, abstract thing, on which her thoughts could not, and would not dwell: all that was present in her mind was Jem's danger, and his kindness.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mary.c21.p21"><s sid="66" id="mary.c21.s66">Then Mary came to remembrance.</s> <s sid="67" id="mary.c21.s67">Esther wondered till she was sick of wondering, in what way she was taking the affair.</s> <s sid="68" id="mary.c21.s68">In some manner it would be a terrible blow for the poor, motherless girl; with her dreadful father, too, who was to Esther a sort of accusing angel.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mary.c21.p22"><s sid="69" id="mary.c21.s69">She set off towards the court where Mary lived, to pick up what she could there of information.</s> <s sid="70" id="mary.c21.s70">But she was ashamed to enter in where once she had been innocent, and hung about the neighbouring streets, not daring to question, so she learnt but little; nothing, in fact, but the knowledge of John Barton's absence from home.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mary.c21.p23"><s sid="71" id="mary.c21.s71">She went up a dark entry to rest her weary limbs on a doorstep and think.</s> <s sid="72" id="mary.c21.s72">Her elbows on her knees, her face hidden in her hands, she tried to gather together and arrange her thoughts.</s> <s sid="73" id="mary.c21.s73">But still every now and then she opened her hand to see if the paper were yet there.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mary.c21.p24"><s sid="74" id="mary.c21.s74">She got up at last.</s> <s sid="75" id="mary.c21.s75">She had formed a plan, and had a course of action to look forward to that would satisfy one craving desire at least.</s> <s sid="76" id="mary.c21.s76">The time was long gone by when there was much wisdom or consistency in her projects.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="mary.c21.p25"><s sid="77" id="mary.c21.s77">It was getting late, and that was so much the better.</s> <s sid="78" id="mary.c21.s78">She went to a pawnshop, and took off her finery in a back room.</s> <s sid="79" id="mary.c21.s79">She was known by the people, and had a character for honesty, so she had no very great difficulty in inducing them to let her have a suit of outer clothes, befitting the wife of a working-man, a black silk bonnet, a printed gown, a plaid shawl, dirty and rather worn to be sure, but which had a sort of sanctity to the eyes of the street-walker as being the appropriate garb of that happy class to which she could never, never more belong.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="mary.c21.p26"><s sid="80" id="mary.c21.s80">She looked at herself in the little glass which hung against the wall, and sadly shaking her head thought how easy were the duties of that Eden of innocence from which she was shut out; how she would work, and toil, and starve, and die, if necessary, for a husband, a home--for children--but that thought she could not bear; a little form rose up, stern in its innocence, from the witches' caldron of her imagination, and she rushed into action again.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="mary.c21.p27"><s sid="81" id="mary.c21.s81">You know now how she came to stand by the threshold of Mary's door, waiting, trembling, until the latch was lifted, and her niece, with words that spoke of such desolation among the living, fell into her arms.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="mary.c21.p28"><s sid="82" id="mary.c21.s82">She had felt as if some holy spell would prevent her (even as the unholy Lady Geraldine was prevented, in the abode of Christabel) from crossing the threshold of that home of her early innocence; and she had meant to wait for an invitation.</s> <s sid="83" id="mary.c21.s83">But Mary's helpless action did away with all reluctant feeling, and she bore or dragged her to her seat, and looked on her bewildered eyes, as, puzzled with the likeness, which was not identity, she gazed on her aunt's features.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="mary.c21.p29"><s sid="84" id="mary.c21.s84">In pursuance of her plan, Esther meant to assume the manners and character, as she had done the dress, of a mechanic's wife; but then, to account for her long absence, and her long silence towards all that ought to have been dear to her, it was necessary that she should put on an indifference far distant from her heart, which was loving and yearning, in spite of all its faults.</s> <s sid="85" id="mary.c21.s85">And, perhaps, she over-acted her part, for certainly Mary felt a kind of repugnance to the changed and altered aunt, who so suddenly reappeared on the scene; and it would have cut Esther to the very core, could she have known how her little darling of former days was feeling towards her.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="mary.c21.p30" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="mary.c21.s86"><qs/>"You don't remember me, I see, Mary!"<qe/> she began.</s> <s sid="87" id="mary.c21.s87"><qs/>"It's a long while since I left you all, to be sure; and I, many a time, thought of coming to see you, and--and your father.</s> <s sid="88" id="mary.c21.s88">But I live so far off, and am always so busy, I cannot do just what I wish.</s> <s sid="89" id="mary.c21.s89">You recollect aunt Esther, don't you, Mary?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="mary.c21.p31" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="mary.c21.s90"><qs/>"Are you Aunt Hetty?"<qe/> asked Mary faintly, still looking at the face which was so different from the old recollections of her aunt's fresh dazzling beauty.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="mary.c21.p32" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="mary.c21.s91"><qs/>"Yes!</s> <s sid="92" id="mary.c21.s92">I am Aunt Hetty.</s> <s sid="93" id="mary.c21.s93">Oh! it's so long since I heard that name,"<qe/> sighing forth the thoughts it suggested; then, recovering herself, and striving after the hard character she wished to assume, she continued:</s> <s sid="94" id="mary.c21.s94"><qs/>"And to-day I heard a friend of yours, and of mine too, long ago, was in trouble, and I guessed you would be in sorrow, so I thought I would just step this far and see you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="mary.c21.p33"><s sid="95" id="mary.c21.s95">Mary's tears flowed afresh, but she had no desire to open her heart to her strangely-found aunt, who had, by her own confession, kept aloof from and neglected them for so many years.</s> <s sid="96" id="mary.c21.s96">Yet she tried to feel grateful for kindness (however late) from any one, and wished to be civil.  Moreover, she had a strong disinclination to speak on the terrible subject uppermost in her mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="mary.c21.p34"><s sid="97" id="mary.c21.s97">So, after a pause, she said--</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="mary.c21.p35" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="mary.c21.s98"><qs/>"Thank you.</s> <s sid="99" id="mary.c21.s99">I dare say you mean very kind.</s> <s sid="100" id="mary.c21.s100">Have you had a long walk?</s> <s sid="101" id="mary.c21.s101">I'm so sorry,"<qe/><sls/> said she, rising with a sudden thought, which was as suddenly checked by recollection, <sle/><qs/>"but I've nothing to eat in the house, and I'm sure you must be hungry, after your walk."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="mary.c21.p36"><s sid="102" id="mary.c21.s102">For Mary concluded that certainly her aunt's residence must be far away on the other side of the town, out of sight or hearing.</s> <s sid="103" id="mary.c21.s103">But, after all, she did not think much about her; her heart was so aching-full of other things, that all besides seemed like a dream.</s> <s sid="104" id="mary.c21.s104">She received feelings and impressions from her conversation with her aunt, but did not, could not, put them together, or think or argue about them.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="mary.c21.p37"><s sid="105" id="mary.c21.s105">And Esther!</s> <s sid="106" id="mary.c21.s106">How scanty had been her food for days and weeks, her thinly-covered bones and pale lips might tell, but her words should never reveal!</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="mary.c21.p38"><s sid="107" id="mary.c21.s107">So, with a little unreal laugh, she replied--</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="mary.c21.p39" type="speech"><s sid="108" id="mary.c21.s108"><qs/>"Oh!</s> <s sid="109" id="mary.c21.s109">Mary, my dear! don't talk about eating.</s> <s sid="110" id="mary.c21.s110">We've the best of everything, and plenty of it, for my husband is in good work.</s> <s sid="111" id="mary.c21.s111">I'd such a supper before I came out.</s> <s sid="112" id="mary.c21.s112">I couldn't touch a morsel if you had it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="mary.c21.p40"><s sid="113" id="mary.c21.s113">Her words shot a strange pang through Mary's heart.</s> <s sid="114" id="mary.c21.s114">She had always remembered her aunt's loving and unselfish disposition; how was it changed, if, living in plenty, she had never thought it worth while to ask after her relations who were all but starving!</s> <s sid="115" id="mary.c21.s115">She shut up her heart instinctively against her aunt.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="mary.c21.p41"><s sid="116" id="mary.c21.s116">And all the time poor Esther was swallowing her sobs, and over- acting her part, and controlling herself more than she had done for many a long day, in order that her niece might not be shocked and revolted, by the knowledge of what her aunt had become--a prostitute; an outcast.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="mary.c21.p42"><s sid="117" id="mary.c21.s117">She had longed to open her wretched, wretched heart, so hopeless, so abandoned by all living things, to one who had loved her once; and yet she refrained, from dread of the averted eye, the altered voice, the internal loathing, which she feared such disclosure might create.</s> <s sid="118" id="mary.c21.s118">She would go straight to the subject of the day.</s> <s sid="119" id="mary.c21.s119">She could not tarry long, for she felt unable to support the character she had assumed for any length of time.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="mary.c21.p43"><s sid="120" id="mary.c21.s120">They sat by the little round table, facing each other.</s> <s sid="121" id="mary.c21.s121">The candle was placed right between them, and Esther moved it in order to have a clearer view of Mary's face, so that she might read her emotions, and ascertain her interests.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="mary.c21.p44"><s sid="122" id="mary.c21.s122">Then she began--</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="mary.c21.p45" type="speech"><s sid="123" id="mary.c21.s123"><qs/>"It's a bad business, I'm afraid, this of Mr. Carson's murder."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="mary.c21.p46"><s sid="124" id="mary.c21.s124">Mary winced a little.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="mary.c21.p47" type="speech"><s sid="125" id="mary.c21.s125"><qs/>"I hear Jem Wilson is taken up for it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="mary.c21.p48"><s sid="126" id="mary.c21.s126">Mary covered her eyes with her hands, as if to shade them from the light, and Esther herself, less accustomed to self-command, was getting too much agitated for calm observation of another.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="mary.c21.p49" type="speech"><s sid="127" id="mary.c21.s127"><qs/>"I was taking a walk near Turner Street, and I went to see the spot,"<qe/><sss/> continued Esther, <sse/><qs/>"and, as luck would have it, I spied this bit of paper in the hedge,"<qe/> producing the precious piece still folded in her hand.</s> <s sid="128" id="mary.c21.s128"><qs/>"It has been used as wadding for the gun, I reckon; indeed, that's clear enough, from the shape it's crammed into.</s> <s sid="129" id="mary.c21.s129">I was sorry for the murderer, whoever he might be (I didn't then know of Jem's being suspected), and I thought I would never leave a thing about as might help, ever so little, to convict him; the police are so 'cute about straws.</s> <s sid="130" id="mary.c21.s130">So I carried it a little way, and then I opened it and saw your name, Mary."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="mary.c21.p50"><s sid="131" id="mary.c21.s131">Mary took her hands away from her eyes, and looked with surprise at her aunt's face, as she uttered these words.</s> <s sid="132" id="mary.c21.s132">She WAS kind after all, for was she not saving her from being summoned, and from being questioned and examined; a thing to be dreaded above all others: as she felt sure that her unwilling answers, frame them how she might, would add to the suspicions against Jem; her aunt was indeed kind, to think of what would spare her this.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="mary.c21.p51"><s sid="133" id="mary.c21.s133">Esther went on, without noticing Mary's look.</s> <s sid="134" id="mary.c21.s134">The very action of speaking was so painful to her, and so much interrupted by the hard, raking little cough, which had been her constant annoyance for months, that she was too much engrossed by the physical difficulty of utterance, to be a very close observer.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mary.c23.p2"><s sid="4" id="mary.c23.s4">Her heart beating, her head full of ideas, which required time and solitude to be reduced into order, Mary hurried home.</s> <s sid="5" id="mary.c23.s5">She was like one who finds a jewel of which he cannot all at once ascertain the value, but who hides his treasure until some quiet hour when he may ponder over the capabilities its possession unfolds.</s> <s sid="6" id="mary.c23.s6">She was like one who discovers the silken clue which guides to some bower of bliss, and secure of the power within his grasp, has to wait for a time before he may thread the labyrinth.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mary.c23.p3"><s sid="7" id="mary.c23.s7">But no jewel, no bower of bliss was ever so precious to miser or lover as was the belief which now pervaded Mary's mind that Jem's innocence might be proved, without involving any suspicion of that other--that dear one, so dear, although so criminal--on whose part in this cruel business she dared not dwell even in thought.</s> <s sid="8" id="mary.c23.s8">For if she did there arose the awful question,--if all went against Jem the innocent, if judge and jury gave the verdict forth which had the looming gallows in the rear, what ought she to do, possessed of her terrible knowledge?</s> <s sid="9" id="mary.c23.s9">Surely not to inculpate her father--and yet-- and yet--she almost prayed for the blessed unconsciousness of death or madness, rather than that awful question should have to be answered by her.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mary.c23.p5"><s sid="14" id="mary.c23.s14">She had still to collect her thoughts and freshen her memory enough to arrange how to meet with Will--for to the chances of a letter she would not trust; to find out his lodgings when in Liverpool; to try and remember the name of the ship in which he was to sail: and the more she considered these points, the more difficulty she found there would be in ascertaining these minor but important facts.</s> <s sid="15" id="mary.c23.s15">For you are aware that Alice, whose memory was clear and strong on all points in which her heart was interested, was lying in a manner senseless: that Jane Wilson was (to use her own word, so expressive to a Lancashire ear) "dazed"; that is to say, bewildered, lost in the confusion of terrifying and distressing thoughts; incapable of concentrating her mind; and at the best of times Will's proceedings were a matter of little importance to her (or so she pretended), she was so jealous of aught which distracted attention from her pearl of price, her only son Jem.</s> <s sid="16" id="mary.c23.s16">So Mary felt hopeless of obtaining any intelligence of the sailor's arrangements from her.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mary.c23.p14" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="mary.c23.s44"><qs/>"What is it?"<qe/> asked she, in a voice from which all the pith and marrow seemed extracted.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mary.c24.p15"><s sid="28" id="mary.c24.s28">Mrs. Wilson had waited patiently while this whispered speech was being uttered, imagining, perhaps, that it would end in some explanation addressed to her.</s> <s sid="29" id="mary.c24.s29">But when both were silent, though their eyes, without speech or language, told their hearts' pity, she spoke again in the same unaltered gentle voice (so different from the irritable impatience she had been ever apt to show to everyone except her husband--he who had wedded her, broken-down and injured),--in a voice so different, I say, from the old, hasty manner, she spoke now the same anxious words--</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mary.c24.p16" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="mary.c24.s30"><qs/>"What is this?</s> <s sid="31" id="mary.c24.s31">Will you tell me?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mary.c24.p17" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="mary.c24.s32"><qs/>"Yo'd better give it me at once, Mrs. Wilson, and let me put it out of your sight.</s> <s sid="33" id="mary.c24.s33">Speak to her, Mary, wench, and ask for a sight on it; I've tried and better-tried to get it from her, and she takes no heed of words, and I'm loth to pull it by force out of her hands."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mary.c24.p18"><s sid="34" id="mary.c24.s34">Mary drew the little "cricket" out from under the dresser, and sat down at Mrs. Wilson's knee, and, coaxing one of her tremulous ever-moving hands into hers, began to rub it soothingly; there was a little resistance--a very little, but that was all; and presently, in the nervous movement of the imprisoned hand, the parchment fell to the ground.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mary.c24.p19"><s sid="35" id="mary.c24.s35">Mary calmly and openly picked it up, without any attempt at concealment, and quietly placing it in sight of the anxious eyes that followed it with a kind of spell-bound dread, went on with her soothing caresses.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mary.c24.p20" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="mary.c24.s36"><qs/>"She has had no sleep for many nights,"<qe/><sls/> said the girl to Mrs. Davenport, <sle/><qs/>"and all this woe and sorrow,--it's no wonder."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mary.c24.p23"><s sid="40" id="mary.c24.s40">For, you see, they spoke before her as if she were not there; her heart was so far away.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mary.c24.p24"><s sid="41" id="mary.c24.s41">Accordingly they almost lifted her from the chair, in which she sat motionless, and taking her up as gently as a mother carries her sleeping baby, they undressed her poor, worn form, and laid her in the little bed upstairs.</s> <s sid="42" id="mary.c24.s42">They had once thought of placing her in Jem's bed, to be out of sight or sound of any disturbance of Alice's; but then again they remembered the shock she might receive in awakening in so unusual a place, and also that Mary, who intended to keep vigil that night in the house of mourning, would find it difficult to divide her attention in the possible cases that might ensue.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="mary.c24.p25"><s sid="43" id="mary.c24.s43">So they laid her, as I said before, on that little pallet bed; and, as they were slowly withdrawing from the bedside, hoping and praying that she might sleep, and forget for a time her heavy burden, she looked wistfully after Mary, and whispered--</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="mary.c24.p26" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="mary.c24.s44"><qs/>"You haven't told me what it is.</s> <s sid="45" id="mary.c24.s45">What is it?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="mary.c24.p27"><s sid="46" id="mary.c24.s46">And gazing in her face for the expected answer, her eyelids slowly closed, and she fell into a deep, heavy sleep, almost as profound a rest as death.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="mary.c24.p28"><s sid="47" id="mary.c24.s47">Mrs. Davenport went her way, and Mary was alone,--for I cannot call those who sleep allies against the agony of thought which solitude sometimes brings up.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="mary.c24.p29"><s sid="48" id="mary.c24.s48">She dreaded the night before her.</s> <s sid="49" id="mary.c24.s49">Alice might die; the doctor had that day declared her case hopeless, and not far from death; and at times, the terror so natural to the young, not of death, but of the remains of the dead, came over Mary; and she bent and listened anxiously for the long-drawn, pausing breath of the sleeping Alice.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="mary.c24.p30"><s sid="50" id="mary.c24.s50">Or Mrs. Wilson might awake in a state which Mary dreaded to anticipate, and anticipated while she dreaded;--in a state of complete delirium.</s> <s sid="51" id="mary.c24.s51">Already her senses had been severely stunned by the full explanation of what was required of her--of what she had to prove against her son, her Jem, her only child--which Mary could not doubt the officious Mrs. Heming had given; and what if in dreams (that land into which no sympathy or love can penetrate with another, either to share its bliss or its agony--that land whose scenes are unspeakable terrors, are hidden mysteries, are priceless treasures to one alone--that land where alone I may see, while yet I tarry here, the sweet looks of my dear child)--what if, in the horrors of her dreams, her brain should go still more astray, and she should waken crazy with her visions, and the terrible reality that begot them?</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="mary.c24.p31"><s sid="52" id="mary.c24.s52">How much worse is anticipation sometimes than reality!</s> <s sid="53" id="mary.c24.s53">How Mary dreaded that night, and how calmly it passed by!</s> <s sid="54" id="mary.c24.s54">Even more so than if Mary had not had such claims upon her care!</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="mary.c24.p32"><s sid="55" id="mary.c24.s55">Anxiety about them deadened her own peculiar anxieties.</s> <s sid="56" id="mary.c24.s56">She thought of the sleepers whom she was watching, till, overpowered herself by the want of rest, she fell off into short slumbers in which the night wore imperceptibly away.</s> <s sid="57" id="mary.c24.s57">To be sure, Alice spoke, and sang during her waking moments, like the child she deemed herself; but so happily with the dearly-loved ones around her, with the scent of the heather, and the song of the wild bird hovering about her in imagination--with old scraps of ballads, or old snatches of primitive versions of the Psalms (such as are sung in country churches half draperied over with ivy, and where the running brook, or the murmuring wind among the trees makes fit accompaniment to the chorus of human voices uttering praise and thanksgiving to their God)--that the speech and the song gave comfort and good cheer to the listener's heart, and the grey dawn began to dim the light of the rush-candle, before Mary thought it possible that day was already trembling in the horizon.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="mary.c24.p33" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="mary.c24.s58">Then she got up from the chair where she had been dozing, and went, half-asleep, to the window to assure herself that morning was at hand.</s> <s sid="59" id="mary.c24.s59">The streets were unusually quiet with a Sabbath stillness.</s> <s sid="60" id="mary.c24.s60">No factory bells that morning; no early workmen going to their labours; no slip-shod girls cleaning the windows of the little shops which broke the monotony of the street; instead, you might see here and there some operative sallying forth for a breath of country air, or some father leading out his wee toddling bairns for the unwonted pleasure of a walk with <qs/>"Daddy,"<qe/> in the clear frosty morning.</s> <s sid="61" id="mary.c24.s61">Men with more leisure on week-days would perhaps have walked quicker than they did through the fresh sharp air of this Sunday morning; but to them there was a pleasure, an absolute refreshment in the dawdling gait they, one and all of them, had.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="mary.c24.p34"><s sid="62" id="mary.c24.s62">There were, indeed, one or two passengers on that morning whose objects were less innocent and less praiseworthy than those of the people I have already mentioned, and whose animal state of mind and body clashed jarringly on the peacefulness of the day, but upon them I will not dwell; as you and I, and almost every one, I think, may send up our individual cry of self-reproach that we have not done all that we could for the stray and wandering ones of our brethren.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="mary.c24.p35"><s sid="63" id="mary.c24.s63">When Mary turned from the window, she went to the bed of each sleeper, to look and listen.</s> <s sid="64" id="mary.c24.s64">Alice looked perfectly quiet and happy in her slumber, and her face seemed to have become much more youthful during the painless approach to death.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="mary.c24.p36"><s sid="65" id="mary.c24.s65">Mrs. Wilson's countenance was stamped with the anxiety of the last few days, although she, too, appeared sleeping soundly; but as Mary gazed on her, trying to trace a likeness to her son in her face, she awoke and looked up into Mary's eyes, while the expression of consciousness came back into her own.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="mary.c24.p37"><s sid="66" id="mary.c24.s66">Both were silent for a minute or two.</s> <s sid="67" id="mary.c24.s67">Mary's eyes had fallen beneath that penetrating gaze, in which the agony of memory seemed every minute to find fuller vent.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="mary.c24.p38" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="mary.c24.s68"><qs/>"Is it a dream?"<qe/> the mother asked at last in a low voice.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="mary.c24.p39" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="mary.c24.s69"><qs/>"No!"<qe/> replied Mary, in the same tone.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="mary.c24.p40"><s sid="70" id="mary.c24.s70">Mrs. Wilson hid her face in the pillow.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="mary.c24.p41"><s sid="71" id="mary.c24.s71">She was fully conscious of everything this morning; it was evident that the stunning effect of the sub-poena, which had affected her so much last night in her weak, worn-out state, had passed away.</s> <s sid="72" id="mary.c24.s72">Mary offered no opposition when she indicated by languid gesture and action that she wished to rise.</s> <s sid="73" id="mary.c24.s73">A sleepless bed is a haunted place.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="mary.c24.p42"><s sid="74" id="mary.c24.s74">When she was dressed with Mary's aid, she stood by Alice for a minute or two looking at the slumberer.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="mary.c24.p43" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="mary.c24.s75"><qs/>"How happy she is!"<qe/> said she, quietly and sadly.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="mary.c24.p44"><s sid="76" id="mary.c24.s76">All the time that Mary was getting breakfast ready, and performing every other little domestic office she could think of, to add to the comfort of Jem's mother, Mrs. Wilson sat still in the arm-chair, watching her silently.</s> <s sid="77" id="mary.c24.s77">Her old irritation of temper and manner seemed to have suddenly disappeared, or perhaps she was too depressed in body and mind to show it.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="mary.c24.p45"><s sid="78" id="mary.c24.s78">Mary told her all that had been done with regard to Mr. Bridgnorth; all her own plans for seeking out Will; all her hopes; and concealed as well as she could all the doubts and fears that would arise unbidden.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="mary.c24.p46" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="mary.c24.s79">To this Mrs. Wilson listened without much remark, but with deep interest and perfect comprehension.</s> <s sid="80" id="mary.c24.s80">When Mary ceased, she sighed, and said, <qs/>"O wench!</s> <s sid="81" id="mary.c24.s81">I am his mother, and yet I do so little, I can do so little!</s> <s sid="82" id="mary.c24.s82">That's what frets me!</s> <s sid="83" id="mary.c24.s83">I seem like a child as sees its mammy ill, and moans and cries its little heart out, yet does nought to help.</s> <s sid="84" id="mary.c24.s84">I think my sense has left me all at once, and I can't even find strength to cry like the little child."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="mary.c24.p47"><s sid="85" id="mary.c24.s85">Hereupon she broke into a feeble wail of self-reproach, that her outward show of misery was not greater; as if any cries, or tears, or loud-spoken words could have told of such pangs at the heart as that look, and that thin, piping, altered voice!</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="mary.c24.p48"><s sid="86" id="mary.c24.s86">But think of Mary and what she was enduring.</s> <s sid="87" id="mary.c24.s87">Picture to yourself (for I cannot tell you) the armies of thoughts that met and clashed in her brain; and then imagine the effort it cost her to be calm, and quiet, and even in a faint way, cheerful and smiling at times.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="mary.c24.p49"><s sid="88" id="mary.c24.s88">After a while she began to stir about in her own mind for some means of sparing the poor mother the trial of appearing as a witness in the matter of the gun.</s> <s sid="89" id="mary.c24.s89">She had made no allusion to her summons this morning, and Mary almost thought she must have forgotten it; and surely some means might be found to prevent that additional sorrow.</s> <s sid="90" id="mary.c24.s90">She must see Job about it; nay, if necessary, she must see Mr. Bridgnorth, with all his truth-compelling powers; for, indeed, she had so struggled and triumphed (though a sadly-bleeding victor at heart) over herself these two last days, had so concealed agony, and hidden her inward woe and bewilderment, that she began to take confidence, and to have faith in her own powers of meeting any one with a passably fair show, whatever might be rending her life beneath the cloak of her deception.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="mary.c24.p50"><s sid="91" id="mary.c24.s91">Accordingly, as soon as Mrs. Davenport came in after morning church, to ask after the two lone women, and she had heard the report Mary had to give (so much better as regarded Mrs. Wilson than what they had feared the night before it would have been)--as soon as this kind-hearted, grateful woman came in, Mary, telling her purpose, went off to fetch the doctor who attended Alice.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="mary.c24.p51"><s sid="92" id="mary.c24.s92">He was shaking himself after his morning's round, and happy in the anticipation of his Sunday's dinner; but he was a good-tempered man, who found it difficult to keep down his jovial easiness even by the bed of sickness or death.</s> <s sid="93" id="mary.c24.s93">He had mischosen his profession; for it was his delight to see every one around him in full enjoyment of life.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="mary.c24.p52"><s sid="94" id="mary.c24.s94">However, he subdued his face to the proper expression of sympathy, befitting a doctor listening to a patient, or a patient's friend (and Mary's sad, pale, anxious face might be taken for either the one or the other).</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="mary.c24.p53" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="mary.c24.s95"><qs/>"Well my girl! and what brings you here?"<qe/> said he, as he entered his surgery.</s> <s sid="96" id="mary.c24.s96"><qs/>"Not on your own account, I hope."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="mary.c24.p54" type="speech"><s sid="97" id="mary.c24.s97"><qs/>"I wanted you to come and see Alice Wilson,--and then I thought you would maybe take a look at Mrs. Wilson."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="mary.c24.p55"><s sid="98" id="mary.c24.s98">He bustled on his hat and coat, and followed Mary instantly.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="mary.c24.p56"><s sid="99" id="mary.c24.s99">After shaking his head over Alice (as if it was a mournful thing for one so pure and good, so true, although so humble a Christian, to be nearing her desired haven), and muttering the accustomed words intended to destroy hope, and prepare anticipation, he went, in compliance with Mary's look, to ask the usual questions of Mrs. Wilson, who sat passively in her arm-chair.</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="mary.c24.p57"><s sid="100" id="mary.c24.s100">She answered his questions, and submitted to his examination.</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="mary.c24.p59" type="speech"><s sid="102" id="mary.c24.s102"><qs/>"Why--a,"<qe/> began he, perceiving that he was desired to take one side in his answer, and unable to find out whether his listener was anxious for a favourable verdict or otherwise; but thinking it most probable that she would desire the former, he continued--</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="mary.c24.p60" type="speech"><s sid="103" id="mary.c24.s103"><qs/>"She is weak, certainly; the natural result of such a shock as the arrest of her son would be,--for I understand this James Wilson, who murdered Mr. Carson, was her son.</s> <s sid="104" id="mary.c24.s104">Sad thing to have such a reprobate in the family."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="mary.c24.p61" type="speech"><s sid="105" id="mary.c24.s105"><qs/>"You say <alt-qs/>'WHO MURDERED,'<alt-qe/> sir!"<qe/> said Mary indignantly.</s> <s sid="106" id="mary.c24.s106"><qs/>"He is only taken up on suspicion, and many have no doubt of his innocence-- those who know him, sir."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="mary.c24.p63" type="speech"><s sid="109" id="mary.c24.s109"><qs/>"But you don't think her fit to go to Liverpool?"<qe/> asked Mary, still in the anxious tone of one who wishes earnestly for some particular decision.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mary.c25.p3"><s sid="5" id="mary.c25.s5">Mary went home.</s> <s sid="6" id="mary.c25.s6">Oh! how her head did ache, and how dizzy her brain was growing!</s> <s sid="7" id="mary.c25.s7">But there would be time enough she felt for giving way hereafter.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mary.c25.p4"><s sid="8" id="mary.c25.s8">So she sat quiet and still by an effort; sitting near the window, and looking out of it, but seeing nothing, when all at once she caught sight of something which roused her up, and made her draw back.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mary.c25.p5"><s sid="9" id="mary.c25.s9">But it was too late.</s> <s sid="10" id="mary.c25.s10">She had been seen.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mary.c25.p6"><s sid="11" id="mary.c25.s11">Sally Leadbitter flaunted into the little dingy room, making it gaudy with the Sunday excess of colouring in her dress.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mary.c25.p7"><s sid="12" id="mary.c25.s12">She was really curious to see Mary; her connection with a murderer seemed to have made her into a sort of lusus naturae, and was almost, by some, expected to have made a change in her personal appearance, so earnestly did they stare at her.</s> <s sid="13" id="mary.c25.s13">But Mary had been too much absorbed the last day or two to notice this.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mary.c25.p8" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="mary.c25.s14">Now Sally had a grand view, and looked her over and over (a very different thing from looking her through and through), and almost learnt her off by heart:--<qs/>"Her every-day gown (Hoyle's print you know, that lilac thing with the high body) she was so fond of; a little black silk handkerchief just knotted round her neck, like a boy; her hair all taken back from her face, as if she wanted to keep her head cool--she would always keep that hair of hers so long; and her hands twitching continually about"<qe/>--</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mary.c25.p9"><s sid="15" id="mary.c25.s15">Such particulars would make Sally into a Gazette Extraordinary the next morning at the workroom and were worth coming for, even if little else could be extracted from Mary.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mary.c25.p10" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="mary.c25.s16"><qs/>"Why, Mary!"<qe/> she began.</s> <s sid="17" id="mary.c25.s17"><qs/>"Where have you hidden yourself?</s> <s sid="18" id="mary.c25.s18">You never showed your face all yesterday at Miss Simmonds's.</s> <s sid="19" id="mary.c25.s19">You don't fancy we think any the worse of you for what's come and gone.</s> <s sid="20" id="mary.c25.s20">Some on us, indeed, were a bit sorry for the poor young man, as lies stiff and cold for your sake, Mary; but we shall ne'er cast it up against you.</s> <s sid="21" id="mary.c25.s21">Miss Simmonds, too, will be mighty put out if you don't come, for there's a deal of mourning, agait."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mary.c25.p11" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="mary.c25.s22"><qs/>"I can't,"<qe/> Mary said, in a low voice.</s> <s sid="23" id="mary.c25.s23"><qs/>"I don't mean ever to come again."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mary.c25.p12" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="mary.c25.s24"><qs/>"Why, Mary!"<qe/> said Sally, in unfeigned surprise.</s> <s sid="25" id="mary.c25.s25"><qs/>"To be sure, you'll have to be in Liverpool, Tuesday, and maybe Wednesday; but after that you'll surely come, and tell us all about it.</s> <s sid="26" id="mary.c25.s26">Miss Simmonds knows you'll have to be off those two days.</s> <s sid="27" id="mary.c25.s27">But between you and me, she's a bit of a gossip, and will like hearing all how and about the trial, well enough to let you off very easy for your being absent a day or two.</s> <s sid="28" id="mary.c25.s28">Besides, Betsy Morgan was saying yesterday, she shouldn't wonder but you'd prove quite an attraction to customers.</s> <s sid="29" id="mary.c25.s29">Many a one would come and have their gowns made by Miss Simmonds just to catch a glimpse at you, at after the trial's over.</s> <s sid="30" id="mary.c25.s30">Really, Mary, you'll turn out quite a heroine."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mary.c25.p13"><s sid="31" id="mary.c25.s31">The little fingers twitched worse than ever; the large soft eyes looked up pleadingly into Sally's face; but she went on in the same strain, not from any unkind or cruel feeling towards Mary, but solely because she was incapable of comprehending her suffering.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mary.c25.p14"><s sid="32" id="mary.c25.s32">She had been shocked, of course, at Mr. Carson's death, though at the same time the excitement was rather pleasant than otherwise; and dearly now would she have enjoyed the conspicuous notice which Mary was sure to receive.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mary.c25.p15" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="mary.c25.s33"><qs/>"How shall you like being cross-examined, Mary?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mary.c25.p16" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="mary.c25.s34"><qs/>"Not at all,"<qe/> answered Mary, when she found she must answer.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mary.c25.p17" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="mary.c25.s35">"La! what impudent fellows those lawyers are!</s> <s sid="36" id="mary.c25.s36">And their clerks, too, not a bit better.</s> <s sid="37" id="mary.c25.s37">I shouldn't wonder" (in a comforting tone, and really believing she was giving comfort) <qs/>"if you picked up a new sweetheart in Liverpool.</s> <s sid="38" id="mary.c25.s38">What gown are you going in, Mary?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mary.c25.p18" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="mary.c25.s39"><qs/>"Oh, I don't know and don't care,"<qe/> exclaimed Mary, sick and weary of her visitor.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mary.c25.p19" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="mary.c25.s40"><qs/>"Well, then! take my advice, and go in that blue merino.</s> <s sid="41" id="mary.c25.s41">It's old to be sure, and a bit worn at elbows, but folk won't notice that, and th' colour suits you.</s> <s sid="42" id="mary.c25.s42">Now mind, Mary.</s> <s sid="43" id="mary.c25.s43">And I'll lend you my black-watered scarf,"<qe/> added she really good-naturedly, according to her sense of things, and withal, a little bit pleased at the idea of her pet article of dress figuring away on the person of a witness at a trial for murder.</s> <s sid="44" id="mary.c25.s44"><qs/>"I'll bring it to-morrow before you start."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mary.c25.p20" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="mary.c25.s45"><qs/>"No, don't!"<qe/><sss/> said Mary; <sse/><qs/>"thank you, but I don't want it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mary.c25.p21" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="mary.c25.s46"><qs/>"Why, what can you wear?</s> <s sid="47" id="mary.c25.s47">I know all your clothes as well as I do my own, and what is there you can wear?</s> <s sid="48" id="mary.c25.s48">Not your old plaid shawl, I do hope?</s> <s sid="49" id="mary.c25.s49">You would not fancy this I have on, more nor the scarf, would you?"<qe/> said she, brightening up at the thought, and willing to lend it, or anything else.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mary.c25.p22" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="mary.c25.s50"><qs/>"O Sally! don't go on talking a-that-ns; how can I think on dress at such a time?</s> <s sid="51" id="mary.c25.s51">When it's a matter of life and death to Jem?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mary.c25.p23" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="mary.c25.s52"><qs/>"Bless the girl!</s> <s sid="53" id="mary.c25.s53">It's Jem, is it?</s> <s sid="54" id="mary.c25.s54">Well now, I thought there was some sweetheart in the background, when you flew off so with Mr. Carson.</s> <s sid="55" id="mary.c25.s55">Then what, in the name of goodness, made him shoot Mr. Harry?</s> <s sid="56" id="mary.c25.s56">After you had given up going with him, I mean?</s> <s sid="57" id="mary.c25.s57">Was he afraid you'd be on again?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mary.c25.p24" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="mary.c25.s58"><qs/>"How dare you say he shot Mr. Harry?"<qe/> asked Mary, firing up from the state of languid indifference into which she had sunk while Sally had been settling about her dress.</s> <s sid="59" id="mary.c25.s59"><qs/>"But it's no matter what you think as did not know him.</s> <s sid="60" id="mary.c25.s60">What grieves me is, that people should go on thinking him guilty as did know him,"<qe/> she said, sinking back into her former depressed tone and manner.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="mary.c25.p25" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="mary.c25.s61"><qs/>"And don't you think he did it?"<qe/> asked Sally.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="mary.c25.p26"><s sid="62" id="mary.c25.s62">Mary paused; she was going on too fast with one so curious and so unscrupulous.</s> <s sid="63" id="mary.c25.s63">Besides, she remembered how even she herself had, at first, believed him guilty; and she felt it was not for her to cast stones at those who, on similar evidence, inclined to the same belief.</s> <s sid="64" id="mary.c25.s64">None had given him much benefit of a doubt.</s> <s sid="65" id="mary.c25.s65">None had faith in his innocence.</s> <s sid="66" id="mary.c25.s66">None but his mother; and the heart loved more than the head reasoned, and her yearning affection had never for an instant entertained the idea that her Jem was a murderer.</s> <s sid="67" id="mary.c25.s67">But Mary disliked the whole conversation; the subject, the manner in which it was treated, were all painful, and she had a repugnance to the person with whom she spoke.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="mary.c25.p27" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="mary.c25.s68">She was thankful, therefore, when Job Legh's voice was heard at the door, as he stood with the latch in his hand, talking to a neighbour, and when Sally jumped up in vexation and said, <qs/>"There's that old fogey coming in here, as I'm alive!</s> <s sid="69" id="mary.c25.s69">Did your father set him to look after you while he was away? or what brings the old chap here?</s> <s sid="70" id="mary.c25.s70">However, I'm off; I never could abide either him or his prim grand-daughter.</s> <s sid="71" id="mary.c25.s71">Good-bye, Mary."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="mary.c25.p28" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="mary.c25.s72">So far in a whisper, then louder, <qs/>"If you think better of my offer about the scarf, Mary, just step in to-morrow before nine, and you're quite welcome to it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="mary.c25.p29"><s sid="73" id="mary.c25.s73">She and Job passed each other at the door, with mutual looks of dislike, which neither took any pains to conceal.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="mary.c25.p30" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="mary.c25.s74"><qs/>"Yon's a bold, bad girl,"<qe/> said Job to Mary.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="mary.c25.p31" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="mary.c25.s75"><qs/>"She's very good-natured,"<qe/> replied Mary, too honourable to abuse a visitor, who had only that instant crossed her threshold, and gladly dwelling on the good quality most apparent in Sally's character.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="mary.c25.p32" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="mary.c25.s76"><qs/>"Ay, ay! good-natured, generous, jolly, full of fun; there are a number of other names for the good qualities the devil leaves his children, as baits to catch gudgeons with.</s> <s sid="77" id="mary.c25.s77">D'ye think folk could be led astray by one who was every way bad?</s> <s sid="78" id="mary.c25.s78">Howe'er, that's not what I came to talk about.</s> <s sid="79" id="mary.c25.s79">I've seen Mr. Bridgnorth, and he is in a manner the same mind as we; he thinks it would have an awkward look, and might tell against the poor lad on his trial; still if she's ill she's ill, and it can't be helped."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="mary.c25.p33" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="mary.c25.s80"><qs/>"I don't know if she's so bad as all that,"<qe/> said Mary, who began to dread her part in doing anything which might tell against her poor lover.</s> <s sid="81" id="mary.c25.s81"><qs/>"Will you come and see her, Job?</s> <s sid="82" id="mary.c25.s82">The doctor seemed to say as I liked, not as he thought."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="mary.c25.p34" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="mary.c25.s83"><qs/>"That's because he had no great thought on the subject, either one way or t'other,"<qe/> replied Job, whose contempt for medical men pretty nearly equalled his respect for lawyers.</s> <s sid="84" id="mary.c25.s84"><qs/>"But I'll go and welcome.</s> <s sid="85" id="mary.c25.s85">I han not seen th' ould ladies since their sorrows, and it's but manners to go and ax after them.</s> <s sid="86" id="mary.c25.s86">Come along."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="mary.c25.p35"><s sid="87" id="mary.c25.s87">The room at Mrs. Wilson's had that still, changeless look you must have often observed in the house of sickness or mourning.</s> <s sid="88" id="mary.c25.s88">No particular employment going on; people watching and waiting rather than acting, unless in the more sudden and violent attacks: what little movement is going on, so noiseless and hushed; the furniture all arranged and stationary, with a view to the comfort of the afflicted; the window-blinds drawn down to keep out the disturbing variety of a sunbeam; the same saddened serious look on the faces of the indwellers: you fall back into the same train of thought with all these associations, and forget the street, the outer world, in the contemplation of the one stationary, absorbing interest within.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="mary.c25.p36" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="mary.c25.s89">Mrs. Wilson sat quietly in her chair, with just the same look Mary had left on her face; Mrs. Davenport went about with creaking shoes which made all the more noise from her careful and lengthened tread, annoying the ears of those who were well, in this instance, far more than the dull senses of the sick and the sorrowful.</s> <s sid="90" id="mary.c25.s90">Alice's voice still was going on cheerfully in the upper room with incessant talking and little laughs to herself, or perhaps in sympathy with her unseen companions; <qs/>"unseen,"<qe/><sls/> I say, in preference to <sle/><qs/>"fancied,"<qe/> for who knows whether God does not permit the forms of those who were dearest when living, to hover round the bed of the dying?</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="mary.c25.p37"><s sid="91" id="mary.c25.s91">Job spoke, and Mrs. Wilson answered.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="mary.c25.p38"><s sid="92" id="mary.c25.s92">So quietly that it was unnatural under the circumstances.</s> <s sid="93" id="mary.c25.s93">It made a deeper impression on the old man than any token of mere bodily illness could have done.</s> <s sid="94" id="mary.c25.s94">If she had raved in delirium, or moaned in fever, he could have spoken after his wont, and given his opinion, his advice, and his consolation: now he was awed into silence.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="mary.c25.p39"><s sid="95" id="mary.c25.s95">At length he pulled Mary aside into a corner of the house-place, where Mrs. Wilson was sitting, and began to talk to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="mary.c25.p40" type="speech"><s sid="96" id="mary.c25.s96"><qs/>"Yo're right, Mary!</s> <s sid="97" id="mary.c25.s97">She's no ways fit to go to Liverpool, poor soul.</s> <s sid="98" id="mary.c25.s98">Now I've seen her I only wonder the doctor could ha' been unsettled in his mind at th' first.</s> <s sid="99" id="mary.c25.s99">Choose how it goes wi' poor Jem, she cannot go.</s> <s sid="100" id="mary.c25.s100">One way or another it will soon be over; the best to leave her in the state she is till then."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="mary.c25.p41" type="speech"><s sid="101" id="mary.c25.s101"><qs/>"I was sure you would think so,"<qe/> said Mary.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="mary.c25.p42"><s sid="102" id="mary.c25.s102">But they were reckoning without their host.</s> <s sid="103" id="mary.c25.s103">They esteemed her senses gone, while, in fact, they were only inert, and could not convey impressions rapidly to the overburdened, troubled brain.</s> <s sid="104" id="mary.c25.s104">They had not noticed that her eyes had followed them (mechanically it seemed at first) as they had moved away to the corner of the room; that her face, hitherto so changeless, had begun to work with one or two of the old symptoms of impatience.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="mary.c25.p43"><s sid="105" id="mary.c25.s105">But when they were silent she stood up, and startled them almost as if a dead person had spoken, by saying clearly and decidedly--</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="mary.c25.p44" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="mary.c25.s106"><qs/>"I go to Liverpool.</s> <s sid="107" id="mary.c25.s107">I hear you and your plans; and I tell you I shall go to Liverpool.</s> <s sid="108" id="mary.c25.s108">If my words are to kill my son, they have already gone forth out of my mouth, and nought can bring them back.</s> <s sid="109" id="mary.c25.s109">But I will have faith.</s> <s sid="110" id="mary.c25.s110">Alice (up above) has often telled me I wanted faith, and now I will have it.</s> <s sid="111" id="mary.c25.s111">They cannot--they will not kill my child, my only child.</s> <s sid="112" id="mary.c25.s112">I will not be afeard.</s> <s sid="113" id="mary.c25.s113">Yet oh!</s> <s sid="114" id="mary.c25.s114">I am so sick with terror.</s> <s sid="115" id="mary.c25.s115">But if he is to die, think ye not that I will see him again; ay! see him at his trial?</s> <s sid="116" id="mary.c25.s116">When all are hating him, he shall have his poor mother near him, to give him all the comfort, eyes, and looks, and tears, and a heart that is dead to all but him, can give; his poor mother, who knows how free he is from sin--in the sight of man at least.</s> <s sid="117" id="mary.c25.s117">They'll let me go to him, maybe, the very minute it's over; and I know many Scripture texts (though you would not think it), that may keep up his heart.</s> <s sid="118" id="mary.c25.s118">I missed seeing him ere he went to yon prison, but nought shall keep me away again one minute when I can see his face; for maybe the minutes are numbered, and the count but small.</s> <s sid="119" id="mary.c25.s119">I know I can be a comfort to him, poor lad.</s> <s sid="120" id="mary.c25.s120">You would not think it, now, but he'd always speak as kind and soft to me as if he were courting me, like.</s> <s sid="121" id="mary.c25.s121">He loved me above a bit; and am I to leave him now to dree all the cruel slander they'll put upon him?</s> <s sid="122" id="mary.c25.s122">I can pray for him at each hard word they say against him, if I can do nought else; and he'll know what his mother is doing for him, poor lad, by the look on my face."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="mary.c25.p45" type="speech"><s sid="123" id="mary.c25.s123">Still they made some look, or gesture of opposition to her wishes.</s> <s sid="124" id="mary.c25.s124">She turned sharp round on Mary, the old object of her pettish attacks, and said, <qs/>"Now, wench! once for all, I tell you this.</s> <s sid="125" id="mary.c25.s125">HE could never guide me; and he'd sense enough not to try.</s> <s sid="126" id="mary.c25.s126">What he could na do, don't you try.</s> <s sid="127" id="mary.c25.s127">I shall go to Liverpool tomorrow, and find my lad, and stay with him through thick and thin; and if he dies, why, perhaps, God of His mercy will take me too.</s> <s sid="128" id="mary.c25.s128">The grave is a sure cure for an aching heart!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="mary.c25.p46" type="speech"><s sid="129" id="mary.c25.s129">She sank back in her chair, quite exhausted by the sudden effort she had made; but if they even offered to speak, she cut them short (whatever the subject might be), with the repetition of the same words, <qs/>"I shall go to Liverpool."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="mary.c25.p47"><s sid="130" id="mary.c25.s130">No more could be said, the doctor's opinion had been so undecided; Mr. Bridgnorth had given his legal voice in favour of her going, and Mary was obliged to relinquish the idea of persuading her to remain at home, if, indeed, under all the circumstances, it could be thought desirable.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="mary.c25.p48" type="speech"><s sid="131" id="mary.c25.s131"><qs/>"Best way will be,"<qe/><sss/> said Job, <sse/><qs/>"for me to hunt out Will, early tomorrow morning, and yo, Mary, come at after with Jane Wilson.</s> <s sid="132" id="mary.c25.s132">I know a decent woman where yo two can have a bed, and where we may meet together when I've found Will, afore going to Mr. Bridgnorth's at two o'clock; for, I can tell him, I'll not trust none of his clerks for hunting up Will, if Jem's life's to depend on it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="mary.c25.p49"><s sid="133" id="mary.c25.s133">Now Mary disliked this plan inexpressibly; her dislike was partly grounded on reason, and partly on feeling.</s> <s sid="134" id="mary.c25.s134">She could not bear the idea of deputing to any one the active measures necessary to be taken in order to save Jem.</s> <s sid="135" id="mary.c25.s135">She felt as if they were her duty, her right.</s> <s sid="136" id="mary.c25.s136">She durst not trust to any one the completion of her plan: they might not have energy, or perseverance, or desperation enough to follow out the slightest chance; and her love would endow her with all these qualities independently of the terrible alternative which awaited her in case all failed and Jem was condemned.</s> <s sid="137" id="mary.c25.s137">No one could have her motives; and consequently no one could have her sharpened brain, her despairing determination.</s> <s sid="138" id="mary.c25.s138">Besides (only that was purely selfish), she could not endure the suspense of remaining quiet, and only knowing the result when all was accomplished.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mary.c34.p2"><s sid="11" id="mary.c34.s11">Mary still hovered between life and death when Jem arrived at the house where she lay; and the doctors were as yet unwilling to compromise their wisdom by allowing too much hope to be entertained.</s> <s sid="12" id="mary.c34.s12">But the state of things, if not less anxious, was less distressing than when Jem had quitted her.</s> <s sid="13" id="mary.c34.s13">She lay now in a stupor, which was partly disease, and partly exhaustion after the previous excitement.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mary.c34.p3"><s sid="14" id="mary.c34.s14">And now Jem found the difficulty which every one who has watched by a sick-bed knows full well; and which is perhaps more insurmountable to men than it is to women,--the difficulty of being patient, and trying not to expect any visible change for long, long hours of sad monotony.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mary.c34.p4"><s sid="15" id="mary.c34.s15">But after a while the reward came.</s> <s sid="16" id="mary.c34.s16">The laboured breathing became lower and softer, the heavy look of oppressive pain melted away from the face, and a languor that was almost peace took the place of suffering.</s> <s sid="17" id="mary.c34.s17">She slept a natural sleep; and they stole about on tiptoe, and spoke low, and softly, and hardly dared to breathe, however much they longed to sigh out their thankful relief.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mary.c34.p5"><s sid="18" id="mary.c34.s18">She opened her eyes.</s> <s sid="19" id="mary.c34.s19">Her mind was in the tender state of a lately born infant's.</s> <s sid="20" id="mary.c34.s20">She was pleased with the gay but not dazzling colours of the paper; soothed by the subdued light; and quite sufficiently amused by looking at all the objects in the room--the drawing of the ships, the festoons of the curtain, the bright flowers on the painted backs of the chairs--to care for any stronger excitement.</s> <s sid="21" id="mary.c34.s21">She wondered at the ball of glass, containing various coloured sands from the Isle of Wight, or some other place, which hung suspended from the middle of the little valance over the window.</s> <s sid="22" id="mary.c34.s22">But she did not care to exert herself to ask any questions, although she saw Mrs. Sturgis standing at the bedside with some tea, ready to drop it into her mouth by spoonfuls.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mary.c34.p6"><s sid="23" id="mary.c34.s23">She did not see the face of honest joy, of earnest thankfulness,--the clasped hands, the beaming eyes,--the trembling eagerness of gesture, of one who had long awaited her awakening, and who now stood behind the curtains watching through some little chink her every faint motion; or if she had caught a glimpse of that loving, peeping face, she was in too exhausted a state to have taken much notice, or have long retained the impression that he she loved so well was hanging about her, and blessing God for every conscious look which stole over her countenance.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mary.c34.p7"><s sid="24" id="mary.c34.s24">She fell softly into slumber, without a word having been spoken by any one during that half-hour of inexpressible joy.</s> <s sid="25" id="mary.c34.s25">And again the stillness was enforced by a sign and whispered word, but with eyes that beamed out their bright thoughts of hope.</s> <s sid="26" id="mary.c34.s26">Jem sat by the side of the bed, holding back the little curtain, and gazing as if he could never gaze his fill at the pale, wasted face, so marbled and so chiselled in its wan outline.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mary.c34.p8"><s sid="27" id="mary.c34.s27">She wakened once more; her soft eyes opened, and met his overbending look.</s> <s sid="28" id="mary.c34.s28">She smiled gently, as a baby does when it sees its mother tending its little cot; and continued her innocent, infantine gaze into his face, as if the sight gave her much unconscious pleasure.</s> <s sid="29" id="mary.c34.s29">But by-and-by a different expression came into her sweet eyes; a look of memory and intelligence; her white flesh flushed the brightest rosy red, and with feeble motion she tried to hide her head in the pillow.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mary.c34.p9"><s sid="30" id="mary.c34.s30">It required all Jem's self-control to do what he knew and felt to be necessary, to call Mrs. Sturgis, who was quietly dozing by the fireside; and that done, he felt almost obliged to leave the room to keep down the happy agitation which would gush out in every feature, every gesture, and every tone.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mary.c34.p10"><s sid="31" id="mary.c34.s31">From that time forward Mary's progress towards health was rapid.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mary.c34.p11"><s sid="32" id="mary.c34.s32">There was every reason, but one, in favour of her speedy removal home.</s> <s sid="33" id="mary.c34.s33">All Jem's duties lay in Manchester.</s> <s sid="34" id="mary.c34.s34">It was his mother's dwelling-place, and there his plans for life had been to be worked out; plans which the suspicion and imprisonment he had fallen into, had thrown for a time into a chaos, which his presence was required to arrange into form.</s> <s sid="35" id="mary.c34.s35">For he might find, in spite of a jury's verdict, that too strong a taint was on his character for him ever to labour in Manchester again.</s> <s sid="36" id="mary.c34.s36">He remembered the manner in which some one suspected of having been a convict was shunned by masters and men, when he had accidentally met with work in their foundry; the recollection smote him now, how he himself had thought it did not become an honest upright man to associate with one who had been a prisoner.</s> <s sid="37" id="mary.c34.s37">He could not choose but think on that poor humble being, with his downcast conscious look; hunted out of the workshop, where he had sought to earn an honest livelihood, by the looks, and half-spoken words, and the black silence of repugnance (worse than words to bear), that met him on all sides.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mary.c34.p12"><s sid="38" id="mary.c34.s38">Jem felt that his own character had been attainted; and that to many it might still appear suspicious.</s> <s sid="39" id="mary.c34.s39">He knew that he could convince the world, by a future as blameless as his past had been, that he was innocent.</s> <s sid="40" id="mary.c34.s40">But at the same time he saw that he must have patience, and nerve himself for some trials; and the sooner these were undergone, the sooner he was aware of the place he held in men's estimation, the better.</s> <s sid="41" id="mary.c34.s41">He longed to have presented himself once more at the foundry; and then the reality would drive away the pictures that would (unbidden) come of a shunned man, eyed askance by all, and driven forth to shape out some new career.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mary.c34.p13"><s sid="42" id="mary.c34.s42">I said every reason "but one" inclined Jem to hasten Mary's return as soon as she was sufficiently convalescent.</s> <s sid="43" id="mary.c34.s43">That one was the meeting which awaited her at home.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mary.c34.p14"><s sid="44" id="mary.c34.s44">Turn it over as Jem would, he could not decide what was the best course to pursue.</s> <s sid="45" id="mary.c34.s45">He could compel himself to any line of conduct that his reason and his sense of right told him to be desirable; but they did not tell him it was desirable to speak to Mary, in her tender state of mind and body, of her father.</s> <s sid="46" id="mary.c34.s46">How much would be implied by the mere mention of his name!</s> <s sid="47" id="mary.c34.s47">Speak it as calmly, and as indifferently as he might, he could not avoid expressing some consciousness of the terrible knowledge she possessed.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mary.c34.p15"><s sid="48" id="mary.c34.s48">She, for her part, was softer and gentler than she had even been in her gentlest mood; since her illness, her motions, her glances, her voice were all tender in their languor.</s> <s sid="49" id="mary.c34.s49">It seemed almost a trouble to her to break the silence with the low sounds of her own sweet voice, and her words fell sparingly on Jem's greedy, listening ear.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mary.c34.p16"><s sid="50" id="mary.c34.s50">Her face was, however, so full of love and confidence, that Jem felt no uneasiness at the state of silent abstraction into which she often fell.</s> <s sid="51" id="mary.c34.s51">If she did but love him, all would yet go right; and it was better not to press for confidence on that one subject which must be painful to both.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mary.c34.p17"><s sid="52" id="mary.c34.s52">There came a fine, bright, balmy day.</s> <s sid="53" id="mary.c34.s53">And Mary tottered once more out into the open air, leaning on Jem's arm, and close to his beating heart.</s> <s sid="54" id="mary.c34.s54">And Mrs. Sturgis watched them from her door, with a blessing on her lips, as they went slowly up the street.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mary.c34.p18"><s sid="55" id="mary.c34.s55">They came in sight of the river.</s> <s sid="56" id="mary.c34.s56">Mary shuddered.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mary.c34.p22"><s sid="67" id="mary.c34.s67">She spoke in a feeble voice; not at all impatiently, as the words themselves would seem to intimate, but in a mournful way, as if anticipating sorrow even in the very fulfilment of her wishes.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="mary.c34.p27"><s sid="83" id="mary.c34.s83">He promised; to gratify that beseeching face, he promised.</s> <s sid="84" id="mary.c34.s84">And then he repented, and felt as if he had done ill.  Then again he felt as if she were the best judge, and knowing all (perhaps more than even he did), might be forming plans which his interference would mar.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="mary.c34.p28"><s sid="85" id="mary.c34.s85">One thing was certain! it was a miserable thing to have this awful forbidden ground of discourse; to guess at each other's thoughts, when eyes were averted, and cheeks blanched, and words stood still, arrested in their flow by some casual allusion.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="mary.c34.p29"><s sid="86" id="mary.c34.s86">At last a day, fine enough for Mary to travel on, arrived.</s> <s sid="87" id="mary.c34.s87">She had wished to go, but now her courage failed her.</s> <s sid="88" id="mary.c34.s88">How could she have said she was weary of that quiet house, where even Ben Sturgis's grumblings only made a kind of harmonious bass in the concord between him and his wife, so thoroughly did they know each other with the knowledge of many years!</s> <s sid="89" id="mary.c34.s89">How could she have longed to quit that little peaceful room where she had experienced such loving tendence!</s> <s sid="90" id="mary.c34.s90">Even the very check bed-curtains became dear to her under the idea of seeing them no more.</s> <s sid="91" id="mary.c34.s91">If it was so with inanimate objects, if they had such power of exciting regret, what were her feelings with regard to the kind old couple, who had taken the stranger in, and cared for her, and nursed her, as though she had been a daughter?</s> <s sid="92" id="mary.c34.s92">Each wilful sentence spoken in the half- unconscious irritation of feebleness came now with avenging self-reproach to her memory, as she hung about Mrs. Sturgis, with many tears, which served instead of words to express her gratitude and love.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="mary.c34.p30"><s sid="93" id="mary.c34.s93">Ben bustled about with the square bottle of Goldenwasser in one of his hands, and a small tumbler in the other; he went to Mary, Jem, and his wife in succession, pouring out a glass for each, and bidding them drink it to keep their spirits up; but as each severally refused, he drank it himself; and passed on to offer the same hospitality to another, with the like refusal, and the like result.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="mary.c34.p31"><s sid="94" id="mary.c34.s94">When he had swallowed the last of the three draughts, he condescended to give his reasons for having done so.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="mary.c34.p36"><s sid="107" id="mary.c34.s107">When they reached Manchester, Mary looked very white, and the expression of her face was almost stern.</s> <s sid="108" id="mary.c34.s108">She was in fact summoning up her resolution to meet her father if he were at home.</s> <s sid="109" id="mary.c34.s109">Jem had never named his midnight glimpse of John Barton to human being: but Mary had a sort of presentiment, that wander where he would, he would seek his home at last.</s> <s sid="110" id="mary.c34.s110">But in what mood she dreaded to think.</s> <s sid="111" id="mary.c34.s111">For the knowledge of her father's capability of guilt seemed to have opened a dark gulf in his character, into the depths of which she trembled to look.</s> <s sid="112" id="mary.c34.s112">At one moment she would fain have claimed protection against the life she must lead, for some time at least, alone with a murderer!</s> <s sid="113" id="mary.c34.s113">She thought of his gloom, before his mind was haunted by the memory of so terrible a crime; his moody, irritable ways.</s> <s sid="114" id="mary.c34.s114">She imagined the evenings as of old; she, toiling at some work, long after houses were shut, and folks abed; he, more savage than he had ever been before with the inward gnawing of his remorse.</s> <s sid="115" id="mary.c34.s115">At such times she could have cried aloud with terror, at the scenes her fancy conjured up.</s> </p>

<title>XXXVI.   JEM'S INTERVIEW WITH MR. DUNCOMBE.</title>

<p pid="1" id="mary.c36.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="mary.c36.s1"><qs/>"The first dark day of nothingness, The last of danger and distress."<qe/></s> <s sid="2" id="mary.c36.s2">--BYRON.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mary.c36.p2"><s sid="3" id="mary.c36.s3">Although Mary had hardly been conscious of her thoughts, and it had been more like a secret instinct informing her soul, than the result of any process of reasoning, she had felt for some time (ever since her return from Liverpool, in fact), that for her father there was but one thing to be desired and anticipated, and that was death!</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mary.c36.p3"><s sid="4" id="mary.c36.s4">She had seen that Conscience had given the mortal wound to his earthly frame; she did not dare to question of the infinite mercy of God, what the Future Life would be to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mary.c36.p4"><s sid="5" id="mary.c36.s5">Though at first desolate and stunned by the blow which had fallen on herself, she was resigned and submissive as soon as she recovered strength enough to ponder and consider a little; and you may be sure that no tenderness or love was wanting on Jem's part, and no consideration and sympathy on that of Job and Margaret to soothe and comfort the girl who now stood alone in the world as far as blood relations were concerned.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mary.c36.p5"><s sid="6" id="mary.c36.s6">She did not ask or care to know what arrangements they were making in whispered tones with regard to the funeral.</s> <s sid="7" id="mary.c36.s7">She put herself into their hands with the trust of a little child; glad to be undisturbed in the reveries and remembrances which filled her eyes with tears, and caused them to fall quietly, down her pale cheeks.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mary.c36.p6"><s sid="8" id="mary.c36.s8">It was the longest day she had ever known in her life; every change and every occupation was taken away from her: but perhaps the length of quiet time thus afforded was really good, although its duration weighed upon her; for by this means she contemplated her situation in every light, and fully understood that the morning's event had left her an orphan; and thus she was spared the pangs caused to us by the occurrence of death in the evening, just before we should naturally, in the usual course of events, lie down to slumber.</s> <s sid="9" id="mary.c36.s9">For in such case, worn out by anxiety, and it may be by much watching, our very excess of grief rocks itself to sleep, before we have had time to realise its cause; and we waken, with a start of agony like a fresh stab, to the consciousness of the one awful vacancy, which shall never, while the world endures, be filled again.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mary.c36.p7"><s sid="10" id="mary.c36.s10">The day brought its burden of duty to Mrs. Wilson.</s> <s sid="11" id="mary.c36.s11">She felt bound by regard, as well as by etiquette, to go and see her future daughter-in-law.</s> <s sid="12" id="mary.c36.s12">And by an old association of ideas (perhaps of death with churchyards, and churches with Sunday) she thought it necessary to put on her best, and latterly unused clothes, the airing of which on a little clothes-horse before the fire seemed to give her a not unpleasing occupation.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mary.c36.p8"><s sid="13" id="mary.c36.s13">When Jem returned home late in the evening succeeding John Barton's death, weary and oppressed with the occurrences and excitements of the day, he found his mother busy about her mourning, and much inclined to talk.</s> <s sid="14" id="mary.c36.s14">Although he longed for quiet, he could not avoid sitting down and answering her questions.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mary.c36.p12"><s sid="20" id="mary.c36.s20">It struck Jem that she had not heard of the confession which had been made by John Barton on his death-bed; he remembered Job Legh's discretion, and he determined that if it could be avoided his mother should never hear of it.</s> <s sid="21" id="mary.c36.s21">Many of the difficulties to be anticipated in preserving the secret would be obviated, if he could induce his mother to fall into the plan he had named to Mary of emigrating to Canada.</s> <s sid="22" id="mary.c36.s22">The reasons which rendered this secrecy desirable related to the domestic happiness he hoped for.</s> <s sid="23" id="mary.c36.s23">With his mother's irritable temper he could hardly expect that all allusion to the crime of John Barton would be for ever restrained from passing her lips, and he knew the deep trial which such references would be to Mary.</s> <s sid="24" id="mary.c36.s24">Accordingly he resolved as soon as possible in the morning to go to Job and beseech his silence; he trusted that secrecy in that quarter, even if the knowledge had been extended to Margaret, might be easily secured.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mary.c36.p14"><s sid="26" id="mary.c36.s26">Were there any means by which he might be persuaded to spare John Barton's memory?</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mary.c36.p17" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="mary.c36.s29"><qs/>"He did not make any, mother,"<qe/> replied Jem.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mary.c36.p19" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="mary.c36.s33"><qs/>"He was very restless all night long,"<qe/> said Jem, reluctantly returning to the thoughts of that time.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mary.c36.p20" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="mary.c36.s34"><qs/>"And in course thou plucked the pillow away?</s> <s sid="35" id="mary.c36.s35">Thou didst not!</s> <s sid="36" id="mary.c36.s36">Well! with thy bringing up, and thy learning, thou mightst have known that were the only help in such a case.</s> <s sid="37" id="mary.c36.s37">There were pigeons' feathers in the pillow, depend on't.</s> <s sid="38" id="mary.c36.s38">To think of two grown-up folk like you and Mary, not knowing death could never come easy to a person lying on a pillow with pigeons' feathers in!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mary.c36.p21"><s sid="39" id="mary.c36.s39">Jem was glad to escape from all this talking, to the solitude and quiet of his own room, where he could lie and think uninterruptedly of what had happened and remained to be done.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mary.c36.p22"><s sid="40" id="mary.c36.s40">The first thing was to seek an interview with Mr. Duncombe, his former master.</s> <s sid="41" id="mary.c36.s41">Accordingly, early the next morning Jem set off on his walk to the works, where for so many years his days had been spent; where for so long a time his thoughts had been thought, his hopes and fears experienced.</s> <s sid="42" id="mary.c36.s42">It was not a cheering feeling to remember that henceforward he was to be severed from all these familiar places; nor were his spirits enlivened by the evident feelings of the majority of those who had been his fellow-workmen.</s> <s sid="43" id="mary.c36.s43">As he stood in the entrance to the foundry, awaiting Mr. Duncombe's leisure, many of those employed in the works passed him on their return from breakfast; and, with one or two exceptions, without any acknowledgment of former acquaintance beyond a distant nod at the utmost.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mary.c36.p23" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="mary.c36.s44"><qs/>"It is hard,"<qe/><sls/> said Jem to himself, with a bitter and indignant feeling rising in his throat, <sle/><qs/>"that let a man's life be what it may, folk are so ready to credit the first word against him.</s> <s sid="45" id="mary.c36.s45">I could live it down if I stayed in England; but then what would not Mary have to bear?</s> <s sid="46" id="mary.c36.s46">Sooner or later the truth would out; and then she would be a show to folk for many a day as John Barton's daughter.</s> <s sid="47" id="mary.c36.s47">Well!</s> <s sid="48" id="mary.c36.s48">God does not judge as hardly as man, that's one comfort for all of us!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mary.c36.p24"><s sid="49" id="mary.c36.s49">Mr. Duncombe did not believe in Jem's guilt, in spite of the silence in which he again this day heard the imputation of it; but he agreed that under the circumstances it was better he should leave the country.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="mary.c36.p25" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="mary.c36.s50"><qs/>"We have been written to by Government, as I think I told you before, to recommend an intelligent man, well acquainted with mechanics, as instrument-maker to the Agricultural College they are establishing at Toronto, in Canada.</s> <s sid="51" id="mary.c36.s51">It is a comfortable appointment,--house,--land,--and a good percentage on the instruments made.</s> <s sid="52" id="mary.c36.s52">I will show you the particulars if I can lay my hand on the letter, which I believe I must have left at home."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="mary.c36.p33"><s sid="71" id="mary.c36.s71">And with his path growing clearer and clearer before him the longer he contemplated it, he went to see Mary, and if he judged it fit, to tell her what he had decided upon.</s> <s sid="72" id="mary.c36.s72">Margaret was sitting with her.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="mary.c36.p42"><s sid="88" id="mary.c36.s88">Meanwhile Jane Wilson had donned her Sunday suit of black, and set off on her errand of condolence.</s> <s sid="89" id="mary.c36.s89">She felt nervous and uneasy at the idea of the moral sayings and texts which she fancied were expected from visitors on occasions like the present; and prepared many a good set speech as she walked towards the house of mourning.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="mary.c36.p43"><s sid="90" id="mary.c36.s90">As she gently opened the door, Mary, sitting idly by the fire, caught a glimpse of her,--of Jem's mother,--of the early friend of her dead parents,--of the kind minister to many a little want in days of childhood,--and rose and came and fell about her neck, with many a sob and moan, saying--</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="mary.c36.p44" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="mary.c36.s91"><qs/>"Oh, he's gone--he's dead--all gone--all dead, and I am left alone!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="mary.c36.p46"><s sid="97" id="mary.c36.s97">Mrs. Wilson was weeping herself long before she had ended this speech, which was so different to all she had planned to say, and from all the formal piety she had laid in store for the visit; for this was heart's piety, and needed no garnish of texts to make it true religion, pure and undefiled.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="mary.c36.p47"><s sid="98" id="mary.c36.s98">They sat together on the same chair, their arms encircling each other; they wept for the same dead; they had the same hope, and trust, and overflowing love in the living.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="mary.c36.p48"><s sid="99" id="mary.c36.s99">From that time forward, hardly a passing cloud dimmed the happy confidence of their intercourse; even by Jem would his mother's temper sooner be irritated than by Mary; before the latter she repressed her occasional nervous ill-humour till the habit of indulging it was perceptibly decreased.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="mary.c36.p49"><s sid="100" id="mary.c36.s100">Years afterwards, in conversation with Jem, he was startled by a chance expression which dropped from his mother's lips; it implied a knowledge of John Barton's crime.</s> <s sid="101" id="mary.c36.s101">It was many a long day since they had seen any Manchester people who could have revealed the secret (if indeed it was known in Manchester, against which Jem had guarded in every possible way).</s> <s sid="102" id="mary.c36.s102">And he was led to inquire first as to the extent, and then as to the source of her knowledge.</s> <s sid="103" id="mary.c36.s103">It was Mary herself who had told all.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="mary.c36.p50"><s sid="104" id="mary.c36.s104">For on the morning to which this chapter principally relates, as Mary sat weeping, and as Mrs. Wilson comforted her by every tenderest word and caress, she revealed, to the dismayed and astonished Jane, the sting of her deep sorrow; the crime which stained her dead father's memory.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="mary.c36.p51"><s sid="105" id="mary.c36.s105">She was quite unconscious that Jem had kept it secret from his mother; she had imagined it bruited abroad as the suspicion against her lover had been; so word after word (dropped from her lips in the supposition that Mrs. Wilson knew all) had told the tale and revealed the cause of her deep anguish; deeper than is ever caused by death alone.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="mary.c36.p52"><s sid="106" id="mary.c36.s106">On large occasions like the present, Mrs. Wilson's innate generosity came out.</s> <s sid="107" id="mary.c36.s107">Her weak and ailing frame imparted its irritation to her conduct in small things, and daily trifles; but she had deep and noble sympathy with great sorrows, and even at the time that Mary spoke she allowed no expression of surprise or horror to escape her lips.</s> <s sid="108" id="mary.c36.s108">She gave way to no curiosity as to the untold details; she was as secret and trustworthy as her son himself; and if in years to come her anger was occasionally excited against Mary, and she, on rare occasions, yielded to ill-temper against her daughter-in-law, she would upbraid her for extravagance, or stinginess, or over-dressing, or under-dressing, or too much mirth or too much gloom, but never, never in her most uncontrolled moments did she allude to any one of the circumstances relating to Mary's flirtation with Harry Carson, or his murderer; and always when she spoke of John Barton, named him with the respect due to his conduct before the last, miserable, guilty month of his life.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="mary.c36.p53"><s sid="109" id="mary.c36.s109">Therefore it came like a blow to Jem, when, after years had passed away, he gathered his mother's knowledge of the whole affair.</s> <s sid="110" id="mary.c36.s110">From the day when he learnt (not without remorse) what hidden depths of self-restraint she had in her soul, his manner to her, always tender and respectful, became reverential; and it was more than ever a loving strife between him and Mary which should most contribute towards the happiness of the declining years of their mother.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="mary.c36.p54"><s sid="111" id="mary.c36.s111">But I am speaking of the events which have occurred only lately, while I have yet many things to tell you that happened six or seven years ago.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="4" id="mary.c37.p4"><s sid="7" id="mary.c37.s7">But now the foundations of his past life were razed to the ground, and the place they had once occupied was sown with salt, to be rebuilt no more for ever.</s> <s sid="8" id="mary.c37.s8">It was like the change from this Life to that other hidden one, when so many of the motives which have actuated all our earthly existence, will have become more fleeting than the shadows of a dream.</s> <s sid="9" id="mary.c37.s9">With a wrench of his soul from the past, so much of which was as nothing, and worse than nothing to him now, Mr. Carson took some hours, after he had witnessed the death of his son's murderer, to consider his situation.</s> </p>
