<p pid="3" id="wh.c1.p3"><s sid="10" id="wh.c1.s10">A nod was the answer.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="wh.c1.p4"><s sid="11" id="wh.c1.s11">'Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir.</s> <s sid="12" id="wh.c1.s12">I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange:</s> <s sid="13" id="wh.c1.s13">I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts - '</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="wh.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="wh.c1.s14"><qs/>'Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,'<qe/> he interrupted, wincing.</s> <s sid="15" id="wh.c1.s15"><qs/>'I should not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it - walk in!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="wh.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="wh.c1.s16">The 'walk in' was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the sentiment, <qs/>'Go to the Deuce:'<qe/> even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathising movement to the words; and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation:</s> <s sid="17" id="wh.c1.s17">I felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="wh.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="wh.c1.s18">When he saw my horse's breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put out his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway, calling, as we entered the court, - <qs/>'Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood's horse; and bring up some wine.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="wh.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="wh.c1.s19"><qs/>'Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,'<qe/> was the reflection suggested by this compound order.</s> <s sid="20" id="wh.c1.s20"><qs/>'No wonder the grass grows up between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge- cutters.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="wh.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="wh.c1.s21">Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man:  very old, perhaps, though hale and sinewy.</s> <s sid="22" id="wh.c1.s22"><qs/>'The Lord help us!'<qe/> he soliloquised in an undertone of peevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime, in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="wh.c1.p10"><s sid="23" id="wh.c1.s23">Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling.</s> <s sid="24" id="wh.c1.s24">'Wuthering' being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.</s> <s sid="25" id="wh.c1.s25">Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed:  one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun.</s> <s sid="26" id="wh.c1.s26">Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong:  the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large jutting stones.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="wh.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="wh.c1.s27">Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys, I detected the date <qs/>'1500,'<qe/><sss/> and the name <sse/><qs/>'Hareton Earnshaw.'<qe/></s> <s sid="28" id="wh.c1.s28">I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="wh.c1.p12"><s sid="29" id="wh.c1.s29">One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any introductory lobby or passage:  they call it here 'the house' pre- eminently.</s> <s sid="30" id="wh.c1.s30">It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter:  at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls.</s> <s sid="31" id="wh.c1.s31">One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof.</s> <s sid="32" id="wh.c1.s32">The latter had never been under-drawn:  its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it.</s> <s sid="33" id="wh.c1.s33">Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge.</s> <s sid="34" id="wh.c1.s34">The floor was of smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green:  one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade.</s> <s sid="35" id="wh.c1.s35">In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="wh.c1.p13"><s sid="36" id="wh.c1.s36">The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance, and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee- breeches and gaiters.</s> <s sid="37" id="wh.c1.s37">Such an individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner.</s> <s sid="38" id="wh.c1.s38">But Mr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living.</s> <s sid="39" id="wh.c1.s39">He is a dark- skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a gentleman:  that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire:  rather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence, because he has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose.</s> <s sid="40" id="wh.c1.s40">Possibly, some people might suspect him of a degree of under-bred pride; I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort:</s> <s sid="41" id="wh.c1.s41">I know, by instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feeling - to manifestations of mutual kindliness.</s> <s sid="42" id="wh.c1.s42">He'll love and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again.</s> <s sid="43" id="wh.c1.s43">No, I'm running on too fast:</s> <s sid="44" id="wh.c1.s44">I bestow my own attributes over-liberally on him.</s> <s sid="45" id="wh.c1.s45">Mr. Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a would-be acquaintance, to those which actuate me.</s> <s sid="46" id="wh.c1.s46">Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="wh.c1.p14"><s sid="47" id="wh.c1.s47">While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature:  a real goddess in my eyes, as long as she took no notice of me.</s> <s sid="48" id="wh.c1.s48">I 'never told my love' vocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears:  she understood me at last, and looked a return - the sweetest of all imaginable looks.</s> <s sid="49" id="wh.c1.s49">And what did I do?</s> <s sid="50" id="wh.c1.s50">I confess it with shame - shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every glance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp.</s> <s sid="51" id="wh.c1.s51">By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness; how undeserved, I alone can appreciate.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="wh.c1.p15"><s sid="52" id="wh.c1.s52">I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and her white teeth watering for a snatch.</s> <s sid="53" id="wh.c1.s53">My caress provoked a long, guttural gnarl.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="wh.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="wh.c1.s54"><qs/>'You'd better let the dog alone,'<qe/> growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison, checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot.</s> <s sid="55" id="wh.c1.s55"><qs/>'She's not accustomed to be spoiled - not kept for a pet.'<qe/></s> <s sid="56" id="wh.c1.s56">Then, striding to a side door, he shouted again, <qs/>'Joseph!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="wh.c1.p17"><s sid="57" id="wh.c1.s57">Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but gave no intimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him, leaving me VIS-A-VIS the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs, who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements.</s> <s sid="58" id="wh.c1.s58">Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but, imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees.</s> <s sid="59" id="wh.c1.s59">I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the table between us.</s> <s sid="60" id="wh.c1.s60">This proceeding aroused the whole hive:  half-a-dozen four-footed fiends, of various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens to the common centre.</s> <s sid="61" id="wh.c1.s61">I felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects of assault; and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker, I was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance from some of the household in re-establishing peace.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="wh.c1.p18"><s sid="62" id="wh.c1.s62">Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm:</s> <s sid="63" id="wh.c1.s63">I don't think they moved one second faster than usual, though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping.</s> <s sid="64" id="wh.c1.s64">Happily, an inhabitant of the kitchen made more despatch:  a lusty dame, with tucked-up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the midst of us flourishing a frying-pan:  and used that weapon, and her tongue, to such purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she only remained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master entered on the scene.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="wh.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="wh.c1.s65"><qs/>'What the devil is the matter?'<qe/> he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure, after this inhospitable treatment.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="wh.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="wh.c1.s66"><qs/>'What the devil, indeed!'<qe/></s> <s sid="67" id="wh.c1.s67">I muttered.</s> <s sid="68" id="wh.c1.s68"><qs/>'The herd of possessed swine could have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours, sir.</s> <s sid="69" id="wh.c1.s69">You might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="wh.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="wh.c1.s70"><qs/>'They won't meddle with persons who touch nothing,'<qe/> he remarked, putting the bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table.</s> <s sid="71" id="wh.c1.s71"><qs/>'The dogs do right to be vigilant.</s> <s sid="72" id="wh.c1.s72">Take a glass of wine?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="wh.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="wh.c1.s73"><qs/>'No, thank you.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="wh.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="wh.c1.s74"><qs/>'Not bitten, are you?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="wh.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="wh.c1.s75"><qs/>'If I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter.'<qe/></s> <s sid="76" id="wh.c1.s76">Heathcliff's countenance relaxed into a grin.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="wh.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="wh.c1.s77"><qs/>'Come, come,'<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>'you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood.</s> <s sid="78" id="wh.c1.s78">Here, take a little wine.</s> <s sid="79" id="wh.c1.s79">Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my dogs, I am willing to own, hardly know how to receive them.</s> <s sid="80" id="wh.c1.s80">Your health, sir?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="wh.c1.p26"><s sid="81" id="wh.c1.s81">I bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides, I felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since his humour took that turn.</s> <s sid="82" id="wh.c1.s82">He - probably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenant - relaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs, and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me, - a discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement.</s> <s sid="83" id="wh.c1.s83">I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and before I went home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit to-morrow.</s> <s sid="84" id="wh.c1.s84">He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion.</s> <s sid="85" id="wh.c1.s85">I shall go, notwithstanding.</s> <s sid="86" id="wh.c1.s86">It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="13" id="wh.c2.p13"><s sid="37" id="wh.c2.s37">I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this second interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of owning my acquaintance.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="wh.c4.p39"><s sid="99" id="wh.c4.s99">He seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to ill- treatment:  he would stand Hindley's blows without winking or shedding a tear, and my pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes, as if he had hurt himself by accident, and nobody was to blame.</s> <s sid="100" id="wh.c4.s100">This endurance made old Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son persecuting the poor fatherless child, as he called him.</s> <s sid="101" id="wh.c4.s101">He took to Heathcliff strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said precious little, and generally the truth), and petting him up far above Cathy, who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="wh.c4.p40"><s sid="102" id="wh.c4.s102">So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house; and at Mrs. Earnshaw's death, which happened in less than two years after, the young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent's affections and his privileges; and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries.</s> <s sid="103" id="wh.c4.s103">I sympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the measles, and I had to tend them, and take on me the cares of a woman at once, I changed my idea.</s> <s sid="104" id="wh.c4.s104">Heathcliff was dangerously sick; and while he lay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow:</s> <s sid="105" id="wh.c4.s105">I suppose he felt I did a good deal for him, and he hadn't wit to guess that I was compelled to do it.</s> <s sid="106" id="wh.c4.s106">However, I will say this, he was the quietest child that ever nurse watched over.</s> <s sid="107" id="wh.c4.s107">The difference between him and the others forced me to be less partial.</s> <s sid="108" id="wh.c4.s108">Cathy and her brother harassed me terribly: he was as uncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not gentleness, made him give little trouble.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="wh.c5.p4"><s sid="16" id="wh.c5.s16">Certainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child take up before; and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener in a day:  from the hour she came down-stairs till the hour she went to bed, we had not a minute's security that she wouldn't be in mischief.</s> <s sid="17" id="wh.c5.s17">Her spirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue always going - singing, laughing, and plaguing everybody who would not do the same.</s> <s sid="18" id="wh.c5.s18">A wild, wicked slip she was - but she had the bonniest eye, the sweetest smile, and lightest foot in the parish:  and, after all, I believe she meant no harm; for when once she made you cry in good earnest, it seldom happened that she would not keep you company, and oblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her.</s> <s sid="19" id="wh.c5.s19">She was much too fond of Heathcliff.</s> <s sid="20" id="wh.c5.s20">The greatest punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him:  yet she got chided more than any of us on his account.</s> <s sid="21" id="wh.c5.s21">In play, she liked exceedingly to act the little mistress; using her hands freely, and commanding her companions:  she did so to me, but I would not bear slapping and ordering; and so I let her know.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="wh.c5.p5" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="wh.c5.s22">Now, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children:  he had always been strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on her part, had no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing condition than he was in his prime.</s> <s sid="23" id="wh.c5.s23">His peevish reproofs wakened in her a naughty delight to provoke him:  she was never so happy as when we were all scolding her at once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy look, and her ready words; turning Joseph's religious curses into ridicule, baiting me, and doing just what her father hated most - showing how her pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over Heathcliff than his kindness:  how the boy would do HER bidding in anything, and HIS only when it suited his own inclination.</s> <s sid="24" id="wh.c5.s24">After behaving as badly as possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to make it up at night.</s> <s sid="25" id="wh.c5.s25"><qs/>'Nay, Cathy,'<qe/><sls/> the old man would say, <sle/><qs/>'I cannot love thee, thou'rt worse than thy brother.</s> <s sid="26" id="wh.c5.s26">Go, say thy prayers, child, and ask God's pardon.</s> <s sid="27" id="wh.c5.s27">I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever reared thee!'<qe/></s> <s sid="28" id="wh.c5.s28">That made her cry, at first; and then being repulsed continually hardened her, and she laughed if I told her to say she was sorry for her faults, and beg to be forgiven.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="wh.c5.p7" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="wh.c5.s41"><qs/>'I shall bid father good-night first,'<qe/> said Catherine, putting her arms round his neck, before we could hinder her.</s> <s sid="42" id="wh.c5.s42">The poor thing discovered her loss directly - she screamed out - <qs/>'Oh, he's dead, Heathcliff! he's dead!'<qe/></s> <s sid="43" id="wh.c5.s43">And they both set up a heart-breaking cry.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="wh.c15.p2"><s sid="5" id="wh.c15.s5">In the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I knew, as well as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place; and I shunned going out, because I still carried his letter in my pocket, and didn't want to be threatened or teased any more.</s> <s sid="6" id="wh.c15.s6">I had made up my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not guess how its receipt would affect Catherine.</s> <s sid="7" id="wh.c15.s7">The consequence was, that it did not reach her before the lapse of three days.</s> <s sid="8" id="wh.c15.s8">The fourth was Sunday, and I brought it into her room after the family were gone to church.</s> <s sid="9" id="wh.c15.s9">There was a manservant left to keep the house with me, and we generally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of service; but on that occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that I set them wide open, and, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would be coming, I told my companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges, and he must run over to the village and get a few, to be paid for on the morrow.</s> <s sid="10" id="wh.c15.s10">He departed, and I went up-stairs.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="wh.c22.p2"><s sid="3" id="wh.c22.s3">Poor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been considerably sadder and duller since its abandonment; and her father insisted on her reading less, and taking more exercise.</s> <s sid="4" id="wh.c22.s4">She had his companionship no longer; I esteemed it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible, with mine:  an inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two or three hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow her footsteps, and then my society was obviously less desirable than his.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="wh.c25.p12"><s sid="50" id="wh.c25.s50">Edgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his request; because he could not accompany Catherine.</s> <s sid="51" id="wh.c25.s51">He said, in summer, perhaps, they might meet:  meantime, he wished him to continue writing at intervals, and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was able by letter; being well aware of his hard position in his family.</s> <s sid="52" id="wh.c25.s52">Linton complied; and had he been unrestrained, would probably have spoiled all by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations. but his father kept a sharp watch over him; and, of course, insisted on every line that my master sent being shown; so, instead of penning his peculiar personal sufferings and distresses, the themes constantly uppermost in his thoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of being held asunder from his friend and love; and gently intimated that Mr. Linton must allow an interview soon, or he should fear he was purposely deceiving him with empty promises.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="wh.c25.p13"><s sid="53" id="wh.c25.s53">Cathy was a powerful ally at home; and between them they at length persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk together about once a week, under my guardianship, and on the moors nearest the Grange:  for June found him still declining.</s> <s sid="54" id="wh.c25.s54">Though he had set aside yearly a portion of his income for my young lady's fortune, he had a natural desire that she might retain - or at least return in a short time to - the house of her ancestors; and he considered her only prospect of doing that was by a union with his heir; he had no idea that the latter was failing almost as fast as himself; nor had any one, I believe:  no doctor visited the Heights, and no one saw Master Heathcliff to make report of his condition among us.</s> <s sid="55" id="wh.c25.s55">I, for my part, began to fancy my forebodings were false, and that he must be actually rallying, when he mentioned riding and walking on the moors, and seemed so earnest in pursuing his object.</s> <s sid="56" id="wh.c25.s56">I could not picture a father treating a dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards learned Heathcliff had treated him, to compel this apparent eagerness:  his efforts redoubling the more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened with defeat by death.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="5" id="wh.c26.p5"><s sid="11" id="wh.c26.s11">Catherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment:  she changed the ejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm; and the congratulation on their long-postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he were worse than usual?</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="wh.c26.p6" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="wh.c26.s12"><qs/>'No - better - better!'<qe/> he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if he needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over her; the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the languid expression they once possessed.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="wh.c26.p7" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="wh.c26.s13"><qs/>'But you have been worse,'<qe/> persisted his cousin; 'worse than when I saw you last; you are thinner, and - '</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="wh.c26.p9"><s sid="17" id="wh.c26.s17">Badly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside her.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="wh.c26.p10" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="wh.c26.s18"><qs/>'This is something like your paradise,'<qe/> said she, making an effort at cheerfulness.</s> <s sid="19" id="wh.c26.s19"><qs/>'You recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the place and way each thought pleasantest?</s> <s sid="20" id="wh.c26.s20">This is nearly yours, only there are clouds; but then they are so soft and mellow:  it is nicer than sunshine.</s> <s sid="21" id="wh.c26.s21">Next week, if you can, we'll ride down to the Grange Park, and try mine.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="wh.c26.p12" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="wh.c26.s29"><qs/>'But I think,'<qe/><sss/> said Cathy, <sse/><qs/>'you'd be more comfortable at home than sitting here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and songs, and chatter:  you have grown wiser than I, in these six months; you have little taste for my diversions now:  or else, if I could amuse you, I'd willingly stay.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="wh.c26.p13" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="wh.c26.s30"><qs/>'Stay to rest yourself,'<qe/> he replied.</s> <s sid="31" id="wh.c26.s31"><qs/>'And, Catherine, don't think or say that I'm VERY unwell:  it is the heavy weather and heat that make me dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me.</s> <s sid="32" id="wh.c26.s32">Tell uncle I'm in tolerable health, will you?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="wh.c26.p15" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="wh.c26.s35"><qs/>'And be here again next Thursday,'<qe/> continued he, shunning her puzzled gaze.</s> <s sid="36" id="wh.c26.s36"><qs/>'And give him my thanks for permitting you to come - my best thanks, Catherine.</s> <s sid="37" id="wh.c26.s37">And - and, if you DID meet my father, and he asked you about me, don't lead him to suppose that I've been extremely silent and stupid:  don't look sad and downcast, as you are doing - he'll be angry.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="wh.c26.p16" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="wh.c26.s38"><qs/>'I care nothing for his anger,'<qe/> exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be its object.</s> </p>
