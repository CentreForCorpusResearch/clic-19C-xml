<p pid="1" id="pride.c3.p1"><s sid="1" id="pride.c3.s1">Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.</s> <s sid="2" id="pride.c3.s2">They attacked him in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas.</s> <s sid="3" id="pride.c3.s3">Her report was highly favourable.</s> <s sid="4" id="pride.c3.s4">Sir William had been delighted with him.</s> <s sid="5" id="pride.c3.s5">He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.</s> <s sid="6" id="pride.c3.s6">Nothing could be more delightful!</s> <s sid="7" id="pride.c3.s7">To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="pride.c3.p2" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="pride.c3.s8"><qs/>"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"<qe/><sls/> said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, <sle/><qs/>"and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="pride.c3.p3"><s sid="9" id="pride.c3.s9">In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.</s> <s sid="10" id="pride.c3.s10">He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.</s> <s sid="11" id="pride.c3.s11">The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="pride.c3.p4"><s sid="12" id="pride.c3.s12">An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.</s> <s sid="13" id="pride.c3.s13">Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc.</s> <s sid="14" id="pride.c3.s14">Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.</s> <s sid="15" id="pride.c3.s15">She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.</s> <s sid="16" id="pride.c3.s16">Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.</s> <s sid="17" id="pride.c3.s17">The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin.</s> <s sid="18" id="pride.c3.s18">And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="pride.c3.p6"><s sid="23" id="pride.c3.s23">Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.</s> <s sid="24" id="pride.c3.s24">Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.</s> <s sid="25" id="pride.c3.s25">What a contrast between him and his friend!</s> <s sid="26" id="pride.c3.s26">Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.</s> <s sid="27" id="pride.c3.s27">His character was decided.</s> <s sid="28" id="pride.c3.s28">He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.</s> <s sid="29" id="pride.c3.s29">Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="pride.c3.p7"><s sid="30" id="pride.c3.s30">Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="pride.c11.p2" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="pride.c11.s4">But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.</s> <s sid="5" id="pride.c11.s5">He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was <qs/>"very glad;"<qe/> but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.</s> <s sid="6" id="pride.c11.s6">He was full of joy and attention.</s> <s sid="7" id="pride.c11.s7">The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door.</s> <s sid="8" id="pride.c11.s8">He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.</s> <s sid="9" id="pride.c11.s9">Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="pride.c11.p3"><s sid="10" id="pride.c11.s10">When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain.</s> <s sid="11" id="pride.c11.s11">She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.</s> <s sid="12" id="pride.c11.s12">She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her.</s> <s sid="13" id="pride.c11.s13">Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.</s> <s sid="14" id="pride.c11.s14">Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="pride.c11.p4" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="pride.c11.s15">Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.</s> <s sid="16" id="pride.c11.s16">She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.</s> <s sid="17" id="pride.c11.s17">At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, <qs/>"How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way!</s> <s sid="18" id="pride.c11.s18">I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!</s> <s sid="19" id="pride.c11.s19">How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book!</s> <s sid="20" id="pride.c11.s20">When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="pride.c11.p5"><s sid="21" id="pride.c11.s21">No one made any reply.</s> <s sid="22" id="pride.c11.s22">She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="pride.c11.p6" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="pride.c11.s23"><qs/>"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?</s> <s sid="24" id="pride.c11.s24">I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="pride.c11.p7" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="pride.c11.s25"><qs/>"If you mean Darcy,"<qe/><sss/> cried her brother, <sse/><qs/>"he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="pride.c11.p8" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="pride.c11.s26"><qs/>"I should like balls infinitely better,"<qe/><sss/> she replied, <sse/><qs/>"if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.</s> <s sid="27" id="pride.c11.s27">It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="pride.c11.p9" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="pride.c11.s28"><qs/>"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="pride.c11.p10"><s sid="29" id="pride.c11.s29">Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room.</s> <s sid="30" id="pride.c11.s30">Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.</s> <s sid="31" id="pride.c11.s31">In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="pride.c11.p13" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="pride.c11.s40"><qs/>"Not at all,"<qe/><sss/> was her answer; <sse/><qs/>"but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="pride.c11.p14"><s sid="41" id="pride.c11.s41">Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="pride.c12.p1"><s sid="1" id="pride.c12.s1">In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.</s> <s sid="2" id="pride.c12.s2">But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before.</s> <s sid="3" id="pride.c12.s3">Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.</s> <s sid="4" id="pride.c12.s4">Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.</s> <s sid="5" id="pride.c12.s5">Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="pride.c12.p2"><s sid="6" id="pride.c12.s6">The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.</s> <s sid="7" id="pride.c12.s7">Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="pride.c12.p3"><s sid="8" id="pride.c12.s8">The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="pride.c12.p4"><s sid="9" id="pride.c12.s9">To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough.</s> <s sid="10" id="pride.c12.s10">She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.</s> <s sid="11" id="pride.c12.s11">He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.</s> <s sid="12" id="pride.c12.s12">Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="pride.c12.p5"><s sid="13" id="pride.c12.s13">On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place.</s> <s sid="14" id="pride.c12.s14">Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.</s> <s sid="15" id="pride.c12.s15">Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="pride.c12.p6"><s sid="16" id="pride.c12.s16">They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.</s> <s sid="17" id="pride.c12.s17">Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.</s> <s sid="18" id="pride.c12.s18">But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.</s> <s sid="19" id="pride.c12.s19">The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="pride.c12.p7"><s sid="20" id="pride.c12.s20">They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to.</s> <s sid="21" id="pride.c12.s21">Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort.</s> <s sid="22" id="pride.c12.s22">Much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="1" id="pride.c16.p1"><s sid="1" id="pride.c16.s1">As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="pride.c16.p2"><s sid="2" id="pride.c16.s2">When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="pride.c16.p3"><s sid="3" id="pride.c16.s3">In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.</s> <s sid="4" id="pride.c16.s4">To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.</s> <s sid="5" id="pride.c16.s5">It was over at last, however.</s> <s sid="6" id="pride.c16.s6">The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.</s> <s sid="7" id="pride.c16.s7">The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="pride.c16.p4"><s sid="8" id="pride.c16.s8">Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="pride.c16.p5"><s sid="9" id="pride.c16.s9">With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.</s> <s sid="10" id="pride.c16.s10">When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="pride.c30.p1"><s sid="1" id="pride.c30.s1">Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with.</s> <s sid="2" id="pride.c30.s2">While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room, which fronted the road.</s> <s sid="3" id="pride.c30.s3">The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.</s> <s sid="4" id="pride.c30.s4">Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="pride.c30.p2"><s sid="5" id="pride.c30.s5">From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.</s> <s sid="6" id="pride.c30.s6">She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="pride.c30.p3"><s sid="7" id="pride.c30.s7">Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.</s> <s sid="8" id="pride.c30.s8">Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.</s> <s sid="9" id="pride.c30.s9">She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="pride.c30.p4"><s sid="10" id="pride.c30.s10">Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="pride.c30.p5"><s sid="11" id="pride.c30.s11">The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first.</s> <s sid="12" id="pride.c30.s12">Their other engagements were few, as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach.</s> <s sid="13" id="pride.c30.s13">This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.</s> <s sid="14" id="pride.c30.s14">Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="pride.c30.p6"><s sid="15" id="pride.c30.s15">In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.</s> <s sid="16" id="pride.c30.s16">Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.</s> <s sid="17" id="pride.c30.s17">Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="pride.c30.p7"><s sid="18" id="pride.c30.s18">His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence.</s> <s sid="19" id="pride.c30.s19">On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.</s> <s sid="20" id="pride.c30.s20">There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentleman accompanied him.</s> <s sid="21" id="pride.c30.s21">Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="pride.c30.p9"><s sid="24" id="pride.c30.s24">Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.</s> <s sid="25" id="pride.c30.s25">Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.</s> <s sid="26" id="pride.c30.s26">Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.</s> <s sid="27" id="pride.c30.s27">Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="pride.c30.p10"><s sid="28" id="pride.c30.s28">Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.</s> <s sid="29" id="pride.c30.s29">At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.</s> <s sid="30" id="pride.c30.s30">She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added:</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="pride.c30.p11" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="pride.c30.s31"><qs/>"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.</s> <s sid="32" id="pride.c30.s32">Have you never happened to see her there?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="pride.c30.p12"><s sid="33" id="pride.c30.s33">She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.</s> <s sid="34" id="pride.c30.s34">The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="1" id="pride.c31.p1"><s sid="1" id="pride.c31.s1">Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings.</s> <s sid="2" id="pride.c31.s2">It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.</s> <s sid="3" id="pride.c31.s3">For the last week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter.</s> <s sid="4" id="pride.c31.s4">Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at church.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="pride.c31.p2"><s sid="5" id="pride.c31.s5">The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room.</s> <s sid="6" id="pride.c31.s6">Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="pride.c31.p3"><s sid="7" id="pride.c31.s7">Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.</s> <s sid="8" id="pride.c31.s8">He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy.</s> <s sid="9" id="pride.c31.s9">_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out:</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="pride.c36.p2" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="pride.c36.s10">But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.</s> <s sid="11" id="pride.c36.s11">Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.</s> <s sid="12" id="pride.c36.s12">She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, <qs/>"This must be false!</s> <s sid="13" id="pride.c36.s13">This cannot be!</s> <s sid="14" id="pride.c36.s14">This must be the grossest falsehood!"<qe/>--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="pride.c39.p18"><s sid="63" id="pride.c39.s63">With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.</s> <s sid="64" id="pride.c39.s64">Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="pride.c39.p23" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="pride.c39.s77">To this Mary very gravely replied, <qs/>"Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures!</s> <s sid="78" id="pride.c39.s78">They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.</s> <s sid="79" id="pride.c39.s79">But I confess they would have no charms for _me_--I should infinitely prefer a book."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="pride.c39.p24"><s sid="80" id="pride.c39.s80">But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.</s> <s sid="81" id="pride.c39.s81">She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="pride.c39.p25"><s sid="82" id="pride.c39.s82">In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.</s> <s sid="83" id="pride.c39.s83">It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.</s> <s sid="84" id="pride.c39.s84">There was another reason too for her opposition.</s> <s sid="85" id="pride.c39.s85">She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.</s> <s sid="86" id="pride.c39.s86">The comfort to _her_ of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression.</s> <s sid="87" id="pride.c39.s87">In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="pride.c39.p26"><s sid="88" id="pride.c39.s88">She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.</s> <s sid="89" id="pride.c39.s89">Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="2" id="pride.c42.p2"><s sid="8" id="pride.c42.s8">Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband.</s> <s sid="9" id="pride.c42.s9">She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.</s> <s sid="10" id="pride.c42.s10">But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="pride.c44.p4"><s sid="14" id="pride.c44.s14">Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful.</s> <s sid="15" id="pride.c44.s15">She was less handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.</s> <s sid="16" id="pride.c44.s16">Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="pride.c44.p10"><s sid="38" id="pride.c44.s38">It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.</s> <s sid="39" id="pride.c44.s39">When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.</s> <s sid="40" id="pride.c44.s40">Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="pride.c44.p13"><s sid="48" id="pride.c44.s48">But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication.</s> <s sid="49" id="pride.c44.s49">It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.</s> <s sid="50" id="pride.c44.s50">They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="pride.c44.p14"><s sid="51" id="pride.c44.s51">Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.</s> <s sid="52" id="pride.c44.s52">They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy.</s> <s sid="53" id="pride.c44.s53">There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected.</s> <s sid="54" id="pride.c44.s54">Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight.</s> <s sid="55" id="pride.c44.s55">They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit.</s> <s sid="56" id="pride.c44.s56">It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="pride.c44.p15"><s sid="57" id="pride.c44.s57">With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="pride.c44.p16"><s sid="58" id="pride.c44.s58">As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out.</s> <s sid="59" id="pride.c44.s59">She certainly did not hate him.</s> <s sid="60" id="pride.c44.s60">No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called.</s> <s sid="61" id="pride.c44.s61">The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced.</s> <s sid="62" id="pride.c44.s62">But above all, above respect and esteem, there was  a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.</s> <s sid="63" id="pride.c44.s63">It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.</s> <s sid="64" id="pride.c44.s64">He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.</s> <s sid="65" id="pride.c44.s65">Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.</s> <s sid="66" id="pride.c44.s66">She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="pride.c44.p17"><s sid="67" id="pride.c44.s67">It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.</s> <s sid="68" id="pride.c44.s68">They were, therefore, to go.</s> <s sid="69" id="pride.c44.s69">Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="pride.c57.p1"><s sid="1" id="pride.c57.s1">The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.</s> <s sid="2" id="pride.c57.s2">Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy.</s> <s sid="3" id="pride.c57.s3">It was a rational scheme, to be sure!  but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea.</s> <s sid="4" id="pride.c57.s4">She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.</s> <s sid="5" id="pride.c57.s5">And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady Catherine), had only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="pride.c57.p2"><s sid="6" id="pride.c57.s6">In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.</s> <s sid="7" id="pride.c57.s7">From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.</s> <s sid="8" id="pride.c57.s8">She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.</s> <s sid="9" id="pride.c57.s9">With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="pride.c57.p3"><s sid="10" id="pride.c57.s10">If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him.</s> <s sid="11" id="pride.c57.s11">In that case he would return no more.</s> <s sid="12" id="pride.c57.s12">Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="pride.c61.p1"><s sid="1" id="pride.c61.s1">Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.</s> <s sid="2" id="pride.c61.s2">With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed.</s> <s sid="3" id="pride.c61.s3">I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="pride.c61.p2"><s sid="4" id="pride.c61.s4">Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do.</s> <s sid="5" id="pride.c61.s5">He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="pride.c61.p3"><s sid="6" id="pride.c61.s6">Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.</s> <s sid="7" id="pride.c61.s7">So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.</s> <s sid="8" id="pride.c61.s8">The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="pride.c61.p4"><s sid="9" id="pride.c61.s9">Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.</s> <s sid="10" id="pride.c61.s10">In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great.</s> <s sid="11" id="pride.c61.s11">She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.</s> <s sid="12" id="pride.c61.s12">From the further disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="pride.c61.p5"><s sid="13" id="pride.c61.s13">Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone.</s> <s sid="14" id="pride.c61.s14">Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="pride.c61.p6"><s sid="15" id="pride.c61.s15">As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters.</s> <s sid="16" id="pride.c61.s16">He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.</s> <s sid="17" id="pride.c61.s17">The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.</s> <s sid="18" id="pride.c61.s18">The letter was to this effect:</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="pride.c61.p11"><s sid="32" id="pride.c61.s32">Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession.</s> <s sid="33" id="pride.c61.s33">Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="pride.c61.p12"><s sid="34" id="pride.c61.s34">Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="pride.c61.p13"><s sid="35" id="pride.c61.s35">Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.</s> <s sid="36" id="pride.c61.s36">They were able to love each other even as well as they intended.</s> <s sid="37" id="pride.c61.s37">Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother.</s> <s sid="38" id="pride.c61.s38">He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.</s> <s sid="39" id="pride.c61.s39">Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.</s> <s sid="40" id="pride.c61.s40">By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="pride.c61.p14"><s sid="41" id="pride.c61.s41">Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.</s> <s sid="42" id="pride.c61.s42">But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="pride.c61.p15"><s sid="43" id="pride.c61.s43">With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.</s> <s sid="44" id="pride.c61.s44">Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.</s> </p></div>
