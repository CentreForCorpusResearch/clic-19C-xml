<title>CHAPTER I</title>

<p pid="1" id="emma.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="emma.c1.s1">Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="emma.c1.s2">She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage, been mistress of his house from a very early period.</s> <s sid="3" id="emma.c1.s3">Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c1.p3"><s sid="4" id="emma.c1.s4">Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of Emma.</s> <s sid="5" id="emma.c1.s5">Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters.</s> <s sid="6" id="emma.c1.s6">Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c1.p4"><s sid="7" id="emma.c1.s7">The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments.</s> <s sid="8" id="emma.c1.s8">The danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c1.p5"><s sid="9" id="emma.c1.s9">Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married.</s> <s sid="10" id="emma.c1.s10">It was Miss Taylor's loss which first brought grief.</s> <s sid="11" id="emma.c1.s11">It was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance.</s> <s sid="12" id="emma.c1.s12">The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening.</s> <s sid="13" id="emma.c1.s13">Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c1.p6"><s sid="14" id="emma.c1.s14">The event had every promise of happiness for her friend.</s> <s sid="15" id="emma.c1.s15">Mr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her.</s> <s sid="16" id="emma.c1.s16">The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.</s> <s sid="17" id="emma.c1.s17">She recalled her past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen years--how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old--how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health--and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood.</s> <s sid="18" id="emma.c1.s18">A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.</s> <s sid="19" id="emma.c1.s19">She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="emma.c1.p7"><s sid="20" id="emma.c1.s20">How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude.</s> <s sid="21" id="emma.c1.s21">She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.</s> <s sid="22" id="emma.c1.s22">He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="emma.c1.p8"><s sid="23" id="emma.c1.s23">The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits; for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="emma.c1.p9"><s sid="24" id="emma.c1.s24">Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house, and give her pleasant society again.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="emma.c1.p10"><s sid="25" id="emma.c1.s25">Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town, to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals.</s> <s sid="26" id="emma.c1.s26">The Woodhouses were first in consequence there.</s> <s sid="27" id="emma.c1.s27">All looked up to them.</s> <s sid="28" id="emma.c1.s28">She had many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day.</s> <s sid="29" id="emma.c1.s29">It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.</s> <s sid="30" id="emma.c1.s30">His spirits required support.</s> <s sid="31" id="emma.c1.s31">He was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.</s> <s sid="32" id="emma.c1.s32">Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.</s> <s sid="33" id="emma.c1.s33">Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="emma.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="emma.c1.s34"><qs/>"Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again.</s> <s sid="35" id="emma.c1.s35">What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="emma.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="emma.c1.s36"><qs/>"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot.</s> <s sid="37" id="emma.c1.s37">Mr. Weston is such a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="emma.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="emma.c1.s38"><qs/>"A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own?</s> <s sid="39" id="emma.c1.s39">This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours, my dear."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="emma.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="emma.c1.s40"><qs/>"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!--We shall be always meeting!</s> <s sid="41" id="emma.c1.s41">_We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="emma.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="emma.c1.s42"><qs/>"My dear, how am I to get so far?</s> <s sid="43" id="emma.c1.s43">Randalls is such a distance.</s> <s sid="44" id="emma.c1.s44">I could not walk half so far."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="emma.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="emma.c1.s45"><qs/>"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking.</s> <s sid="46" id="emma.c1.s46">We must go in the carriage, to be sure."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="emma.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="emma.c1.s47"><qs/>"The carriage!</s> <s sid="48" id="emma.c1.s48">But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="emma.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="emma.c1.s49"><qs/>"They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa.</s> <s sid="50" id="emma.c1.s50">You know we have settled all that already.</s> <s sid="51" id="emma.c1.s51">We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night.</s> <s sid="52" id="emma.c1.s52">And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there.</s> <s sid="53" id="emma.c1.s53">I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.</s> <s sid="54" id="emma.c1.s54">That was your doing, papa.</s> <s sid="55" id="emma.c1.s55">You got Hannah that good place.</s> <s sid="56" id="emma.c1.s56">Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her--James is so obliged to you!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="emma.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="emma.c1.s57"><qs/>"I am very glad I did think of her.</s> <s sid="58" id="emma.c1.s58">It was very lucky, for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her.</s> <s sid="59" id="emma.c1.s59">Whenever I see her, she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it.</s> <s sid="60" id="emma.c1.s60">I am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see.</s> <s sid="61" id="emma.c1.s61">Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us.</s> <s sid="62" id="emma.c1.s62">He will be able to tell her how we all are."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="emma.c1.p20"><s sid="63" id="emma.c1.s63">Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own.</s> <s sid="64" id="emma.c1.s64">The backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="emma.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="emma.c1.s65">Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband.</s> <s sid="66" id="emma.c1.s66">He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.</s> <s sid="67" id="emma.c1.s67">He had returned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square.</s> <s sid="68" id="emma.c1.s68">It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time.</s> <s sid="69" id="emma.c1.s69">Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good; and his many inquiries after "poor Isabella" and her children were answered most satisfactorily.</s> <s sid="70" id="emma.c1.s70">When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse gratefully observed, <qs/>"It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come out at this late hour to call upon us.</s> <s sid="71" id="emma.c1.s71">I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="emma.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="emma.c1.s72"><qs/>"Not at all, sir.</s> <s sid="73" id="emma.c1.s73">It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="emma.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="emma.c1.s74"><qs/>"But you must have found it very damp and dirty.</s> <s sid="75" id="emma.c1.s75">I wish you may not catch cold."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="emma.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="emma.c1.s76"><qs/>"Dirty, sir!</s> <s sid="77" id="emma.c1.s77">Look at my shoes.</s> <s sid="78" id="emma.c1.s78">Not a speck on them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="emma.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="emma.c1.s79"><qs/>"Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain here.</s> <s sid="80" id="emma.c1.s80">It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast.</s> <s sid="81" id="emma.c1.s81">I wanted them to put off the wedding."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="emma.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="emma.c1.s82"><qs/>"By the bye--I have not wished you joy.</s> <s sid="83" id="emma.c1.s83">Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well.</s> <s sid="84" id="emma.c1.s84">How did you all behave?</s> <s sid="85" id="emma.c1.s85">Who cried most?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="emma.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="emma.c1.s86"><qs/>"Ah! poor Miss Taylor!</s> <s sid="87" id="emma.c1.s87">'Tis a sad business."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="emma.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="emma.c1.s88"><qs/>"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say `poor Miss Taylor.'</s> <s sid="89" id="emma.c1.s89">I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="emma.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="emma.c1.s90"><qs/>"Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!"<qe/> said Emma playfully.</s> <s sid="91" id="emma.c1.s91"><qs/>"That is what you have in your head, I know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="emma.c1.p30" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="emma.c1.s92"><qs/>"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,"<qe/> said Mr. Woodhouse, with a sigh.</s> <s sid="93" id="emma.c1.s93"><qs/>"I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="emma.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="emma.c1.s94"><qs/>"My dearest papa!</s> <s sid="95" id="emma.c1.s95">You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean _you_.</s> <s sid="96" id="emma.c1.s96">What a horrible idea!</s> <s sid="97" id="emma.c1.s97">Oh no!</s> <s sid="98" id="emma.c1.s98">I meant only myself.</s> <s sid="99" id="emma.c1.s99">Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know-- in a joke--it is all a joke.</s> <s sid="100" id="emma.c1.s100">We always say what we like to one another."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="emma.c1.p32"><s sid="101" id="emma.c1.s101">Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="emma.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="102" id="emma.c1.s102"><qs/>"Emma knows I never flatter her,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Knightley, <sse/><qs/>"but I meant no reflection on any body.</s> <s sid="103" id="emma.c1.s103">Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please; she will now have but one.</s> <s sid="104" id="emma.c1.s104">The chances are that she must be a gainer."<qe/></s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER II</title>

<p pid="1" id="emma.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="emma.c2.s1">Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family, which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property.</s> <s sid="2" id="emma.c2.s2">He had received a good education, but, on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c2.p2"><s sid="3" id="emma.c2.s3">Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c2.p3"><s sid="4" id="emma.c2.s4">Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off with due decorum.</s> <s sid="5" id="emma.c2.s5">It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much happiness.</s> <s sid="6" id="emma.c2.s6">Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best.</s> <s sid="7" id="emma.c2.s7">She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.</s> <s sid="8" id="emma.c2.s8">They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c2.p4"><s sid="9" id="emma.c2.s9">Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills, as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage, he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.</s> <s sid="10" id="emma.c2.s10">From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.</s> <s sid="11" id="emma.c2.s11">The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease.</s> <s sid="12" id="emma.c2.s12">Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c2.p5"><s sid="13" id="emma.c2.s13">A complete change of life became desirable.</s> <s sid="14" id="emma.c2.s14">He quitted the militia and engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in London, which afforded him a favourable opening.</s> <s sid="15" id="emma.c2.s15">It was a concern which brought just employment enough.</s> <s sid="16" id="emma.c2.s16">He had still a small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away.</s> <s sid="17" id="emma.c2.s17">He had, by that time, realised an easy competence--enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for--enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c2.p6"><s sid="18" id="emma.c2.s18">It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were accomplished.</s> <s sid="19" id="emma.c2.s19">He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through.</s> <s sid="20" id="emma.c2.s20">He had never been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="emma.c2.p7"><s sid="21" id="emma.c2.s21">He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age.</s> <s sid="22" id="emma.c2.s22">It was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his father's assistance.</s> <s sid="23" id="emma.c2.s23">His father had no apprehension of it.</s> <s sid="24" id="emma.c2.s24">The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed, so deservedly dear.</s> <s sid="25" id="emma.c2.s25">He saw his son every year in London, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too.</s> <s sid="26" id="emma.c2.s26">He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="emma.c2.p8"><s sid="27" id="emma.c2.s27">Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life.</s> <s sid="28" id="emma.c2.s28">His coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="emma.c2.p9" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="emma.c2.s29">Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place.</s> <s sid="30" id="emma.c2.s30">There was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit.</s> <s sid="31" id="emma.c2.s31">Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion.</s> <s sid="32" id="emma.c2.s32">For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.</s> <s sid="33" id="emma.c2.s33"><qs/>"I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston?</s> <s sid="34" id="emma.c2.s34">I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed.</s> <s sid="35" id="emma.c2.s35">Mr. Woodhouse told me of it.</s> <s sid="36" id="emma.c2.s36">Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="emma.c2.p10"><s sid="37" id="emma.c2.s37">It was, indeed, a highly prized letter.</s> <s sid="38" id="emma.c2.s38">Mrs. Weston had, of course, formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured.</s> <s sid="39" id="emma.c2.s39">She felt herself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="emma.c2.p11"><s sid="40" id="emma.c2.s40">She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour's ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations.</s> <s sid="41" id="emma.c2.s41">And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's disposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="emma.c2.p12" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="emma.c2.s42">Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction--her more than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity `poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own.</s> <s sid="43" id="emma.c2.s43">But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh, and saying, <qs/>"Ah, poor Miss Taylor!</s> <s sid="44" id="emma.c2.s44">She would be very glad to stay."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="emma.c2.p13"><s sid="45" id="emma.c2.s45">There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.</s> <s sid="46" id="emma.c2.s46">The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him, was all eat up.</s> <s sid="47" id="emma.c2.s47">His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be different from himself.</s> <s sid="48" id="emma.c2.s48">What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it.</s> <s sid="49" id="emma.c2.s49">He had been at the pains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject.</s> <s sid="50" id="emma.c2.s50">Mr. Perry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to, he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately.</s> <s sid="51" id="emma.c2.s51">With such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="emma.c2.p14"><s sid="52" id="emma.c2.s52">There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it.</s> </p></div>

<title>CHAPTER III</title>

<p pid="1" id="emma.c3.p1"><s sid="1" id="emma.c3.s1">Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way.</s> <s sid="2" id="emma.c3.s2">He liked very much to have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked.</s> <s sid="3" id="emma.c3.s3">He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms.</s> <s sid="4" id="emma.c3.s4">Fortunately for him, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many such.</s> <s sid="5" id="emma.c3.s5">Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card-table for him.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c3.p2"><s sid="6" id="emma.c3.s6">Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c3.p3"><s sid="7" id="emma.c3.s7">After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses.</s> <s sid="8" id="emma.c3.s8">Had it taken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c3.p4"><s sid="9" id="emma.c3.s9">Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille.</s> <s sid="10" id="emma.c3.s10">She lived with her single daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward circumstances, can excite.</s> <s sid="11" id="emma.c3.s11">Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.</s> <s sid="12" id="emma.c3.s12">Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect.</s> <s sid="13" id="emma.c3.s13">She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness.</s> <s sid="14" id="emma.c3.s14">Her youth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible.</s> <s sid="15" id="emma.c3.s15">And yet she was a happy woman, and a woman whom no one named without good-will.</s> <s sid="16" id="emma.c3.s16">It was her own universal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders.</s> <s sid="17" id="emma.c3.s17">She loved every body, was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing.</s> <s sid="18" id="emma.c3.s18">The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to herself.</s> <s sid="19" id="emma.c3.s19">She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c3.p5"><s sid="20" id="emma.c3.s20">Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary, or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality, upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies.</s> <s sid="21" id="emma.c3.s21">Mrs. Goddard's school was in high repute--and very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands.</s> <s sid="22" id="emma.c3.s22">It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church.</s> <s sid="23" id="emma.c3.s23">She was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c3.p6"><s sid="24" id="emma.c3.s24">These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect; and happy was she, for her father's sake, in the power; though, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston.</s> <s sid="25" id="emma.c3.s25">She was delighted to see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="emma.c3.p7"><s sid="26" id="emma.c3.s26">As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of her beauty.</s> <s sid="27" id="emma.c3.s27">A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="emma.c3.p8"><s sid="28" id="emma.c3.s28">Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody.</s> <s sid="29" id="emma.c3.s29">Somebody had placed her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder.</s> <s sid="30" id="emma.c3.s30">This was all that was generally known of her history.</s> <s sid="31" id="emma.c3.s31">She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="emma.c3.p9"><s sid="32" id="emma.c3.s32">She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired.</s> <s sid="33" id="emma.c3.s33">She was short, plump, and fair, with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined to continue the acquaintance.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="emma.c3.p10"><s sid="34" id="emma.c3.s34">She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing, shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.</s> <s sid="35" id="emma.c3.s35">Encouragement should be given.</s> <s sid="36" id="emma.c3.s36">Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions.</s> <s sid="37" id="emma.c3.s37">The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her.</s> <s sid="38" id="emma.c3.s38">The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort of people, must be doing her harm.</s> <s sid="39" id="emma.c3.s39">They were a family of the name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very creditably, she believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them--but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect.</s> <s sid="40" id="emma.c3.s40">_She_ would notice her; she would improve her; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her into good society; she would form her opinions and her manners.</s> <s sid="41" id="emma.c3.s41">It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="emma.c3.p11"><s sid="42" id="emma.c3.s42">She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which always closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware.</s> <s sid="43" id="emma.c3.s43">With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="emma.c3.p12"><s sid="44" id="emma.c3.s44">Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare.</s> <s sid="45" id="emma.c3.s45">He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="emma.c3.p13"><s sid="46" id="emma.c3.s46">Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to say:</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="emma.c3.p14" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="emma.c3.s47"><qs/>"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs.</s> <s sid="48" id="emma.c3.s48">An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome.</s> <s sid="49" id="emma.c3.s49">Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body.</s> <s sid="50" id="emma.c3.s50">I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see--one of our small eggs will not hurt you.</s> <s sid="51" id="emma.c3.s51">Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart--a _very_ little bit.</s> <s sid="52" id="emma.c3.s52">Ours are all apple-tarts.</s> <s sid="53" id="emma.c3.s53">You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here.</s> <s sid="54" id="emma.c3.s54">I do not advise the custard.</s> <s sid="55" id="emma.c3.s55">Mrs. Goddard, what say you to _half_ a glass of wine?</s> <s sid="56" id="emma.c3.s56">A _small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler of water?</s> <s sid="57" id="emma.c3.s57">I do not think it could disagree with you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="emma.c3.p15"><s sid="58" id="emma.c3.s58">Emma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy.</s> <s sid="59" id="emma.c3.s59">The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions.</s> <s sid="60" id="emma.c3.s60">Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken hands with her at last!</s> </p></div>

<p pid="1" id="emma.c4.p1"><s sid="1" id="emma.c4.s1">Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing.</s> <s sid="2" id="emma.c4.s2">Quick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so did their satisfaction in each other.</s> <s sid="3" id="emma.c4.s3">As a walking companion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.</s> <s sid="4" id="emma.c4.s4">In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important.</s> <s sid="5" id="emma.c4.s5">Her father never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined.</s> <s sid="6" id="emma.c4.s6">She had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges.</s> <s sid="7" id="emma.c4.s7">But in every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her kind designs.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c4.p2"><s sid="8" id="emma.c4.s8">Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to.</s> <s sid="9" id="emma.c4.s9">Her early attachment to herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.</s> <s sid="10" id="emma.c4.s10">Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the young friend she wanted--exactly the something which her home required.</s> <s sid="11" id="emma.c4.s11">Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question.</s> <s sid="12" id="emma.c4.s12">Two such could never be granted.</s> <s sid="13" id="emma.c4.s13">Two such she did not want.</s> <s sid="14" id="emma.c4.s14">It was quite a different sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent.</s> <s sid="15" id="emma.c4.s15">Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.</s> <s sid="16" id="emma.c4.s16">Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful.</s> <s sid="17" id="emma.c4.s17">For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c4.p3"><s sid="18" id="emma.c4.s18">Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents, but Harriet could not tell.</s> <s sid="19" id="emma.c4.s19">She was ready to tell every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain.</s> <s sid="20" id="emma.c4.s20">Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth.</s> <s sid="21" id="emma.c4.s21">Harriet had no penetration.</s> <s sid="22" id="emma.c4.s22">She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c4.p4" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="emma.c4.s23">Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the school in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation--and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole.</s> <s sid="24" id="emma.c4.s24">But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place.</s> <s sid="25" id="emma.c4.s25">Emma encouraged her talkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings, and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs. Martin's having <qs/>"_two_ parlours, two very good parlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's drawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it, it should be called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome summer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink tea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen people."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c4.p5"><s sid="26" id="emma.c4.s26">For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate cause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings arose.</s> <s sid="27" id="emma.c4.s27">She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs. Martin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were not taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c4.p6"><s sid="28" id="emma.c4.s28">With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin, and there was evidently no dislike to it.</s> <s sid="29" id="emma.c4.s29">Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and obliging.</s> <s sid="30" id="emma.c4.s30">He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging.</s> <s sid="31" id="emma.c4.s31">He had his shepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.</s> <s sid="32" id="emma.c4.s32">She was very fond of singing.</s> <s sid="33" id="emma.c4.s33">He could sing a little himself.</s> <s sid="34" id="emma.c4.s34">She believed he was very clever, and understood every thing.</s> <s sid="35" id="emma.c4.s35">He had a very fine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country.</s> <s sid="36" id="emma.c4.s36">She believed every body spoke well of him.</s> <s sid="37" id="emma.c4.s37">His mother and sisters were very fond of him.</s> <s sid="38" id="emma.c4.s38">Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married, he would make a good husband.</s> <s sid="39" id="emma.c4.s39">Not that she _wanted_ him to marry.</s> <s sid="40" id="emma.c4.s40">She was in no hurry at all.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="emma.c4.p7" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="emma.c4.s41"><qs/>"Well done, Mrs. Martin!"<qe/> thought Emma.</s> <s sid="42" id="emma.c4.s42"><qs/>"You know what you are about."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="emma.c4.p8" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="emma.c4.s43"><qs/>"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever seen.</s> <s sid="44" id="emma.c4.s44">Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="emma.c4.p9" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="emma.c4.s45"><qs/>"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business?</s> <s sid="46" id="emma.c4.s46">He does not read?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="emma.c4.p10" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="emma.c4.s47"><qs/>"Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has read a good deal--but not what you would think any thing of.</s> <s sid="48" id="emma.c4.s48">He reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the window seats--but he reads all _them_ to himself.</s> <s sid="49" id="emma.c4.s49">But sometimes of an evening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining.</s> <s sid="50" id="emma.c4.s50">And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield.</s> <s sid="51" id="emma.c4.s51">He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of the Abbey.</s> <s sid="52" id="emma.c4.s52">He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="emma.c4.p11"><s sid="53" id="emma.c4.s53">The next question was--</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="emma.c4.p12" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="emma.c4.s54"><qs/>"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="emma.c4.p13" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="emma.c4.s55"><qs/>"Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome.</s> <s sid="56" id="emma.c4.s56">I thought him very plain at first, but I do not think him so plain now.</s> <s sid="57" id="emma.c4.s57">One does not, you know, after a time.</s> <s sid="58" id="emma.c4.s58">But did you never see him?</s> <s sid="59" id="emma.c4.s59">He is in Highbury every now and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston.</s> <s sid="60" id="emma.c4.s60">He has passed you very often."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="emma.c4.p14" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="emma.c4.s61"><qs/>"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having any idea of his name.</s> <s sid="62" id="emma.c4.s62">A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity.</s> <s sid="63" id="emma.c4.s63">The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do.</s> <s sid="64" id="emma.c4.s64">A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other.</s> <s sid="65" id="emma.c4.s65">But a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as in every other he is below it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="emma.c4.p15" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="emma.c4.s66"><qs/>"To be sure.</s> <s sid="67" id="emma.c4.s67">Oh yes!</s> <s sid="68" id="emma.c4.s68">It is not likely you should ever have observed him; but he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="emma.c4.p16" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="emma.c4.s69"><qs/>"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man.</s> <s sid="70" id="emma.c4.s70">I know, indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well.</s> <s sid="71" id="emma.c4.s71">What do you imagine his age to be?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="emma.c4.p17" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="emma.c4.s72"><qs/>"He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very odd."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="emma.c4.p18" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="emma.c4.s73"><qs/>"Only four-and-twenty.</s> <s sid="74" id="emma.c4.s74">That is too young to settle.</s> <s sid="75" id="emma.c4.s75">His mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry.</s> <s sid="76" id="emma.c4.s76">They seem very comfortable as they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would probably repent it.</s> <s sid="77" id="emma.c4.s77">Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it might be very desirable."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="emma.c4.p19" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="emma.c4.s78"><qs/>"Six years hence!</s> <s sid="79" id="emma.c4.s79">Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="emma.c4.p20" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="emma.c4.s80"><qs/>"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not born to an independence.</s> <s sid="81" id="emma.c4.s81">Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune entirely to make--cannot be at all beforehand with the world.</s> <s sid="82" id="emma.c4.s82">Whatever money he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="emma.c4.p21" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="emma.c4.s83"><qs/>"To be sure, so it is.</s> <s sid="84" id="emma.c4.s84">But they live very comfortably.</s> <s sid="85" id="emma.c4.s85">They have no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="emma.c4.p22" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="emma.c4.s86"><qs/>"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does marry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though his sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice.</s> <s sid="87" id="emma.c4.s87">The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates.</s> <s sid="88" id="emma.c4.s88">There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman's daughter, and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="emma.c4.p23" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="emma.c4.s89"><qs/>"Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are.</s> <s sid="90" id="emma.c4.s90">But while I visit at Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any body can do."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="emma.c4.p24" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="emma.c4.s91"><qs/>"You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse.</s> <s sid="92" id="emma.c4.s92">I want to see you permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer's daughter, without education."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="emma.c4.p25" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="emma.c4.s93"><qs/>"To be sure.</s> <s sid="94" id="emma.c4.s94">Yes.</s> <s sid="95" id="emma.c4.s95">Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education--and been very well brought up.</s> <s sid="96" id="emma.c4.s96">However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against your's--and I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife.</s> <s sid="97" id="emma.c4.s97">I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me.</s> <s sid="98" id="emma.c4.s98">But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="emma.c4.p26"><s sid="99" id="emma.c4.s99">Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no alarming symptoms of love.</s> <s sid="100" id="emma.c4.s100">The young man had been the first admirer, but she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no serious difficulty, on Harriet's side, to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="emma.c4.p27"><s sid="101" id="emma.c4.s101">They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the Donwell road.</s> <s sid="102" id="emma.c4.s102">He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion.</s> <s sid="103" id="emma.c4.s103">Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few yards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin.</s> <s sid="104" id="emma.c4.s104">His appearance was very neat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no other advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet's inclination.</s> <s sid="105" id="emma.c4.s105">Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily noticed her father's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder.</s> <s sid="106" id="emma.c4.s106">Mr. Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="emma.c4.p28"><s sid="107" id="emma.c4.s107">They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="emma.c4.p29" type="speech"><s sid="108" id="emma.c4.s108"><qs/>"Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd!</s> <s sid="109" id="emma.c4.s109">It was quite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls.</s> <s sid="110" id="emma.c4.s110">He did not think we ever walked this road.</s> <s sid="111" id="emma.c4.s111">He thought we walked towards Randalls most days.</s> <s sid="112" id="emma.c4.s112">He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.</s> <s sid="113" id="emma.c4.s113">He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow.</s> <s sid="114" id="emma.c4.s114">So very odd we should happen to meet!</s> <s sid="115" id="emma.c4.s115">Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected?</s> <s sid="116" id="emma.c4.s116">What do you think of him?</s> <s sid="117" id="emma.c4.s117">Do you think him so very plain?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="emma.c4.p30" type="speech"><s sid="118" id="emma.c4.s118"><qs/>"He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility.</s> <s sid="119" id="emma.c4.s119">I had no right to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish, so totally without air.</s> <s sid="120" id="emma.c4.s120">I had imagined him, I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="emma.c4.p31" type="speech"><s sid="121" id="emma.c4.s121"><qs/>"To be sure,"<qe/><sls/> said Harriet, in a mortified voice, <sle/><qs/>"he is not so genteel as real gentlemen."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="emma.c11.p1"><s sid="1" id="emma.c11.s1">Mr. Elton must now be left to himself.</s> <s sid="2" id="emma.c11.s2">It was no longer in Emma's power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures.</s> <s sid="3" id="emma.c11.s3">The coming of her sister's family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected--she did not herself expect-- that any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers.</s> <s sid="4" id="emma.c11.s4">They might advance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no.</s> <s sid="5" id="emma.c11.s5">She hardly wished to have more leisure for them.</s> <s sid="6" id="emma.c11.s6">There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will do for themselves.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c11.p2"><s sid="7" id="emma.c11.s7">Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest.</s> <s sid="8" id="emma.c11.s8">Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c11.p3"><s sid="9" id="emma.c11.s9">He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety.</s> <s sid="10" id="emma.c11.s10">The bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones, and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing, which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him, either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c11.p4"><s sid="11" id="emma.c11.s11">Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible.</s> <s sid="12" id="emma.c11.s12">She could never see a fault in any of them.</s> <s sid="13" id="emma.c11.s13">She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited also much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health, over-careful of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.</s> <s sid="14" id="emma.c11.s14">They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c11.p5"><s sid="15" id="emma.c11.s15">Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man; rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour.</s> <s sid="16" id="emma.c11.s16">He was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased.</s> <s sid="17" id="emma.c11.s17">The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his.</s> <s sid="18" id="emma.c11.s18">He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted, and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c11.p6"><s sid="19" id="emma.c11.s19">He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law.</s> <s sid="20" id="emma.c11.s20">Nothing wrong in him escaped her.</s> <s sid="21" id="emma.c11.s21">She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself.</s> <s sid="22" id="emma.c11.s22">Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her father.</s> <s sid="23" id="emma.c11.s23">There he had not always the patience that could have been wished.</s> <s sid="24" id="emma.c11.s24">Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed.</s> <s sid="25" id="emma.c11.s25">It did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often for Emma's charity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not.</s> <s sid="26" id="emma.c11.s26">The beginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.</s> <s sid="27" id="emma.c11.s27">They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter's attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="emma.c11.p7" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="emma.c11.s28"><qs/>"Ah, my dear,"<qe/><sss/> said he, <sse/><qs/>"poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="emma.c11.p8" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="emma.c11.s29"><qs/>"Oh yes, sir,"<qe/><sls/> cried she with ready sympathy, <sle/><qs/>"how you must miss her!</s> <s sid="30" id="emma.c11.s30">And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!-- I have been so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly do without her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope she is pretty well, sir."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="emma.c11.p9" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="emma.c11.s31"><qs/>"Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="emma.c11.p10"><s sid="32" id="emma.c11.s32">Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="emma.c11.p11" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="emma.c11.s33"><qs/>"Oh! no--none in the least.</s> <s sid="34" id="emma.c11.s34">I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my life-- never looking so well.</s> <s sid="35" id="emma.c11.s35">Papa is only speaking his own regret."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="emma.c11.p12" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="emma.c11.s36"><qs/>"Very much to the honour of both,"<qe/> was the handsome reply.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="emma.c11.p13" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="emma.c11.s37"><qs/>"And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?"<qe/> asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="emma.c11.p14" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="emma.c11.s38">Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--<qs/>"Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="emma.c11.p15" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="emma.c11.s39"><qs/>"Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married.</s> <s sid="40" id="emma.c11.s40">Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both, either at Randalls or here--and as you may suppose, Isabella, most frequently here.</s> <s sid="41" id="emma.c11.s41">They are very, very kind in their visits.</s> <s sid="42" id="emma.c11.s42">Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself.</s> <s sid="43" id="emma.c11.s43">Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all.</s> <s sid="44" id="emma.c11.s44">Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact truth."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="emma.c11.p16" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="emma.c11.s45"><qs/>"Just as it should be,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. John Knightley, <sse/><qs/>"and just as I hoped it was from your letters.</s> <s sid="46" id="emma.c11.s46">Her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy.</s> <s sid="47" id="emma.c11.s47">I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="emma.c11.p17" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="emma.c11.s48"><qs/>"Why, to be sure,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Woodhouse--<sse/><qs/>"yes, certainly--I cannot deny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty often-- but then--she is always obliged to go away again."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="emma.c11.p18" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="emma.c11.s49"><qs/>"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.-- You quite forget poor Mr. Weston."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="emma.c11.p19" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="emma.c11.s50"><qs/>"I think, indeed,"<qe/><sss/> said John Knightley pleasantly, <sse/><qs/>"that Mr. Weston has some little claim.</s> <s sid="51" id="emma.c11.s51">You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of the poor husband.</s> <s sid="52" id="emma.c11.s52">I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force.</s> <s sid="53" id="emma.c11.s53">As for Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="emma.c11.p20" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="emma.c11.s54"><qs/>"Me, my love,"<qe/><sls/> cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.-- <sle/><qs/>"Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he does not deserve.</s> <s sid="55" id="emma.c11.s55">I believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever existed.</s> <s sid="56" id="emma.c11.s56">Excepting yourself and your brother, I do not know his equal for temper.</s> <s sid="57" id="emma.c11.s57">I shall never forget his flying Henry's kite for him that very windy day last Easter--and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night, on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="emma.c11.p21" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="emma.c11.s58"><qs/>"Where is the young man?"<qe/> said John Knightley.</s> <s sid="59" id="emma.c11.s59"><qs/>"Has he been here on this occasion--or has he not?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="emma.c11.p22" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="emma.c11.s60"><qs/>"He has not been here yet,"<qe/> replied Emma.</s> <s sid="61" id="emma.c11.s61"><qs/>"There was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="emma.c11.p23" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="emma.c11.s62"><qs/>"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,"<qe/> said her father.</s> <s sid="63" id="emma.c11.s63"><qs/>"He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very proper, handsome letter it was.</s> <s sid="64" id="emma.c11.s64">She shewed it to me.</s> <s sid="65" id="emma.c11.s65">I thought it very well done of him indeed.</s> <s sid="66" id="emma.c11.s66">Whether it was his own idea you know, one cannot tell.</s> <s sid="67" id="emma.c11.s67">He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="emma.c11.p25" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="emma.c11.s70"><qs/>"Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thought it-- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother!</s> <s sid="71" id="emma.c11.s71">Well, time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad.</s> <s sid="72" id="emma.c11.s72">However, it was an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of pleasure.</s> <s sid="73" id="emma.c11.s73">I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.</s> <s sid="74" id="emma.c11.s74">28th--and began, `My dear Madam,<alt-qs/>' but I forget how it went on; and it was signed `F.</s> <s sid="75" id="emma.c11.s75">C.

<p pid="26" id="emma.c11.p26" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="emma.c11.s76"><qs/>"How very pleasing and proper of him!"<qe/> cried the good-hearted Mrs. John Knightley.</s> <s sid="77" id="emma.c11.s77"><qs/>"I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man.</s> <s sid="78" id="emma.c11.s78">But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father!</s> <s sid="79" id="emma.c11.s79">There is something so shocking in a child's being taken away from his parents and natural home!</s> <s sid="80" id="emma.c11.s80">I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with him.</s> <s sid="81" id="emma.c11.s81">To give up one's child!</s> <s sid="82" id="emma.c11.s82">I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="emma.c11.p28"><s sid="86" id="emma.c11.s86">Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass.</s> <s sid="87" id="emma.c11.s87">She would keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted her brother's disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was important.--It had a high claim to forbearance.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c14.p2"><s sid="6" id="emma.c14.s6">This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was grateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr. Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c14.p3"><s sid="7" id="emma.c14.s7">The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival.</s> <s sid="8" id="emma.c14.s8">Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c14.p4" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="emma.c14.s9">Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close to her.</s> <s sid="10" id="emma.c14.s10">The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion.</s> <s sid="11" id="emma.c14.s11">Instead of forgetting him, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of <qs/>"Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!"<qe/>-- Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father, and so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners.</s> <s sid="12" id="emma.c14.s12">For her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet's, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to.</s> <s sid="13" id="emma.c14.s13">She heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son; she heard the words <qs/>"my son,"<qe/><sss/> and <sse/><qs/>"Frank,"<qe/><sss/> and <sse/><qs/>"my son,"<qe/> repeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c14.p5"><s sid="14" id="emma.c14.s14">Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill, which always interested her.</s> <s sid="15" id="emma.c14.s15">She had frequently thought--especially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor--that if she _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition.</s> <s sid="16" id="emma.c14.s16">He seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to her.</s> <s sid="17" id="emma.c14.s17">She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of.</s> <s sid="18" id="emma.c14.s18">That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided intention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends' imaginations.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c14.p6"><s sid="19" id="emma.c14.s19">With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;-- for when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say to her,</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c17.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="emma.c17.s3">The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with Mr. Elton's best compliments, <qs/>"that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath; where, in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend a few weeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, from various circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense-- and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be happy to attend to them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c17.p3"><s sid="4" id="emma.c17.s4">Emma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. Elton's absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired.</s> <s sid="5" id="emma.c17.s5">She admired him for contriving it, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced.</s> <s sid="6" id="emma.c17.s6">Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded.</s> <s sid="7" id="emma.c17.s7">She had not even a share in his opening compliments.--Her name was not mentioned;-- and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments, as she thought, at first, could not escape her father's suspicion.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c17.p4"><s sid="8" id="emma.c17.s8">It did, however.--Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language.</s> <s sid="9" id="emma.c17.s9">It was a very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening.</s> <s sid="10" id="emma.c17.s10">Mr. Woodhouse talked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c17.p5"><s sid="11" id="emma.c17.s11">She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark.</s> <s sid="12" id="emma.c17.s12">She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman's return.</s> <s sid="13" id="emma.c17.s13">She went to Mrs. Goddard's accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary penance of communication; and a severe one it was.-- She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding--to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred-- and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject, all her observations, all her convictions, all her prophecies for the last six weeks.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c17.p6"><s sid="14" id="emma.c17.s14">The confession completely renewed her first shame--and the sight of Harriet's tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="emma.c17.p7"><s sid="15" id="emma.c17.s15">Harriet bore the intelligence very well--blaming nobody-- and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="emma.c17.p8"><s sid="16" id="emma.c17.s16">Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost; and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on Harriet's side, not her own.</s> <s sid="17" id="emma.c17.s17">Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of.</s> <s sid="18" id="emma.c17.s18">The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.-- She never could have deserved him--and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="emma.c17.p9"><s sid="19" id="emma.c17.s19">Her tears fell abundantly--but her grief was so truly artless, that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes-- and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding--really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two--and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="emma.c17.p10"><s sid="20" id="emma.c17.s20">It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of her life.</s> <s sid="21" id="emma.c17.s21">Her second duty now, inferior only to her father's claims, was to promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match-making.</s> <s sid="22" id="emma.c17.s22">She got her to Hartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying kindness, striving to occupy and amuse her, and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="emma.c17.p11"><s sid="23" id="emma.c17.s23">Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet's age, and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return, as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance, without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="emma.c17.p12"><s sid="24" id="emma.c17.s24">Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness--and did, in truth, prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet it appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="emma.c17.p13"><s sid="25" id="emma.c17.s25">If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could not imagine Harriet's persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="emma.c17.p14"><s sid="26" id="emma.c17.s26">Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for each, for all three.</s> <s sid="27" id="emma.c17.s27">Not one of them had the power of removal, or of effecting any material change of society.</s> <s sid="28" id="emma.c17.s28">They must encounter each other, and make the best of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="emma.c17.p15"><s sid="29" id="emma.c17.s29">Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs. Goddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth.</s> <s sid="30" id="emma.c17.s30">Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be found if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true peace for herself.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="1" id="emma.c18.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="emma.c18.s1">Mr. Frank Churchill did not come.</s> <s sid="2" id="emma.c18.s2">When the time proposed drew near, Mrs. Weston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse.</s> <s sid="3" id="emma.c18.s3">For the present, he could not be spared, to his <qs/>"very great mortification and regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c18.p2"><s sid="4" id="emma.c18.s4">Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed--much more disappointed, in fact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober:  but a sanguine temper, though for ever expecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression.</s> <s sid="5" id="emma.c18.s5">It soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again.</s> <s sid="6" id="emma.c18.s6">For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank's coming two or three months later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c18.p3"><s sid="7" id="emma.c18.s7">These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c18.p4"><s sid="8" id="emma.c18.s8">Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr. Frank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment at Randalls.</s> <s sid="9" id="emma.c18.s9">The acquaintance at present had no charm for her.</s> <s sid="10" id="emma.c18.s10">She wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self, she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as might naturally belong to their friendship.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c18.p5"><s sid="11" id="emma.c18.s11">She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away.</s> <s sid="12" id="emma.c18.s12">She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c18.p6" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="emma.c18.s13"><qs/>"The Churchills are very likely in fault,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Knightley, coolly; <sse/><qs/>"but I dare say he might come if he would."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="emma.c18.p10" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="emma.c18.s20"><qs/>"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who have always set him the example of it.</s> <s sid="21" id="emma.c18.s21">It is a great deal more natural than one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish too.</s> <s sid="22" id="emma.c18.s22">If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have contrived it between September and January.</s> <s sid="23" id="emma.c18.s23">A man at his age--what is he?--three or four-and-twenty--cannot be without the means of doing as much as that.</s> <s sid="24" id="emma.c18.s24">It is impossible."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="emma.c18.p11" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="emma.c18.s25"><qs/>"That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your own master.</s> <s sid="26" id="emma.c18.s26">You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence.</s> <s sid="27" id="emma.c18.s27">You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="emma.c18.p12" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="emma.c18.s28"><qs/>"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount.</s> <s sid="29" id="emma.c18.s29">He cannot want money--he cannot want leisure.</s> <s sid="30" id="emma.c18.s30">We know, on the contrary, that he has so much of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom.</s> <s sid="31" id="emma.c18.s31">We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or other.</s> <s sid="32" id="emma.c18.s32">A little while ago, he was at Weymouth.</s> <s sid="33" id="emma.c18.s33">This proves that he can leave the Churchills."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c19.p2"><s sid="3" id="emma.c19.s3">They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.</s> <s sid="4" id="emma.c19.s4">She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers.</s> <s sid="5" id="emma.c19.s5">There was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c19.p3"><s sid="6" id="emma.c19.s6">She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart, as to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome women-- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and therefore she seldom went near them.</s> <s sid="7" id="emma.c19.s7">But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in--observing, as she proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate, they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c19.p6"><s sid="13" id="emma.c19.s13">This she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant, having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties.</s> <s sid="14" id="emma.c19.s14">She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="emma.c19.p11"><s sid="34" id="emma.c19.s34">All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax's handwriting.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="emma.c20.p1"><s sid="1" id="emma.c20.s1">Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's youngest daughter.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c20.p2"><s sid="2" id="emma.c20.s2">The marriage of Lieut.</s> <s sid="3" id="emma.c20.s3">Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry, and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad--of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c20.p3"><s sid="4" id="emma.c20.s4">By birth she belonged to Highbury:  and when at three years old, on losing her mother, she became the property, the charge, the consolation, the fondling of her grandmother and aunt, there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there; of her being taught only what very limited means could command, and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c20.p4"><s sid="5" id="emma.c20.s5">But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny.</s> <s sid="6" id="emma.c20.s6">This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved his life.</s> <s sid="7" id="emma.c20.s7">These were claims which he did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put any thing in his power.</s> <s sid="8" id="emma.c20.s8">When he did return, he sought out the child and took notice of her.</s> <s sid="9" id="emma.c20.s9">He was a married man, with only one living child, a girl, about Jane's age:  and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old, his daughter's great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a real friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education.</s> <s sid="10" id="emma.c20.s10">It was accepted; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family, and had lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother from time to time.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c20.p5"><s sid="11" id="emma.c20.s11">The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible.</s> <s sid="12" id="emma.c20.s12">To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell's power; for though his income, by pay and appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter's; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c20.p6"><s sid="13" id="emma.c20.s13">Such was Jane Fairfax's history.</s> <s sid="14" id="emma.c20.s14">She had fallen into good hands, known nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent education.</s> <s sid="15" id="emma.c20.s15">Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people, her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's residence being in London, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters.</s> <s sid="16" id="emma.c20.s16">Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she was too much beloved to be parted with.</s> <s sid="17" id="emma.c20.s17">Neither father nor mother could promote, and the daughter could not endure it.</s> <s sid="18" id="emma.c20.s18">The evil day was put off.</s> <s sid="19" id="emma.c20.s19">It was easy to decide that she was still too young; and Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="emma.c20.p7"><s sid="20" id="emma.c20.s20">The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements.</s> <s sid="21" id="emma.c20.s21">That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents.</s> <s sid="22" id="emma.c20.s22">They continued together with unabated regard however, till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="emma.c20.p8"><s sid="23" id="emma.c20.s23">This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning.</s> <s sid="24" id="emma.c20.s24">She had long resolved that one-and-twenty should be the period.</s> <s sid="25" id="emma.c20.s25">With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="emma.c20.p9"><s sid="26" id="emma.c20.s26">The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a resolution, though their feelings did.</s> <s sid="27" id="emma.c20.s27">As long as they lived, no exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this would be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better be soon.</s> <s sid="28" id="emma.c20.s28">Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished.</s> <s sid="29" id="emma.c20.s29">Still, however, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment.</s> <s sid="30" id="emma.c20.s30">She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter's marriage; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="emma.c20.p10"><s sid="31" id="emma.c20.s31">With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths not told.</s> <s sid="32" id="emma.c20.s32">It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the recovery of her health, than on any thing else.</s> <s sid="33" id="emma.c20.s33">Certain it was that she was to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of a two years' absence.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="emma.c20.p11" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="emma.c20.s34">Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished, and less than she ought!</s> <s sid="35" id="emma.c20.s35">Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her.</s> <s sid="36" id="emma.c20.s36">But <qs/>"she could never get acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve-- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not--and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other."<qe/></s> <s sid="37" id="emma.c20.s37">These were her reasons-- she had no better.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="emma.c20.p12"><s sid="38" id="emma.c20.s38">It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years' interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.</s> <s sid="39" id="emma.c20.s39">Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself the highest value for elegance.</s> <s sid="40" id="emma.c20.s40">Her height was pretty, just such as almost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; her figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two.</s> <s sid="41" id="emma.c20.s41">Emma could not but feel all this; and then, her face--her features-- there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing beauty.</s> <s sid="42" id="emma.c20.s42">Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom.</s> <s sid="43" id="emma.c20.s43">It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour, by all her principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury.</s> <s sid="44" id="emma.c20.s44">There, not to be vulgar, was distinction, and merit.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="emma.c20.p13"><s sid="45" id="emma.c20.s45">In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer.</s> <s sid="46" id="emma.c20.s46">When she took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she was going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every well-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so naturally started to herself.</s> <s sid="47" id="emma.c20.s47">In that case, nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.</s> <s sid="48" id="emma.c20.s48">Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon's actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first.</s> <s sid="49" id="emma.c20.s49">If it were love, it might be simple, single, successless love on her side alone.</s> <s sid="50" id="emma.c20.s50">She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his conversation with her friend; and from the best, the purest of motives, might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="emma.c20.p14"><s sid="51" id="emma.c20.s51">Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings, as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="emma.c20.p15" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="emma.c20.s52">These were charming feelings--but not lasting.</s> <s sid="53" id="emma.c20.s53">Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, <qs/>"She certainly is handsome; she is better than handsome!"<qe/></s> <s sid="54" id="emma.c20.s54">Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state.</s> <s sid="55" id="emma.c20.s55">Former provocations reappeared.</s> <s sid="56" id="emma.c20.s56">The aunt was as tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how small a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.</s> <s sid="57" id="emma.c20.s57">They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance.</s> <s sid="58" id="emma.c20.s58">She was, besides, which was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious!</s> <s sid="59" id="emma.c20.s59">There was no getting at her real opinion.</s> <s sid="60" id="emma.c20.s60">Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed determined to hazard nothing.</s> <s sid="61" id="emma.c20.s61">She was disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="emma.c20.p16"><s sid="62" id="emma.c20.s62">If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing.</s> <s sid="63" id="emma.c20.s63">She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or her own value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match.</s> <s sid="64" id="emma.c20.s64">It was all general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished.</s> <s sid="65" id="emma.c20.s65">It did her no service however.</s> <s sid="66" id="emma.c20.s66">Her caution was thrown away.</s> <s sid="67" id="emma.c20.s67">Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her first surmises.</s> <s sid="68" id="emma.c20.s68">There probably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="emma.c20.p17" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="emma.c20.s69">The like reserve prevailed on other topics.</s> <s sid="70" id="emma.c20.s70">She and Mr. Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time.</s> <s sid="71" id="emma.c20.s71">It was known that they were a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what he truly was.</s> <s sid="72" id="emma.c20.s72"><qs/>"Was he handsome?"<qe/>--"She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man."</s> <s sid="73" id="emma.c20.s73"><qs/>"Was he agreeable?"<qe/>-- <qs/>"He was generally thought so."<qe/></s> <s sid="74" id="emma.c20.s74"><qs/>"Did he appear a sensible young man; a young man of information?"<qe/>--"At a watering-place, or in a common London acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points.</s> <s sid="75" id="emma.c20.s75">Manners were all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill.</s> <s sid="76" id="emma.c20.s76">She believed every body found his manners pleasing."</s> <s sid="77" id="emma.c20.s77">Emma could not forgive her.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="1" id="emma.c21.p1"><s sid="1" id="emma.c21.s1">Emma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma.</s> <s sid="2" id="emma.c21.s2">He had been used to think her unjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c24.p2"><s sid="6" id="emma.c24.s6">Emma had hardly expected them:  for Mr. Weston, who had called in for half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her, therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in arm.</s> <s sid="7" id="emma.c24.s7">She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend.</s> <s sid="8" id="emma.c24.s8">If he were deficient there, nothing should make amends for it.</s> <s sid="9" id="emma.c24.s9">But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied.</s> <s sid="10" id="emma.c24.s10">It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her--nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection.</s> <s sid="11" id="emma.c24.s11">And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning.</s> <s sid="12" id="emma.c24.s12">They were all three walking about together for an hour or two-- first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury.</s> <s sid="13" id="emma.c24.s13">He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was resolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village, and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c24.p3"><s sid="14" id="emma.c24.s14">Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings.</s> <s sid="15" id="emma.c24.s15">He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and which had been the home of his father's father; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must be very like a merit to those he was with.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c24.p4"><s sid="16" id="emma.c24.s16">Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him justice.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c24.p5"><s sid="17" id="emma.c24.s17">Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;--but such brilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place.</s> <s sid="18" id="emma.c24.s18">He was immediately interested.</s> <s sid="19" id="emma.c24.s19">Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities, and lament that its original purpose should have ceased.</s> <s sid="20" id="emma.c24.s20">He saw no fault in the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested.</s> <s sid="21" id="emma.c24.s21">No, it was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough.</s> <s sid="22" id="emma.c24.s22">It would hold the very number for comfort.</s> <s sid="23" id="emma.c24.s23">They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter.</s> <s sid="24" id="emma.c24.s24">Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in Highbury!</s> <s sid="25" id="emma.c24.s25">The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied.</s> <s sid="26" id="emma.c24.s26">He could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars were given and families described, he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into their proper place the next morning.</s> <s sid="27" id="emma.c24.s27">He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.</s> <s sid="28" id="emma.c24.s28">He seemed to have all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe.</s> <s sid="29" id="emma.c24.s29">Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind.</s> <s sid="30" id="emma.c24.s30">He could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap.</s> <s sid="31" id="emma.c24.s31">It was but an effusion of lively spirits.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c25.p2"><s sid="7" id="emma.c25.s7">With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him.</s> <s sid="8" id="emma.c25.s8">Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether.</s> <s sid="9" id="emma.c25.s9">He appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful and lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great deal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond of talking of him--said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect.</s> <s sid="10" id="emma.c25.s10">This was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of being at least very near it, and saved only by her own indifference-- (for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the honour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c38.p3" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="emma.c38.s7">Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.</s> <s sid="8" id="emma.c38.s8">They all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first, without great surprize.</s> <s sid="9" id="emma.c38.s9"><qs/>"So unreasonably early!"<qe/> she was going to exclaim; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins, who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c38.p4"><s sid="10" id="emma.c38.s10">Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity.</s> <s sid="11" id="emma.c38.s11">She liked his open manners, but a little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher character.--General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a man what he ought to be.-- She could fancy such a man.</s> <s sid="12" id="emma.c38.s12">The whole party walked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though _May_, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="emma.c39.p1"><s sid="1" id="emma.c39.s1">This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure.</s> <s sid="2" id="emma.c39.s2">It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was peculiarly gratifying.</s> <s sid="3" id="emma.c39.s3">The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward to another happy result--the cure of Harriet's infatuation.-- From Harriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom, she had strong hopes.</s> <s sid="4" id="emma.c39.s4">It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him.</s> <s sid="5" id="emma.c39.s5">The fever was over, and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy.</s> <s sid="6" id="emma.c39.s6">She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite.--Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before her!</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c39.p2"><s sid="7" id="emma.c39.s7">She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning.</s> <s sid="8" id="emma.c39.s8">He had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he was to be at home by the middle of the day.</s> <s sid="9" id="emma.c39.s9">She did not regret it.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c39.p3"><s sid="10" id="emma.c39.s10">Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa, when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill, with Harriet leaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened.</s> <s sid="11" id="emma.c39.s11">Harriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.-- The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder;-- they were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c39.p4"><s sid="12" id="emma.c39.s12">A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered, and surprizes be explained.</s> <s sid="13" id="emma.c39.s13">Such events are very interesting, but the suspense of them cannot last long.</s> <s sid="14" id="emma.c39.s14">A few minutes made Emma acquainted with the whole.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c39.p5"><s sid="15" id="emma.c39.s15">Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs. Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough for safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile beyond Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became for a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies.</s> <s sid="16" id="emma.c39.s16">A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling on Harriet to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at the top, and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury.</s> <s sid="17" id="emma.c39.s17">But poor Harriet could not follow.</s> <s sid="18" id="emma.c39.s18">She had suffered very much from cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless-- and in this state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged to remain.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c39.p6"><s sid="19" id="emma.c39.s19">How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and impertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened, she immediately promised them money, and taking out her purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more, or to use her ill.--She was then able to walk, though but slowly, and was moving away--but her terror and her purse were too tempting, and she was followed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="emma.c41.p19"><s sid="61" id="emma.c41.s61">They were entering the hall.</s> <s sid="62" id="emma.c41.s62">Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded Miss Bates's in a glance at Jane.</s> <s sid="63" id="emma.c41.s63">From Frank Churchill's face, where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy with her shawl.</s> <s sid="64" id="emma.c41.s64">Mr. Weston had walked in.</s> <s sid="65" id="emma.c41.s65">The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass.</s> <s sid="66" id="emma.c41.s66">Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye-- he seemed watching her intently--in vain, however, if it were so-- Jane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="emma.c41.p20"><s sid="67" id="emma.c41.s67">There was no time for farther remark or explanation.</s> <s sid="68" id="emma.c41.s68">The dream must be borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield, and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on which two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded.</s> <s sid="69" id="emma.c41.s69">Tea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="emma.c41.p22" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="emma.c41.s76">Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves.</s> <s sid="77" id="emma.c41.s77">They were rapidly forming words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled.</s> <s sid="78" id="emma.c41.s78">The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the <qs/>"poor little boys,"<qe/> or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter near him, how beautifully Emma had written it.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="emma.c41.p23"><s sid="79" id="emma.c41.s79">Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax.</s> <s sid="80" id="emma.c41.s80">She gave a slight glance round the table, and applied herself to it.</s> <s sid="81" id="emma.c41.s81">Frank was next to Emma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them all; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little apparent observation.</s> <s sid="82" id="emma.c41.s82">The word was discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away.</s> <s sid="83" id="emma.c41.s83">If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work.</s> <s sid="84" id="emma.c41.s84">She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help.</s> <s sid="85" id="emma.c41.s85">The word was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there was a blush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible.</s> <s sid="86" id="emma.c41.s86">Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could all be, was beyond his comprehension.</s> <s sid="87" id="emma.c41.s87">How the delicacy, the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep!</s> <s sid="88" id="emma.c41.s88">He feared there must be some decided involvement.</s> <s sid="89" id="emma.c41.s89">Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn.</s> <s sid="90" id="emma.c41.s90">These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick.</s> <s sid="91" id="emma.c41.s91">It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill's part.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="emma.c41.p26" type="speech"><s sid="103" id="emma.c41.s103"><qs/>"Aye, very true, my dear,"<qe/><sls/> cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken a word--<sle/><qs/>"I was just going to say the same thing.</s> <s sid="104" id="emma.c41.s104">It is time for us to be going indeed.</s> <s sid="105" id="emma.c41.s105">The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking for us.</s> <s sid="106" id="emma.c41.s106">My dear sir, you are too obliging.</s> <s sid="107" id="emma.c41.s107">We really must wish you good night."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="emma.c41.p27"><s sid="108" id="emma.c41.s108">Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived.</s> <s sid="109" id="emma.c41.s109">She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined.</s> <s sid="110" id="emma.c41.s110">She was afterwards looking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was looking also--it was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted, Mr. Knightley could not tell.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c42.p2"><s sid="4" id="emma.c42.s4">Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed.</s> <s sid="5" id="emma.c42.s5">It was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade.</s> <s sid="6" id="emma.c42.s6">Her introductions and recommendations must all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of.</s> <s sid="7" id="emma.c42.s7">So she thought at first;--but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off.</s> <s sid="8" id="emma.c42.s8">Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come?</s> <s sid="9" id="emma.c42.s9">They could go there again with them in the autumn.</s> <s sid="10" id="emma.c42.s10">It was settled that they should go to Box Hill.</s> <s sid="11" id="emma.c42.s11">That there was to be such a party had been long generally known:  it had even given the idea of another.</s> <s sid="12" id="emma.c42.s12">Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither.</s> <s sid="13" id="emma.c42.s13">Two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c42.p3"><s sid="14" id="emma.c42.s14">This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr. Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother and sister had failed her, that the two parties should unite, and go together; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it was to be, if she had no objection.</s> <s sid="15" id="emma.c42.s15">Now, as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware, it was not worth bringing forward again:--it could not be done without a reproof to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs. Elton's party!</s> <s sid="16" id="emma.c42.s16">Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c42.p4" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="emma.c42.s17"><qs/>"I am glad you approve of what I have done,"<qe/> said he very comfortably.</s> <s sid="18" id="emma.c42.s18"><qs/>"But I thought you would.</s> <s sid="19" id="emma.c42.s19">Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers.</s> <s sid="20" id="emma.c42.s20">One cannot have too large a party.</s> <s sid="21" id="emma.c42.s21">A large party secures its own amusement.</s> <s sid="22" id="emma.c42.s22">And she is a good-natured woman after all.</s> <s sid="23" id="emma.c42.s23">One could not leave her out."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c42.p5"><s sid="24" id="emma.c42.s24">Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c42.p6"><s sid="25" id="emma.c42.s25">It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty.</s> <s sid="26" id="emma.c42.s26">It might be weeks, it might be only a few days, before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured on, and it was all melancholy stagnation.</s> <s sid="27" id="emma.c42.s27">Mrs. Elton's resources were inadequate to such an attack.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="emma.c42.p7" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="emma.c42.s28"><qs/>"Is not this most vexations, Knightley?"<qe/><sss/> she cried.--<sse/><qs/>"And such weather for exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious.</s> <s sid="29" id="emma.c42.s29">What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing done.</s> <s sid="30" id="emma.c42.s30">Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="emma.c42.p9" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="emma.c42.s35">If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so, for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the <qs/>"Oh!</s> <s sid="36" id="emma.c42.s36">I should like it of all things,"<qe/> was not plainer in words than manner.</s> <s sid="37" id="emma.c42.s37">Donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation:  but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere.</s> <s sid="38" id="emma.c42.s38">She promised him again and again to come--much oftener than he doubted--and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="emma.c42.p10" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="emma.c42.s39"><qs/>"You may depend upon me,"<qe/> said she.</s> <s sid="40" id="emma.c42.s40"><qs/>"I certainly will come.</s> <s sid="41" id="emma.c42.s41">Name your day, and I will come.</s> <s sid="42" id="emma.c42.s42">You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="emma.c42.p29"><s sid="101" id="emma.c42.s101">Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade.</s> <s sid="102" id="emma.c42.s102">He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill.  Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at Donwell, be tempted away to his misery.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="emma.c42.p30" type="speech"><s sid="103" id="emma.c42.s103">He was invited on good faith.</s> <s sid="104" id="emma.c42.s104">No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity.</s> <s sid="105" id="emma.c42.s105">He did consent.</s> <s sid="106" id="emma.c42.s106">He had not been at Donwell for two years.</s> <s sid="107" id="emma.c42.s107"><qs/>"Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could go very well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls walked about the gardens.</s> <s sid="108" id="emma.c42.s108">He did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of the day.</s> <s sid="109" id="emma.c42.s109">He should like to see the old house again exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his, and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning.</s> <s sid="110" id="emma.c42.s110">He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them-- very kind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of dining out."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="emma.c42.p31"><s sid="111" id="emma.c42.s111">Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence.</s> <s sid="112" id="emma.c42.s112">The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.-- Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing, and spare no arguments to induce him to come.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="emma.c42.p32"><s sid="113" id="emma.c42.s113">In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather appearing exactly right.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="emma.c42.p33"><s sid="114" id="emma.c42.s114">Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of this al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was happily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not to heat themselves.-- Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when all the others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and sympathiser.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="emma.c42.p34"><s sid="115" id="emma.c42.s115">It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she was satisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave him, and look around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="emma.c42.p35" type="speech"><s sid="116" id="emma.c42.s116">She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming, characteristic situation, low and sheltered-- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with all the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight--and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.--The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike it, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many comfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought to be, and it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect for it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John Knightley had; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably.</s> <s sid="117" id="emma.c42.s117">She had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush.</s> <s sid="118" id="emma.c42.s118">These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the strawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or talking--strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or spoken of.--<qs/>"The best fruit in England-- every body's favourite--always wholesome.--These the finest beds and finest sorts.--Delightful to gather for one's self--the only way of really enjoying them.--Morning decidedly the best time--never tired-- every sort good--hautboy infinitely superior--no comparison-- the others hardly eatable--hautboys very scarce--Chili preferred-- white wood finest flavour of all--price of strawberries in London-- abundance about Bristol--Maple Grove--cultivation--beds when to be renewed--gardeners thinking exactly different--no general rule-- gardeners never to be put out of their way--delicious fruit-- only too rich to be eaten much of--inferior to cherries-- currants more refreshing--only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--could bear it no longer-- must go and sit in the shade."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="emma.c42.p36"><s sid="119" id="emma.c42.s119">Such, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only once by Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to inquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.-- She had some fears of his horse.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="emma.c42.p37" type="speech"><s sid="120" id="emma.c42.s120">Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.-- A situation, a most desirable situation, was in question.</s> <s sid="121" id="emma.c42.s121">Mrs. Elton had received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures.</s> <s sid="122" id="emma.c42.s122">It was not with Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them:  it was with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove.</s> <s sid="123" id="emma.c42.s123">Delightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every thing--and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.--On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she positively refused to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.-- Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow's post.--How Jane could bear it at all, was astonishing to Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--and at last, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a removal.-- <qs/>"Should not they walk?</s> <s sid="124" id="emma.c42.s124">Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens-- all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent."<qe/>--The pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="emma.c42.p38"><s sid="125" id="emma.c42.s125">It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered, dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.-- It led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars, which seemed intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an approach to the house, which never had been there.</s> <s sid="126" id="emma.c42.s126">Disputable, however, as might be the taste of such a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view which closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;-- and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered, rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river making a close and handsome curve around it.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="emma.c47.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="emma.c47.s1"><qs/>"Harriet, poor Harriet!"<qe/>--Those were the words; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted the real misery of the business to her.</s> <s sid="2" id="emma.c47.s2">Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much _his_ behaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him.</s> <s sid="3" id="emma.c47.s3">It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's account, that gave the deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery.</s> <s sid="4" id="emma.c47.s4">Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically, when he once said, <qs/>"Emma, you have been no friend to Harriet Smith."<qe/>--She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed.</s> <s sid="5" id="emma.c47.s5">She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments.</s> <s sid="6" id="emma.c47.s6">Her influence would have been enough.</s> <s sid="7" id="emma.c47.s7">And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been risking her friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds.</s> <s sid="8" id="emma.c47.s8">Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to think of him, and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--<qs/>"But, with common sense,"<qe/><sss/> she added, <sse/><qs/>"I am afraid I have had little to do."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c47.p2" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="emma.c47.s9">She was extremely angry with herself.</s> <s sid="10" id="emma.c47.s10">If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.-- As for Jane Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account.</s> <s sid="11" id="emma.c47.s11">Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil were over.--She would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous.-- Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted.</s> <s sid="12" id="emma.c47.s12">This discovery laid many smaller matters open.</s> <s sid="13" id="emma.c47.s13">No doubt it had been from jealousy.--In Jane's eyes she had been a rival; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed.</s> <s sid="14" id="emma.c47.s14">An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack, and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison.</s> <s sid="15" id="emma.c47.s15">She understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert.</s> <s sid="16" id="emma.c47.s16">But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge!</s> <s sid="17" id="emma.c47.s17">There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else.</s> <s sid="18" id="emma.c47.s18">Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.</s> <s sid="19" id="emma.c47.s19">Considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet's mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would.-- She must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon as possible.</s> <s sid="20" id="emma.c47.s20">An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston's parting words.</s> <s sid="21" id="emma.c47.s21"><qs/>"For the present, the whole affair was to be completely a secret.</s> <s sid="22" id="emma.c47.s22">Mr. Churchill had made a point of it, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost; and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum."<qe/>-- Emma had promised; but still Harriet must be excepted.</s> <s sid="23" id="emma.c47.s23">It was her superior duty.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c47.p3"><s sid="24" id="emma.c47.s24">In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself.</s> <s sid="25" id="emma.c47.s25">The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her, she was now to be anxiously announcing to another.</s> <s sid="26" id="emma.c47.s26">Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had poor Mrs. Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls.</s> <s sid="27" id="emma.c47.s27">Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!-- But of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c47.p4" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="emma.c47.s28"><qs/>"Well, Miss Woodhouse!"<qe/><sls/> cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room-- <sle/><qs/>"is not this the oddest news that ever was?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c47.p5" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="emma.c47.s29"><qs/>"What news do you mean?"<qe/> replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c47.p6" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="emma.c47.s30"><qs/>"About Jane Fairfax.</s> <s sid="31" id="emma.c47.s31">Did you ever hear any thing so strange?</s> <s sid="32" id="emma.c47.s32">Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me himself.</s> <s sid="33" id="emma.c47.s33">I met him just now.</s> <s sid="34" id="emma.c47.s34">He told me it was to be a great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you, but he said you knew it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="emma.c47.p7" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="emma.c47.s35"><qs/>"What did Mr. Weston tell you?"<qe/>--said Emma, still perplexed.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="emma.c47.p8" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="emma.c47.s36"><qs/>"Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while.</s> <s sid="37" id="emma.c47.s37">How very odd!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="emma.c47.p9"><s sid="38" id="emma.c47.s38">It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd, that Emma did not know how to understand it.</s> <s sid="39" id="emma.c47.s39">Her character appeared absolutely changed.</s> <s sid="40" id="emma.c47.s40">She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery.</s> <s sid="41" id="emma.c47.s41">Emma looked at her, quite unable to speak.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="emma.c47.p10" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="emma.c47.s42"><qs/>"Had you any idea,"<qe/><sss/> cried Harriet, <sse/><qs/>"of his being in love with her?--You, perhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke) who can see into every body's heart; but nobody else--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="emma.c47.p11" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="emma.c47.s43"><qs/>"Upon my word,"<qe/><sss/> said Emma, <sse/><qs/>"I begin to doubt my having any such talent.</s> <s sid="44" id="emma.c47.s44">Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not openly-- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank Churchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax.</s> <s sid="45" id="emma.c47.s45">You may be very sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="emma.c47.p12" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="emma.c47.s46"><qs/>"Me!"<qe/> cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished.</s> <s sid="47" id="emma.c47.s47"><qs/>"Why should you caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="emma.c47.p13" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="emma.c47.s48"><qs/>"I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,"<qe/><sss/> replied Emma, smiling; <sse/><qs/>"but you do not mean to deny that there was a time--and not very distant either--when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="emma.c47.p14" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="emma.c47.s49"><qs/>"Him!--never, never.</s> <s sid="50" id="emma.c47.s50">Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?"<qe/> turning away distressed.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="emma.c47.p15" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="emma.c47.s51"><qs/>"Harriet!"<qe/><sls/> cried Emma, after a moment's pause--<sle/><qs/>"What do you mean?-- Good Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="emma.c47.p16"><s sid="52" id="emma.c47.s52">She could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she sat down, waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="emma.c47.p17"><s sid="53" id="emma.c47.s53">Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="emma.c47.p18" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="emma.c47.s54"><qs/>"I should not have thought it possible,"<qe/><sss/> she began, <sse/><qs/>"that you could have misunderstood me!</s> <s sid="55" id="emma.c47.s55">I know we agreed never to name him-- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else, I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person.</s> <s sid="56" id="emma.c47.s56">Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed!</s> <s sid="57" id="emma.c47.s57">I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other.</s> <s sid="58" id="emma.c47.s58">I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side.</s> <s sid="59" id="emma.c47.s59">And that you should have been so mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost, to dare to think of him.</s> <s sid="60" id="emma.c47.s60">At first, if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been matches of greater disparity (those were your very words);-- I should not have dared to give way to--I should not have thought it possible--But if _you_, who had been always acquainted with him--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="emma.c47.p19" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="emma.c47.s61"><qs/>"Harriet!"<qe/><sls/> cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--<sle/><qs/>"Let us understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake.</s> <s sid="62" id="emma.c47.s62">Are you speaking of--Mr. Knightley?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="emma.c47.p20" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="emma.c47.s63"><qs/>"To be sure I am.</s> <s sid="64" id="emma.c47.s64">I never could have an idea of any body else-- and so I thought you knew.</s> <s sid="65" id="emma.c47.s65">When we talked about him, it was as clear as possible."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="emma.c47.p21" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="emma.c47.s66"><qs/>"Not quite,"<qe/><sls/> returned Emma, with forced calmness, <sle/><qs/>"for all that you then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person.</s> <s sid="67" id="emma.c47.s67">I could almost assert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill.</s> <s sid="68" id="emma.c47.s68">I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from the gipsies, was spoken of."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="emma.c47.p22" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="emma.c47.s69"><qs/>"Oh!</s> <s sid="70" id="emma.c47.s70">Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="emma.c47.p23" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="emma.c47.s71"><qs/>"My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion.</s> <s sid="72" id="emma.c47.s72">I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.--The impression of it is strong on my memory."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="emma.c47.p24" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="emma.c47.s73"><qs/>"Oh, dear,"<qe/><sss/> cried Harriet, <sse/><qs/>"now I recollect what you mean; but I was thinking of something very different at the time.</s> <s sid="74" id="emma.c47.s74">It was not the gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant.</s> <s sid="75" id="emma.c47.s75">No!</s> <s sid="76" id="emma.c47.s76">(with some elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance-- of Mr. Knightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room.</s> <s sid="77" id="emma.c47.s77">That was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="emma.c47.p25" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="emma.c47.s78"><qs/>"Good God!"<qe/><sss/> cried Emma, <sse/><qs/>"this has been a most unfortunate-- most deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="emma.c47.p27"><s sid="81" id="emma.c47.s81">She paused a few moments.</s> <s sid="82" id="emma.c47.s82">Emma could not speak.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="emma.c47.p28" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="emma.c47.s83"><qs/>"I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,"<qe/><sss/> she resumed, <sse/><qs/>"that you should feel a great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body.</s> <s sid="84" id="emma.c47.s84">You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other.</s> <s sid="85" id="emma.c47.s85">But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if-- strange as it may appear--.</s> <s sid="86" id="emma.c47.s86">But you know they were your own words, that _more_ wonderful things had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before-- and if I should be so fortunate, beyond expression, as to-- if Mr. Knightley should really--if _he_ does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in the way.</s> <s sid="87" id="emma.c47.s87">But you are too good for that, I am sure."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="emma.c47.p29"><s sid="88" id="emma.c47.s88">Harriet was standing at one of the windows.</s> <s sid="89" id="emma.c47.s89">Emma turned round to look at her in consternation, and hastily said,</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="emma.c47.p30" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="emma.c47.s90"><qs/>"Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="emma.c47.p31" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="emma.c47.s91"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/><sls/> replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--<sle/><qs/>"I must say that I have."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="emma.c47.p32"><s sid="92" id="emma.c47.s92">Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating, in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes.</s> <s sid="93" id="emma.c47.s93">A few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart.</s> <s sid="94" id="emma.c47.s94">A mind like hers, once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress.</s> <s sid="95" id="emma.c47.s95">She touched-- she admitted--she acknowledged the whole truth.</s> <s sid="96" id="emma.c47.s96">Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank Churchill?</s> <s sid="97" id="emma.c47.s97">Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet's having some hope of a return?</s> <s sid="98" id="emma.c47.s98">It darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself!</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="emma.c47.p33"><s sid="99" id="emma.c47.s99">Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same few minutes.</s> <s sid="100" id="emma.c47.s100">She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before.</s> <s sid="101" id="emma.c47.s101">How improperly had she been acting by Harriet!</s> <s sid="102" id="emma.c47.s102">How inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been her conduct!</s> <s sid="103" id="emma.c47.s103">What blindness, what madness, had led her on!</s> <s sid="104" id="emma.c47.s104">It struck her with dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world.</s> <s sid="105" id="emma.c47.s105">Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demerits-- some concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense of justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained--or to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her right.-- Rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.-- Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="emma.c47.p34"><s sid="106" id="emma.c47.s106">Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge, and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to give the history of her hopes with great, though trembling delight.--Emma's tremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were better concealed than Harriet's, but they were not less.</s> <s sid="107" id="emma.c47.s107">Her voice was not unsteady; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self, such a burst of threatening evil, such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.-- She listened with much inward suffering, but with great outward patience, to Harriet's detail.--Methodical, or well arranged, or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be; but it contained, when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her spirit-- especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own memory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="emma.c47.p35"><s sid="108" id="emma.c47.s108">Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had, on that occasion, found her much superior to his expectation.</s> <s sid="109" id="emma.c47.s109">From that evening, or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her to think of him, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it.</s> <s sid="110" id="emma.c47.s110">When they had been all walking together, he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her.</s> <s sid="111" id="emma.c47.s111">Emma knew it to have been very much the case.</s> <s sid="112" id="emma.c47.s112">She had often observed the change, to almost the same extent.-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him-- and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet.</s> <s sid="113" id="emma.c47.s113">He praised her for being without art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous, feelings.-- She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had dwelt on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet's memory, many little particulars of the notice she had received from him, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected, by Emma.</s> <s sid="114" id="emma.c47.s114">Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation, and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first, was his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came, and he had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from the rest to himself--and at first, he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush.)</s> <s sid="115" id="emma.c47.s115">He seemed to be almost asking her, whether her affections were engaged.-- But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them, he changed the subject, and began talking about farming:-- The second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of his being at Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said that he could not stay five minutes--and his having told her, during their conversation, that though he must go to London, it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all, which was much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_.</s> <s sid="116" id="emma.c47.s116">The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one article marked, gave her severe pain.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="emma.c47.p36"><s sid="117" id="emma.c47.s117">On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, after a little reflection, venture the following question.</s> <s sid="118" id="emma.c47.s118">"Might he not?--Is not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of your affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin-- he might have Mr. Martin's interest in view?</s> <s sid="119" id="emma.c47.s119">But Harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="emma.c47.p37" type="speech"><s sid="120" id="emma.c47.s120"><qs/>"Mr. Martin!</s> <s sid="121" id="emma.c47.s121">No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin.</s> <s sid="122" id="emma.c47.s122">I hope I know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="emma.c47.p38"><s sid="123" id="emma.c47.s123">When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear Miss Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="emma.c48.p1"><s sid="1" id="emma.c48.s1">Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley, first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so, and feeling it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had been.--Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no female connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella.</s> <s sid="2" id="emma.c48.s2">She had herself been first with him for many years past.</s> <s sid="3" id="emma.c48.s3">She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent or perverse, slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him, insensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own--but still, from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind, he had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour to improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no other creature had at all shared.</s> <s sid="4" id="emma.c48.s4">In spite of all her faults, she knew she was dear to him; might she not say, very dear?-- When the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow here, presented themselves, she could not presume to indulge them.</s> <s sid="5" id="emma.c48.s5">Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley.</s> <s sid="6" id="emma.c48.s6">_She_ could not.</s> <s sid="7" id="emma.c48.s7">She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to _her_.</s> <s sid="8" id="emma.c48.s8">She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.-- How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates!</s> <s sid="9" id="emma.c48.s9">How directly, how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!--Not too strongly for the offence--but far, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.-- She had no hope, nothing to deserve the name of hope, that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one, at times much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be overrating his regard for _her_.--Wish it she must, for his sake--be the consequence nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his life.</s> <s sid="10" id="emma.c48.s10">Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all, she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace would be fully secured.--Marriage, in fact, would not do for her.</s> <s sid="11" id="emma.c48.s11">It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what she felt for him.</s> <s sid="12" id="emma.c48.s12">Nothing should separate her from her father.</s> <s sid="13" id="emma.c48.s13">She would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c48.p2"><s sid="14" id="emma.c48.s14">It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.-- He was expected back every day.</s> <s sid="15" id="emma.c48.s15">The power of observation would be soon given--frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course.</s> <s sid="16" id="emma.c48.s16">In the meanwhile, she resolved against seeing Harriet.-- It would do neither of them good, it would do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet's confidence.</s> <s sid="17" id="emma.c48.s17">To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg that she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of _one_ topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of others--she objected only to a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and approved, and was grateful.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c48.p3"><s sid="18" id="emma.c48.s18">This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them, sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who had been calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c48.p4"><s sid="19" id="emma.c48.s19">Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="emma.c49.p40"><s sid="101" id="emma.c49.s101">He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence.</s> <s sid="102" id="emma.c49.s102">He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it.</s> <s sid="103" id="emma.c49.s103">He had come, in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's engagement, with no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed him an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest had been the work of the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings.</s> <s sid="104" id="emma.c49.s104">The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had given birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection himself;--but it had been no present hope--he had only, in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.--The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.-- The affection, which he had been asking to be allowed to create, if he could, was already his!--Within half an hour, he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to something so like perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="emma.c49.p41"><s sid="105" id="emma.c49.s105">_Her_ change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his side, there had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation, of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other.</s> <s sid="106" id="emma.c49.s106">It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the country.--The Box Hill party had decided him on going away.</s> <s sid="107" id="emma.c49.s107">He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted, encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be indifferent.-- But he had gone to a wrong place.</s> <s sid="108" id="emma.c49.s108">There was too much domestic happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form in it; Isabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those striking inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before him, for much to have been done, even had his time been longer.--He had stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day--till this very morning's post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then, with the gladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel, having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma, was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her, that he could stay no longer.</s> <s sid="109" id="emma.c49.s109">He had ridden home through the rain; and had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults, bore the discovery.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="emma.c50.p1"><s sid="1" id="emma.c50.s1">What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering;--she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c50.p2"><s sid="2" id="emma.c50.s2">They sat down to tea--the same party round the same table-- how often it had been collected!--and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun!--But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive daughter.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c50.p3"><s sid="3" id="emma.c50.s3">Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could he have seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil, without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either, he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c50.p4"><s sid="4" id="emma.c50.s4">As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued; but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax for such an evening, she found one or two such very serious points to consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have some alloy.</s> <s sid="5" id="emma.c50.s5">Her father--and Harriet.</s> <s sid="6" id="emma.c50.s6">She could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question.</s> <s sid="7" id="emma.c50.s7">With respect to her father, it was a question soon answered.</s> <s sid="8" id="emma.c50.s8">She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father.--She even wept over the idea of it, as a sin of thought.</s> <s sid="9" id="emma.c50.s9">While he lived, it must be only an engagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.-- How to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;-- how to spare her from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement; how to appear least her enemy?-- On these subjects, her perplexity and distress were very great-- and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.-- She could only resolve at last, that she would still avoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by letter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme more-- nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet; and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.-- She did not think it in Harriet's nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.-- At any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the evil day, when they must all be together again.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c50.p5"><s sid="10" id="emma.c50.s10">She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment which left her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him, literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c50.p6"><s sid="11" id="emma.c50.s11">He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was brought her from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she guessed what it must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.-- She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted no explanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself-- and as for understanding any thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable of it.--It must be waded through, however.</s> <s sid="12" id="emma.c50.s12">She opened the packet; it was too surely so;--a note from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston.</s> </p>

you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards.</s> <s sid="21" id="emma.c50.s21">This was the fact.</s> <s sid="22" id="emma.c50.s22">My right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another question.</s> <s sid="23" id="emma.c50.s23">I shall not discuss it here.</s> <s sid="24" id="emma.c50.s24">For my temptation to _think_ it a right, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below, and casements above, in Highbury.</s> <s sid="25" id="emma.c50.s25">I dared not address her openly; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.-- Had she refused, I should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say, what was your hope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?-- To any thing, every thing--to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts, perseverance and weariness, health and sickness.</s> <s sid="26" id="emma.c50.s26">Every possibility of good was before me, and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence.</s> <s sid="27" id="emma.c50.s27">If you need farther explanation, I have the honour, my dear madam, of being your husband's son, and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good, which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of.--See me, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit to Randalls;--and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have been sooner paid.</s> <s sid="28" id="emma.c50.s28">You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as _you_ were the person slighted, you will forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father's compassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from his house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you.</s> <s sid="29" id="emma.c50.s29">My behaviour, during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, I hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point.</s> <s sid="30" id="emma.c50.s30">And now I come to the principal, the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or requires very solicitous explanation.</s> <s sid="31" id="emma.c50.s31">With the greatest respect, and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.-- A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion, and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.-- In order to assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.--I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object--but I am sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference, I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.-- Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me, was as much my conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.</s> <s sid="32" id="emma.c50.s32">We seemed to understand each other.</s> <s sid="33" id="emma.c50.s33">From our relative situation, those attentions were her due, and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight, I cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her, I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not without suspicion; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me, at least in some degree.-- She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must have penetrated a part.</s> <s sid="34" id="emma.c50.s34">I cannot doubt it.</s> <s sid="35" id="emma.c50.s35">You will find, whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it did not take her wholly by surprize.</s> <s sid="36" id="emma.c50.s36">She frequently gave me hints of it.</s> <s sid="37" id="emma.c50.s37">I remember her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.-- I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss.</s> <s sid="38" id="emma.c50.s38">While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either.</s> <s sid="39" id="emma.c50.s39">Acquit me here, and procure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly affection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.-- Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight, you have now a key to.</s> <s sid="40" id="emma.c50.s40">My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.</s> <s sid="41" id="emma.c50.s41">If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.-- Of the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would never have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.-- The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to.</s> <s sid="42" id="emma.c50.s42">You will soon, I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly yourself.-- No description can describe her.</s> <s sid="43" id="emma.c50.s43">She must tell you herself what she is-- yet not by word, for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.--Since I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from her.-- She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never complains, I dare not depend.</s> <s sid="44" id="emma.c50.s44">I want to have your opinion of her looks.</s> <s sid="45" id="emma.c50.s45">I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit.</s> <s sid="46" id="emma.c50.s46">Perhaps it is paid already.</s> <s sid="47" id="emma.c50.s47">Let me hear from you without delay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars.</s> <s sid="48" id="emma.c50.s48">Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness or misery.</s> <s sid="49" id="emma.c50.s49">When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of her excellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad with joy:  but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger.</s> <s sid="50" id="emma.c50.s50">If I could but see her again!--But I must not propose it yet.</s> <s sid="51" id="emma.c50.s51">My uncle has been too good for me to encroach.--I must still add to this long letter.</s> <s sid="52" id="emma.c50.s52">You have not heard all that you ought to hear.</s> <s sid="53" id="emma.c50.s53">I could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me the happiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early measures, but from the very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose.</s> <s sid="54" id="emma.c50.s54">I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.-- But I had no choice.</s> <s sid="55" id="emma.c50.s55">The hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect for me.</s> <s sid="56" id="emma.c50.s56">I behaved shamefully.</s> <s sid="57" id="emma.c50.s57">And here I can admit, that my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly blameable.</s> <s sid="58" id="emma.c50.s58">_She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was displeased;

I met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her, but she would not suffer it.</s> <s sid="64" id="emma.c50.s64">She absolutely refused to allow me, which I then thought most unreasonable.</s> <s sid="65" id="emma.c50.s65">Now, however, I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion.</s> <s sid="66" id="emma.c50.s66">While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman, was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless?--Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.-- I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted her affection.</s> <s sid="67" id="emma.c50.s67">I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her, and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.-- In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with you till the next morning, merely because I would be as angry with her as possible.</s> <s sid="68" id="emma.c50.s68">Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time; but I was the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went away determined that she should make the first advances.--I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party.</s> <s sid="69" id="emma.c50.s69">Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again.</s> <s sid="70" id="emma.c50.s70">Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced:  as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her, by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred.</s> <s sid="71" id="emma.c50.s71">I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known.-- `Jane,' indeed!--You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you.</s> <s sid="72" id="emma.c50.s72">Think, then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the insolence of imaginary superiority.</s> <s sid="73" id="emma.c50.s73">Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.-- She closed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely, and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.-- _She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_:</s> <s sid="74" id="emma.c50.s74">_she_ _dissolved_ _it_.--This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt's death.</s> <s sid="75" id="emma.c50.s75">I answered it within an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had written enough, though but a few lines, to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.--I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily; but I made excuses for her, and was too busy, and--may I add?-- too cheerful in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters all returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post, stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested, that if I could not directly command hers, so as to send them to Highbury within a week, I would forward them after that period to her at--:  in short, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge's, near Bristol, stared me in the face.</s> <s sid="76" id="emma.c50.s76">I knew the name, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had been doing.</s> <s sid="77" id="emma.c50.s77">It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess;

circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened away his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man! with a deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.--I felt that it would be of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him, for my suspense while all was at stake?--No; do not pity me till I reached Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her.</s> <s sid="80" id="emma.c50.s80">Do not pity me till I saw her wan, sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance of finding her alone.--I was not disappointed;

<p pid="2" id="emma.c51.p2"><s sid="5" id="emma.c51.s5">She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again, she desired him to read it.</s> <s sid="6" id="emma.c51.s6">She was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen so much to blame in his conduct.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c51.p3" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="emma.c51.s7"><qs/>"I shall be very glad to look it over,"<qe/><sss/> said he; <sse/><qs/>"but it seems long.</s> <s sid="8" id="emma.c51.s8">I will take it home with me at night."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c51.p4"><s sid="9" id="emma.c51.s9">But that would not do.</s> <s sid="10" id="emma.c51.s10">Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she must return it by him.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c51.p5" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="emma.c51.s11"><qs/>"I would rather be talking to you,"<qe/><sss/> he replied; <sse/><qs/>"but as it seems a matter of justice, it shall be done."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c51.p6" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="emma.c51.s12">He began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, <qs/>"Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a few months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="emma.c51.p7" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="emma.c51.s13">He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a smile, observed, <qs/>"Humph! a fine complimentary opening:</s> <s sid="14" id="emma.c51.s14">But it is his way.</s> <s sid="15" id="emma.c51.s15">One man's style must not be the rule of another's.</s> <s sid="16" id="emma.c51.s16">We will not be severe."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="emma.c51.p8" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="emma.c51.s17"><qs/>"It will be natural for me,"<qe/><sss/> he added shortly afterwards, <sse/><qs/>"to speak my opinion aloud as I read.</s> <s sid="18" id="emma.c51.s18">By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.</s> <s sid="19" id="emma.c51.s19">It will not be so great a loss of time:  but if you dislike it--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="emma.c51.p10"><s sid="22" id="emma.c51.s22">Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="emma.c51.p11" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="emma.c51.s23"><qs/>"He trifles here,"<qe/><sss/> said he, <sse/><qs/>"as to the temptation.</s> <s sid="24" id="emma.c51.s24">He knows he is wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought not to have formed the engagement.--`His father's disposition:'-- he is unjust, however, to his father.</s> <s sid="25" id="emma.c51.s25">Mr. Weston's sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.--Very true; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="emma.c51.p12" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="emma.c51.s26"><qs/>"And I have not forgotten,"<qe/><sss/> said Emma, <sse/><qs/>"how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would.</s> <s sid="27" id="emma.c51.s27">You pass it over very handsomely-- but you were perfectly right."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="emma.c51.p14"><s sid="29" id="emma.c51.s29">When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud--all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of the head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as the subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady reflection, thus--</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="emma.c51.p15" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="emma.c51.s30"><qs/>"Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most dangerous game.</s> <s sid="31" id="emma.c51.s31">Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.-- No judge of his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his own wishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.-- Fancying you to have fathomed his secret.</s> <s sid="32" id="emma.c51.s32">Natural enough!-- his own mind full of intrigue, that he should suspect it in others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert the understanding!</s> <s sid="33" id="emma.c51.s33">My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="emma.c51.p16"><s sid="34" id="emma.c51.s34">Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account, which she could not give any sincere explanation of.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="emma.c51.p17" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="emma.c51.s35"><qs/>"You had better go on,"<qe/> said she.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="emma.c51.p18" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="emma.c51.s36">He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, <qs/>"the pianoforte!</s> <s sid="37" id="emma.c51.s37">Ah!</s> <s sid="38" id="emma.c51.s38">That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure.</s> <s sid="39" id="emma.c51.s39">A boyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot comprehend a man's wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument's coming if she could."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="emma.c51.p19"><s sid="40" id="emma.c51.s40">After this, he made some progress without any pause.</s> <s sid="41" id="emma.c51.s41">Frank Churchill's confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="emma.c51.p20" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="emma.c51.s42"><qs/>"I perfectly agree with you, sir,"<qe/>--was then his remark.</s> <s sid="43" id="emma.c51.s43"><qs/>"You did behave very shamefully.</s> <s sid="44" id="emma.c51.s44">You never wrote a truer line."<qe/></s> <s sid="45" id="emma.c51.s45">And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right, he made a fuller pause to say, <qs/>"This is very bad.--He had induced her to place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could.</s> <s sid="46" id="emma.c51.s46">He should have respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers were all reasonable.</s> <s sid="47" id="emma.c51.s47">We must look to her one fault, and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="emma.c51.p21"><s sid="48" id="emma.c51.s48">Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew uncomfortable.</s> <s sid="49" id="emma.c51.s49">Her own behaviour had been so very improper!</s> <s sid="50" id="emma.c51.s50">She was deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look.</s> <s sid="51" id="emma.c51.s51">It was all read, however, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and, excepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving pain--no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="emma.c51.p22" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="emma.c51.s52"><qs/>"There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the Eltons,"<qe/><sss/> was his next observation.--<sse/><qs/>"His feelings are natural.-- What! actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each-- she dissolved it.--What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!--Well, he must be a most extraordinary--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="emma.c51.p23" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="emma.c51.s53"><qs/>"Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he suffers."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="emma.c51.p24" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="emma.c51.s54"><qs/>"I hope he does,"<qe/> replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter.</s> <s sid="55" id="emma.c51.s55"><qs/>"`Smallridge!'--What does this mean?</s> <s sid="56" id="emma.c51.s56">What is all this?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="emma.c51.p27" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="emma.c51.s62"><qs/>"I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="emma.c51.p31" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="emma.c51.s77">The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the happiness of her father.</s> <s sid="78" id="emma.c51.s78">Emma's answer was ready at the first word.</s> <s sid="79" id="emma.c51.s79"><qs/>"While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible for her.</s> <s sid="80" id="emma.c51.s80">She could never quit him."<qe/></s> <s sid="81" id="emma.c51.s81">Part only of this answer, however, was admitted.</s> <s sid="82" id="emma.c51.s82">The impossibility of her quitting her father, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility of any other change, he could not agree to.</s> <s sid="83" id="emma.c51.s83">He had been thinking it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his persuasion, that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father's comfort, perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded.</s> <s sid="84" id="emma.c51.s84">Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!--No, he felt that it ought not to be attempted.</s> <s sid="85" id="emma.c51.s85">But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable; it was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as her father's happiness in other words his life--required Hartfield to continue her home, it should be his likewise.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="emma.c51.p32"><s sid="86" id="emma.c51.s86">Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own passing thoughts.</s> <s sid="87" id="emma.c51.s87">Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her.</s> <s sid="88" id="emma.c51.s88">She was sensible of all the affection it evinced.</s> <s sid="89" id="emma.c51.s89">She felt that, in quitting Donwell, he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that in living constantly with her father, and in no house of his own, there would be much, very much, to be borne with.</s> <s sid="90" id="emma.c51.s90">She promised to think of it, and advised him to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject.</s> <s sid="91" id="emma.c51.s91">He had given it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning, to have his thoughts to himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="emma.c51.p33" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="emma.c51.s92"><qs/>"Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,"<qe/> cried Emma.</s> <s sid="93" id="emma.c51.s93"><qs/>"I am sure William Larkins will not like it.</s> <s sid="94" id="emma.c51.s94">You must get his consent before you ask mine."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="emma.c51.p34"><s sid="95" id="emma.c51.s95">She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="emma.c51.p35"><s sid="96" id="emma.c51.s96">It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights as heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded.</s> <s sid="97" id="emma.c51.s97">Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="emma.c51.p36"><s sid="98" id="emma.c51.s98">This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield-- the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.</s> <s sid="99" id="emma.c51.s99">His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their mutual good to outweigh every drawback.</s> <s sid="100" id="emma.c51.s100">Such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!-- Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy!</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="emma.c51.p37"><s sid="101" id="emma.c51.s101">She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield.</s> <s sid="102" id="emma.c51.s102">The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a distance from.</s> <s sid="103" id="emma.c51.s103">She would be a loser in every way.</s> <s sid="104" id="emma.c51.s104">Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment.</s> <s sid="105" id="emma.c51.s105">In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="emma.c51.p38"><s sid="106" id="emma.c51.s106">In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is, supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early.</s> <s sid="107" id="emma.c51.s107">Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;-- not like Mr. Elton.</s> <s sid="108" id="emma.c51.s108">Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she could be in love with more than _three_ men in one year.</s> </p></div>

<title>CHAPTER XVI</title>

<p pid="1" id="emma.c52.p1"><s sid="1" id="emma.c52.s1">It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting.</s> <s sid="2" id="emma.c52.s2">Their intercourse was painful enough by letter.</s> <s sid="3" id="emma.c52.s3">How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c52.p2"><s sid="4" id="emma.c52.s4">Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in her style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.-- It might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c52.p3"><s sid="5" id="emma.c52.s5">She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss.</s> <s sid="6" id="emma.c52.s6">Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist.</s> <s sid="7" id="emma.c52.s7">Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her--and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister's side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.-- Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was all arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c52.p4"><s sid="8" id="emma.c52.s8">Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she could talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c52.p5"><s sid="9" id="emma.c52.s9">The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment, which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c52.p6"><s sid="10" id="emma.c52.s10">She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had occupied.</s> <s sid="11" id="emma.c52.s11">There was a communication before her, one which _she_ only could be competent to make-- the confession of her engagement to her father; but she would have nothing to do with it at present.--She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well.</s> <s sid="12" id="emma.c52.s12">No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved-- and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="emma.c52.p7"><s sid="13" id="emma.c52.s13">She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.-- She ought to go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill.</s> <s sid="14" id="emma.c52.s14">It would be a _secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="emma.c52.p8" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="emma.c52.s15">She went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.-- The fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.-- She heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No; she heard nothing but the instant reply of, <qs/>"Beg her to walk up;"<qe/>--and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.-- Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging.</s> <s sid="16" id="emma.c52.s16">There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.-- She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very feeling tone,</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="emma.c52.p9" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="emma.c52.s17"><qs/>"This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being so entirely without words."<qe/></s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER XIX</title>

<p pid="1" id="emma.c55.p1"><s sid="1" id="emma.c55.s1">If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty.</s> <s sid="2" id="emma.c55.s2">A very few days brought the party from London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable as it was!-- that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley, and was now forming all her views of happiness.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="emma.c55.p2"><s sid="3" id="emma.c55.s3">Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first: but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend's approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.-- Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley's, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.</s> <s sid="4" id="emma.c55.s4">But what did such particulars explain?-- The fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible to Emma.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="emma.c55.p3"><s sid="5" id="emma.c55.s5">The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known.</s> <s sid="6" id="emma.c55.s6">She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!-- It was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman:  but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley--or for the Churchills--or even for Mr. Elton!-- The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="emma.c55.p4"><s sid="7" id="emma.c55.s7">No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was treated liberally; it was all as it should be:  and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend.</s> <s sid="8" id="emma.c55.s8">She had no doubt of Harriet's happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he offered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and improvement.</s> <s sid="9" id="emma.c55.s9">She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness.</s> <s sid="10" id="emma.c55.s10">She would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find her out.</s> <s sid="11" id="emma.c55.s11">She would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;--or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="emma.c55.p5"><s sid="12" id="emma.c55.s12">Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins, was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.-- The intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural manner.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="emma.c55.p6"><s sid="13" id="emma.c55.s13">Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them, could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="emma.c55.p7"><s sid="14" id="emma.c55.s14">Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills were also in town; and they were only waiting for November.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="emma.c55.p8"><s sid="15" id="emma.c55.s15">The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside, which was the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in approving it.</s> <s sid="16" id="emma.c55.s16">But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced to consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="emma.c55.p9"><s sid="17" id="emma.c55.s17">When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they were almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.-- He began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it-- a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation.</s> <s sid="18" id="emma.c55.s18">Still, however, he was not happy.</s> <s sid="19" id="emma.c55.s19">Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughter's courage failed.</s> <s sid="20" id="emma.c55.s20">She could not bear to see him suffering, to know him fancying himself neglected; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that when once the event were over, his distress would be soon over too, she hesitated--she could not proceed.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="emma.c55.p10"><s sid="21" id="emma.c55.s21">In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden illumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his nervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another way.-- Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeys-- evidently by the ingenuity of man.</s> <s sid="22" id="emma.c55.s22">Other poultry-yards in the neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr. Woodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life.</s> <s sid="23" id="emma.c55.s23">The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence.</s> <s sid="24" id="emma.c55.s24">While either of them protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.-- But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in November.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="emma.c55.p11"><s sid="25" id="emma.c55.s25">The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary, cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was called on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="emma.c55.p12" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="emma.c55.s26">The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very inferior to her own.--<qs/>"Very little white satin, very few lace veils; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she heard of it."<qe/>--But, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union.</s> </p>
