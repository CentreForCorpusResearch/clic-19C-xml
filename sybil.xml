<stru>SYBIL, OR THE TWO NATIONS



by Benjamin Disraeli</stru>









<stru>I would inscribe these volumes to one whose noble spirit and

gentle nature ever prompt her to sympathise with the

suffering; to one whose sweet voice has often encouraged, and

whose taste and judgment have ever guided, their pages; the

most severe of critics, but--a perfect Wife!</stru>









<stru>Advertisement







The general reader whose attention has not been specially

drawn to the subject which these volumes aim to illustrate,

the Condition of the People, might suspect that the Writer had

been tempted to some exaggeration in the scenes which he has

drawn and the impressions which he has wished to convey.  He

thinks it therefore due to himself to state that he believes

there is not a trait in this work for which he has not the

authority of his own observation, or the authentic evidence

which has been received by Royal Commissions and Parliamentary

Committees.  But while he hopes he has alleged nothing which

is not true, he has found the absolute necessity of

suppressing much that is genuine.  For so little do we know of

the state of our own country that the air of improbability

that the whole truth would inevitably throw over these pages,

might deter many from their perusal.

<p pid="14" id="sybil.c1.p14"><s sid="19" id="sybil.c1.s19">So saying, the companions, taking their course through more than one chamber, entered an apartment of less dimensions than the principal saloon, but not less sumptuous in its general appearance.</s> <s sid="20" id="sybil.c1.s20">The gleaming lustres poured a flood of soft yet brilliant light over a plateau glittering with gold plate, and fragrant with exotics embedded in vases of rare porcelain.</s> <s sid="21" id="sybil.c1.s21">The seats on each side of the table were occupied by persons consuming, with a heedless air, delicacies for which they had no appetite; while the conversation in general consisted of flying phrases referring to the impending event of the great day that had already dawned.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="sybil.c1.p52" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="sybil.c1.s78"><qs/>"By Jove!  that's a flash,"<qe/> exclaimed Lord Milford, as a blaze of lightning seemed to suffuse the chamber, and the beaming lustres turned white and ghastly in the glare.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="sybil.c1.p54"><s sid="86" id="sybil.c1.s86">Another flash, another explosion, the hissing noise of rain.</s> <s sid="87" id="sybil.c1.s87">Lord Milford moved aside, and jealous of the eye of another, read a letter from Chifney, and in a few minutes afterwards offered to take the odds against Pocket Hercules.</s> <s sid="88" id="sybil.c1.s88">Mr Latour walked to the window, surveyed the heavens, sighed that there was not time to send his tiger from the door to Epsom, and get information whether the storm had reached the Surrey hills, for to-night's operations.</s> <s sid="89" id="sybil.c1.s89">It was too late.</s> <s sid="90" id="sybil.c1.s90">So he took a rusk and a glass of lemonade, and retired to rest with a cool head and a cooler heart.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="sybil.c1.p55"><s sid="91" id="sybil.c1.s91">The storm raged, the incessant flash played as it were round the burnished cornice of the chamber, and threw a lurid hue on the scenes of Watteau and Boucher that sparkled in the medallions over the lofty doors.</s> <s sid="92" id="sybil.c1.s92">The thunderbolts seemed to descend in clattering confusion upon the roof.</s> <s sid="93" id="sybil.c1.s93">Sometimes there was a moment of dead silence, broken only by the pattering of the rain in the street without, or the pattering of the dice in a chamber at hand.</s> <s sid="94" id="sybil.c1.s94">Then horses were backed, bets made, and there were loud and frequent calls for brimming goblets from hurrying waiters, distracted by the lightning and deafened by the peal.</s> <s sid="95" id="sybil.c1.s95">It seemed a scene and a supper where the marble guest of Juan might have been expected, and had he arrived, he would have found probably hearts as bold and spirits as reckless as he encountered in Andalusia.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="1" id="sybil.c5.p1"><s sid="1" id="sybil.c5.s1">Lord Marney left several children; his heir was five years older than the next son Charles who at the period of his father's death was at Christchurch and had just entered the last year of his minority.</s> <s sid="2" id="sybil.c5.s2">Attaining that age, he received the sum of fifteen thousand pounds, his portion, a third of which amount his expenditure had then already anticipated.</s> <s sid="3" id="sybil.c5.s3">Egremont had been brought up in the enjoyment of every comfort and every luxury that refinement could devise and wealth furnish.</s> <s sid="4" id="sybil.c5.s4">He was a favourite child.</s> <s sid="5" id="sybil.c5.s5">His parents emulated each other in pampering and indulging him.</s> <s sid="6" id="sybil.c5.s6">Every freak was pardoned, every whim was gratified.</s> <s sid="7" id="sybil.c5.s7">He might ride what horses he liked, and if he broke their knees, what in another would have been deemed a flagrant sin, was in him held only a proof of reckless spirit.</s> <s sid="8" id="sybil.c5.s8">If he were not a thoroughly selfish and altogether wilful person, but very much the reverse, it was not the fault of his parents, but rather the operation of a benignant nature that had bestowed on him a generous spirit and a tender heart, though accompanied with a dangerous susceptibility that made him the child and creature of impulse, and seemed to set at defiance even the course of time to engraft on his nature any quality of prudence.</s> <s sid="9" id="sybil.c5.s9">The tone of Eton during the days of Charles Egremont was not of the high character which at present distinguishes that community.</s> <s sid="10" id="sybil.c5.s10">It was the unforeseen eve of the great change, that, whatever was its purpose or have been its immediate results, at least gave the first shock to the pseudo-aristocracy of this country.</s> <s sid="11" id="sybil.c5.s11">Then all was blooming; sunshine and odour; not a breeze disturbing the meridian splendour.</s> <s sid="12" id="sybil.c5.s12">Then the world was not only made for a few, but a very few.</s> <s sid="13" id="sybil.c5.s13">One could almost tell upon one's fingers the happy families who could do anything, and might have everything.</s> <s sid="14" id="sybil.c5.s14">A school-boy's ideas of the Church then were fat-livings, and of the State, rotten-boroughs.</s> <s sid="15" id="sybil.c5.s15">To do nothing and get something, formed a boy's ideal of a manly career.</s> <s sid="16" id="sybil.c5.s16">There was nothing in the lot, little in the temperament, of Charles Egremont, to make him an exception to the multitude.</s> <s sid="17" id="sybil.c5.s17">Gaily and securely he floated on the brilliant stream.</s> <s sid="18" id="sybil.c5.s18">Popular at school, idolized at home, the present had no cares, and the future secured him a family seat in Parliament the moment he entered life, and the inheritance of a glittering post at court in due time, as its legitimate consequence.</s> <s sid="19" id="sybil.c5.s19">Enjoyment, not ambition, seemed the principle of his existence.</s> <s sid="20" id="sybil.c5.s20">The contingency of a mitre, the certainty of rich preferment, would not reconcile him to the self-sacrifice which, to a certain degree, was required from a priest, even in those days of rampant Erastianism.</s> <s sid="21" id="sybil.c5.s21">He left the colonies as the spoil of his younger brothers; his own ideas of a profession being limited to a barrack in a London park, varied by visits to Windsor.</s> <s sid="22" id="sybil.c5.s22">But there was time enough to think of these things.</s> <s sid="23" id="sybil.c5.s23">He had to enjoy Oxford as he had enjoyed Eton.</s> <s sid="24" id="sybil.c5.s24">Here his allowance from his father was extravagant, though greatly increased by tithes from his mother's pin-money.</s> <s sid="25" id="sybil.c5.s25">While he was pursuing his studies, hunting and boating, driving tandems, riding matches, tempering his energies in the crapulence of boyish banquets, and anticipating life, at the risk of expulsion, in a miserable mimicry of metropolitan dissipation, Dukism, that was supposed to be eternal, suddenly crashed.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="sybil.c5.p2"><s sid="26" id="sybil.c5.s26">The Reform Act has not placed the administration of our affairs in abler hands than conducted them previously to the passing of the measure, for the most efficient members of the present cabinet with some very few exceptions, and those attended by peculiar circumstances, were ministers before the Reform Act was contemplated.</s> <s sid="27" id="sybil.c5.s27">Nor has that memorable statute created a Parliament of a higher reputation for public qualities, such as politic ability, and popular eloquence, and national consideration, than was furnished by the old scheme.</s> <s sid="28" id="sybil.c5.s28">On the contrary; one house of Parliament has been irremediably degraded into the decaying position of a mere court of registry, possessing great privileges, on condition that it never exercises them; while the other chamber that, at the first blush, and to the superficial, exhibits symptons of almost unnatural vitality, engrossing in its orbit all the business of the country, assumes on a more studious inspection somewhat of the character of a select vestry, fulfilling municipal rather than imperial offices, and beleaguered by critical and clamorous millions, who cannot comprehend why a privileged and exclusive senate is required to perform functions which immediately concern all, which most personally comprehend, and which many in their civic spheres believe they could accomplish in a manner not less satisfactory, though certainly less ostentatious.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="sybil.c5.p3"><s sid="29" id="sybil.c5.s29">But if it have not furnished us with abler administrators or a more illustrious senate, the Reform Act may have exercised on the country at large a beneficial influence.</s> <s sid="30" id="sybil.c5.s30">Has it?</s> <s sid="31" id="sybil.c5.s31">Has it elevated the tone of the public mind?</s> <s sid="32" id="sybil.c5.s32">Has it cultured the popular sensibilities to noble and ennobling ends?</s> <s sid="33" id="sybil.c5.s33">Has it proposed to the people of England a higher test of national respect and confidence than the debasing qualification universally prevalent in this country since the fatal introduction of the system of Dutch finance?</s> <s sid="34" id="sybil.c5.s34">Who will pretend it?</s> <s sid="35" id="sybil.c5.s35">If a spirit of rapacious coveteousness, desecrating all the humanities of life, has been the besetting sin of England for the last century and a half, since the passing of the Reform Act the altar of Mammon has blazed with triple worship.</s> <s sid="36" id="sybil.c5.s36">To acquire, to accumulate, to plunder each other by virtue of philosophic phrases, to propose an Utopia to consist only of WEALTH and TOIL, this has been the breathless business of enfranchised England for the last twelve years, until we are startled from our voracious strife by the wail of intolerable serfage.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="sybil.c5.p4"><s sid="37" id="sybil.c5.s37">Are we then to conclude, that the only effect of the Reform Act has been to create in this country another of those class interests, which we now so loudly accuse as the obstacles to general amelioration?</s> <s sid="38" id="sybil.c5.s38">Not exactly that.</s> <s sid="39" id="sybil.c5.s39">The indirect influence of the Reform Act has been not inconsiderable, and may eventually lead to vast consequences.</s> <s sid="40" id="sybil.c5.s40">It set men a- thinking; it enlarged the horizon of political experience; it led the public mind to ponder somewhat on the circumstances of our national history; to pry into the beginnings of some social anomalies which they found were not so ancient as they had been led to believe, and which had their origin in causes very different to what they had been educated to credit; and insensibly it created and prepared a popular intelligence to which one can appeal, no longer hopelessly, in an attempt to dispel the mysteries with which for nearly three centuries it has been the labour of party writers to involve a national history, and without the dispersion of which no political position can be understood and no social evil remedied.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="sybil.c5.p5" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="sybil.c5.s41">The events of 1830 did not produce any change in the modes of thought and life of Charles Egremont.</s> <s sid="42" id="sybil.c5.s42">He took his political cue from his mother, who was his constant correspondent.</s> <s sid="43" id="sybil.c5.s43">Lady Marney was a distinguished <qs/>"stateswoman,"<qe/> as they called Lady Carlisle in Charles the First's time, a great friend of Lady St Julians, and one of the most eminent and impassioned votaries of Dukism.</s> <s sid="44" id="sybil.c5.s44">Her first impression on the overthrow of her hero was, astonishment at the impertinence of his adversaries, mingled with some lofty pity for their silly ambition and short-lived career.</s> <s sid="45" id="sybil.c5.s45">She existed for a week in the delightful expectation of his grace being sent for again, and informed every one in confidence, that <qs/>"these people could not form a cabinet."<qe/></s> <s sid="46" id="sybil.c5.s46">When the tocsin of peace, reform, and retrenchment sounded, she smiled bitterly; was sorry for poor Lord Grey of whom she had thought better, and gave them a year, adding with consoling malice, <qs/>"that it would be another Canning affair."<qe/></s> <s sid="47" id="sybil.c5.s47">At length came the Reform Bill itself, and no one laughed more heartily than Lady Marney; not even the House of Commons to whom it was presented.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="sybil.c5.p6"><s sid="48" id="sybil.c5.s48">The bill was thrown out, and Lady Marney gave a grand ball to celebrate the event, and to compensate the London shopkeepers for the loss of their projected franchise.</s> <s sid="49" id="sybil.c5.s49">Lady Marney was preparing to resume her duties at court when to her great surprise the firing of cannon announced the dissolution of Parliament.</s> <s sid="50" id="sybil.c5.s50">She turned pale; she was too much in the secrets of Tadpole and Taper to be deceived as to the consequences; she sank into her chair, and denounced Lord Grey as a traitor to his order.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="sybil.c5.p7"><s sid="51" id="sybil.c5.s51">Lady Marney who for six months had been writing to her son at Oxford the most charming letters, full of fun, quizzing the whole Cabinet, now announced to Egremont that a revolution was inevitable, that all property would be instantly confiscated, the poor deluded king led to the block or sent over to Hanover at the best, and the whole of the nobility and principal gentry, and indeed every one who possessed anything, guillotined without remorse.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="sybil.c5.p8"><s sid="52" id="sybil.c5.s52">Whether his friends were immediately to resume power, or whether their estates ultimately were to be confiscated, the practical conclusion to Charles Egremont appeared to he the same.</s> <s sid="53" id="sybil.c5.s53">Carpe diem.</s> <s sid="54" id="sybil.c5.s54">He therefore pursued his career at Oxford unchanged, and entered life in the year 1833, a younger son with extravagant tastes and expensive habits, with a reputation for lively talents though uncultivated,--for his acquisitions at Eton had been quite puerile, and subsequently he had not become a student,--with many manly accomplishments, and with a mien and visage that at once took the fancy and enlisted the affections.</s> <s sid="55" id="sybil.c5.s55">Indeed a physiologist would hardly have inferred from the countenance and structure of Egremont the career he had pursued, or the character which attached to him.</s> <s sid="56" id="sybil.c5.s56">The general cast and expression of his features when in repose was pensive: an air of refinement distinguished his well-moulded brow; his mouth breathed sympathy, and his rich brown eye gleamed with tenderness.</s> <s sid="57" id="sybil.c5.s57">The sweetness of his voice in speaking was in harmony with this organization.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="sybil.c5.p9"><s sid="58" id="sybil.c5.s58">Two years passed in the most refined circles of our society exercised a beneficial influence on the general tone of Egremont, and may be said to have finished his education.</s> <s sid="59" id="sybil.c5.s59">He had the good sense and the good taste not to permit his predilection for sports to degenerate into slang; he yielded himself to the delicate and profitable authority of woman, and, as ever happens, it softened his manners and brightened his wit.</s> <s sid="60" id="sybil.c5.s60">He was fortunate in having a clever mother, and he appreciated this inestimable possession.</s> <s sid="61" id="sybil.c5.s61">Lady Marney had great knowledge of society, and some acquaintance with human nature, which she fancied she had fathomed to its centre; she piqued herself upon her tact, and indeed she was very quick, but she was so energetic that her art did not always conceal itself; very worldly, she was nevertheless not devoid of impulse; she was animated and would have been extremely agreeable, if she had not restlessly aspired to wit; and would certainly have exercised much more influence in society, if she had not been so anxious to show it.</s> <s sid="62" id="sybil.c5.s62">Nevertheless, still with many personal charms, a frank and yet, if need be, a finished manner, a quick brain, a lively tongue, a buoyant spirit, and a great social position.</s> <s sid="63" id="sybil.c5.s63">Lady Marney was universally and extremely popular; and adored by her children, for indeed she was a mother most affectionate and true.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="sybil.c7.p2"><s sid="11" id="sybil.c7.s11">Lord Marney was several years the senior of Charles Egremont, yet still a young man.</s> <s sid="12" id="sybil.c7.s12">He was handsome; there was indeed a general resemblance between the brothers, though the expression of their countenances was entirely different; of the same height and air, and throughout the features a certain family cast; but here the likeness ceased.</s> <s sid="13" id="sybil.c7.s13">The countenance of Lord Marney bespoke the character of his mind; cynical, devoid of sentiment, arrogant, literal, hard.</s> <s sid="14" id="sybil.c7.s14">He had no imagination, had exhausted his slight native feeling, but he was acute, disputatious, and firm even to obstinacy.</s> <s sid="15" id="sybil.c7.s15">Though his early education had been very imperfect, he had subsequently read a good deal, especially in French literature.</s> <s sid="16" id="sybil.c7.s16">He had formed his mind by Helvetius, whose system he deemed irrefutable, and in whom alone he had faith.</s> <s sid="17" id="sybil.c7.s17">Armed with the principles of his great master, he believed he could pass through existence in adamantine armour, and always gave you in the business of life the idea of a man who was conscious you were trying to take him in, and rather respected you for it, but the working of whose cold, unkind, eye defied you.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="sybil.c7.p3" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="sybil.c7.s18">There never had been excessive cordiality between the brothers even in their boyish days, and shortly after Egremont's entrance into life, they had become estranged.</s> <s sid="19" id="sybil.c7.s19">They were to meet now for the first time since Egremont's return from the continent.</s> <s sid="20" id="sybil.c7.s20">Their mother had arranged their reconciliation.</s> <s sid="21" id="sybil.c7.s21">They were to meet as if no misunderstanding had ever existed between them; it was specially stipulated by Lord Marney, that there was to be no <qs/>"scene."<qe/></s> <s sid="22" id="sybil.c7.s22">Apprised of Egremont's impending arrival, Lord Marney was careful to be detained late that day at petty sessions, and entered the room only a few minutes before dinner was announced, where he found Egremont not only with the countess and a young lady who was staying with her, but with additional bail against any ebullition of sentiment in the shape of the Vicar of Marney, and a certain Captain Grouse, who was a kind of aide-de-camp of the earl; killed birds and carved them; played billiards with him, and lost; had indeed every accomplishment that could please woman or ease man; could sing, dance, draw, make artificial flies, break horses, exercise a supervision over stewards and bailiffs, and make every body comfortable by taking everything on his own shoulders.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="sybil.c7.p4"><s sid="23" id="sybil.c7.s23">Lady Marney had received Egremont in a manner which expressed the extreme satisfaction she experienced at finding him once more beneath his brother's roof.</s> <s sid="24" id="sybil.c7.s24">When he arrived indeed, he would have preferred to have been shown at once to his rooms, but a message immediately delivered expressed the wish of his sister-in-law at once to see him.</s> <s sid="25" id="sybil.c7.s25">She received him alone and with great warmth.</s> <s sid="26" id="sybil.c7.s26">She was beautiful, and soft as May; a glowing yet delicate face; rich brown hair, and large blue eyes; not yet a mother, but with something of the dignity of the matron blending with the lingering timidity of the girl.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="sybil.c7.p5"><s sid="27" id="sybil.c7.s27">Egremont was glad to join his sister-in-law again in the drawing-room before dinner.</s> <s sid="28" id="sybil.c7.s28">He seated himself by her side; and in answer to her enquiries was giving her some narrative of his travels; the Vicar who was very low church, was shaking his head at Lady Marney's young friend, who was enlarging on the excellence of Mr Paget's tales; while Captain Grouse, in a very stiff white neck-cloth, very tight pantaloons, to show his very celebrated legs, transparent stockings and polished shoes, was throwing himself into attitudes in the back ground, and with a zeal amounting almost to enthusiasm, teaching Lady Marney's spaniel to beg; when the door opened, and Lord Marney entered, but as if to make security doubly sure, not alone.</s> <s sid="29" id="sybil.c7.s29">He was accompanied by a neighbour and brother magistrate, Sir Vavasour Firebrace, a baronet of the earliest batch, and a gentleman of great family and great estate.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="sybil.c7.p6" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="sybil.c7.s30"><qs/>"Well Charles!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="sybil.c7.p7" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="sybil.c7.s31"><qs/>"How are you George?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="sybil.c7.p8"><s sid="32" id="sybil.c7.s32">And the brothers shook hands.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="sybil.c7.p9"><s sid="33" id="sybil.c7.s33">'Tis the English way; and if they had been inclined to fall into each other's arms, they would not probably have done more.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="sybil.c7.p10" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="sybil.c7.s34">In a few minutes it was announced that dinner was served, and so, secured from a scene, having a fair appetite, and surrounded by dishes that could agreeably satisfy it, a kind of vague fraternal sentiment began to stir the breast of Lord Marney: he really was glad to see his brother again; remembered the days when they rode their poneys and played cricket; his voice softened, his eyes sparkled, and he at length exclaimed, <qs/>"Do you know, old fellow, it makes me quite happy to see you here again.</s> <s sid="35" id="sybil.c7.s35">Suppose we take a glass of wine."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="sybil.c7.p11" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="sybil.c7.s36">The softer heart and more susceptible spirit of Egremont were well calculated to respond to this ebullition of feeling, however slight; and truly it was for many reasons not without considerable emotion, that he found himself once more at Marney.</s> <s sid="37" id="sybil.c7.s37">He sate by the side of his gentle sister-in-law, who seemed pleased by the unwonted cordiality of her husband, and anxious by many kind offices to second every indication of good feeling on his part.</s> <s sid="38" id="sybil.c7.s38">Captain Grouse was extremely assiduous: the vicar was of the deferential breed, agreed with Lady Marney on the importance of infant schools, but recalled his opinion when Lord Marney expressed his imperious hope that no infant schools would ever be found in his neighbourhood.</s> <s sid="39" id="sybil.c7.s39">Sir Vavasour was more than middle aged, comely, very gentlemanlike, but with an air occasionally of absence which hardly agreed with his frank and somewhat hearty idiosyncracy; his clear brow, florid complexion, and blue eye.</s> <s sid="40" id="sybil.c7.s40">But Lord Marney talked a good deal, though chiefly dogmatical or argumentative.</s> <s sid="41" id="sybil.c7.s41">It was rather difficult for him to find a sufficient stock of opposition, but he laid in wait and seized every opening with wonderful alacrity.</s> <s sid="42" id="sybil.c7.s42">Even Captain Grouse could not escape him; if driven to extremity Lord Marney would even question his principles on fly-making.</s> <s sid="43" id="sybil.c7.s43">Captain Grouse gave up, but not too soon; he was well aware that his noble friend's passion for controversy was equal to his love of conquest.</s> <s sid="44" id="sybil.c7.s44">As for Lady Marney, it was evident that with no inconsiderable talents, and with an intelligence richly cultivated, the controversial genius of her husband had completely cowed her conversational charms.</s> <s sid="45" id="sybil.c7.s45">She never advanced a proposition that he did not immediately bristle up, and she could only evade the encounter by a graceful submission.</s> <s sid="46" id="sybil.c7.s46">As for the vicar, a frequent guest, he would fain have taken refuge in silence, but the earl, especially when alone, would what he called <qs/>"draw him out,"<qe/> and the game once unearthed, with so skilled a pack there was but little fear of a bad run.</s> <s sid="47" id="sybil.c7.s47">When all were reduced to silence, Lord Marney relinquishing controversy, assumed the positive.</s> <s sid="48" id="sybil.c7.s48">He eulogized the new poor law, which he declared would be the salvation of the country, provided it was "carried out" in the spirit in which it was developed in the Marney Union; but then he would add that there was no district except their union in which it was properly observed.</s> <s sid="49" id="sybil.c7.s49">He was tremendously fierce against allotments and analysed the system with merciless sarcasm, Indeed he had no inconsiderable acquaintance with the doctrines of the economists, and was rather inclined to carry them into practice in every instance, except that of the landed proprietary, which he clearly proved "stood upon different grounds" to that of any other <qs/>"interest."<qe/></s> <s sid="50" id="sybil.c7.s50">There was nothing he hated so much as a poacher, except a lease; though perhaps in the catalogue of his aversions, we ought to give the preference to his anti-ecclesiastical prejudice: this amounted even to acrimony.</s> <s sid="51" id="sybil.c7.s51">Though there was no man breathing who was possessed with such a strong repugnance to subscriptions of any kind, it delighted Lord Marney to see his name among the contributors to all sectarian institutions.</s> <s sid="52" id="sybil.c7.s52">The vicar of Marney, who had been presented by himself, was his model of a priest: he left every body alone.</s> <s sid="53" id="sybil.c7.s53">Under the influence of Lady Marney, the worthy vicar had once warmed up into some ebullition of very low church zeal; there was some talk of an evening lecture, the schools were to be remodelled, certain tracts were actually distributed.</s> <s sid="54" id="sybil.c7.s54">But Lord Marney soon stopped all this.</s> <s sid="55" id="sybil.c7.s55"><qs/>"No priestcraft at Marney,"<qe/> said this gentle proprietor of abbey lands.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="sybil.c7.p12" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="sybil.c7.s56"><qs/>"I wanted very much to come and canvass for you,"<qe/><sls/> said Lady Marney to Egremont, <sle/><qs/>"but George did not like it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="sybil.c7.p13" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="sybil.c7.s57"><qs/>"The less the family interfered the better,"<qe/><sss/> said Lord Marney; <sse/><qs/>"and for my part, I was very much alarmed when I heard my mother had gone down."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="sybil.c7.p14" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="sybil.c7.s58"><qs/>"Oh! my mother did wonders,"<qe/> said Egremont:</s> <s sid="59" id="sybil.c7.s59"><qs/>"we should have been beat without her.</s> <s sid="60" id="sybil.c7.s60">Indeed, to tell the truth, I quite gave up the thing the moment they started their man.</s> <s sid="61" id="sybil.c7.s61">Before that we were on velvet; but the instant he appeared everything was changed, and I found some of my warmest supporters, members of his committee."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="sybil.c7.p15" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="sybil.c7.s62"><qs/>"You had a formidable opponent, Lord Marney told me,"<qe/> said Sir Vavasour.</s> <s sid="63" id="sybil.c7.s63"><qs/>"Who was he?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="sybil.c7.p17" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="sybil.c7.s66"><qs/>"But they do not care much for free trade in the old borough?"<qe/> said Lord Marney.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="sybil.c7.p18" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="sybil.c7.s67"><qs/>"No, it was a mistake,"<qe/><sss/> said Egremont, <sse/><qs/>"and the cry was changed the moment my opponent was on the ground.</s> <s sid="68" id="sybil.c7.s68">Then all the town was placarded with <alt-qs/>'Vote for McDruggy and our young Queen,'<alt-qe/> as if he had coalesced with her Majesty."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="sybil.c7.p19" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="sybil.c7.s69"><qs/>"My mother must have been in despair,"<qe/> said Lord Marney.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="sybil.c9.p1"><s sid="1" id="sybil.c9.s1">The situation of the rural town of Marney was one of the most delightful easily to be imagined.</s> <s sid="2" id="sybil.c9.s2">In a spreading dale, contiguous to the margin of a clear and lively stream, surrounded by meadows and gardens, and backed by lofty hills, undulating and richly wooded, the traveller on the opposite heights of the dale would often stop to admire the merry prospect, that recalled to him the traditional epithet of his country.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="sybil.c9.p2"><s sid="3" id="sybil.c9.s3">Beautiful illusion!</s> <s sid="4" id="sybil.c9.s4">For behind that laughing landscape, penury and disease fed upon the vitals of a miserable population!</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="sybil.c9.p3"><s sid="5" id="sybil.c9.s5">The contrast between the interior of the town and its external aspect, was as striking as it was full of pain.</s> <s sid="6" id="sybil.c9.s6">With the exception of the dull high street, which had the usual characteristics of a small agricultural market town, some sombre mansions, a dingy inn, and a petty bourse, Marney mainly consisted of a variety of narrow and crowded lanes formed by cottages built of rubble, or unhewn stones without cement, and from age, or badness of the material, looking as if they could scarcely hold together.</s> <s sid="7" id="sybil.c9.s7">The gaping chinks admitted every blast; the leaning chimneys had lost half their original height; the rotten rafters were evidently misplaced; while in many instances the thatch, yawning in some parts to admit the wind and wet, and in all utterly unfit for its original purpose of giving protection from the weather, looked more like the top of a dunghill than a cottage.</s> <s sid="8" id="sybil.c9.s8">Before the doors of these dwellings, and often surrounding them, ran open drains full of animal and vegetable refuse, decomposing into disease, or sometimes in their imperfect course filling foul pits or spreading into stagnant pools, while a concentrated solution of every species of dissolving filth was allowed to soak through and thoroughly impregnate the walls and ground adjoining.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="sybil.c9.p4"><s sid="9" id="sybil.c9.s9">These wretched tenements seldom consisted of more than two rooms, in one of which the whole family, however numerous, were obliged to sleep, without distinction of age, or sex, or suffering.</s> <s sid="10" id="sybil.c9.s10">With the water streaming down the walls, the light distinguished through the roof, with no hearth even in winter, the virtuous mother in the sacred pangs of childbirth, gives forth another victim to our thoughtless civilization; surrounded by three generations whose inevitable presence is more painful than her sufferings in that hour of travail; while the father of her coming child, in another corner of the sordid chamber, lies stricken by that typhus which his contaminating dwelling has breathed into his veins, and for whose next prey is perhaps destined, his new-born child.</s> <s sid="11" id="sybil.c9.s11">These swarming walls had neither windows nor doors sufficient to keep out the weather, or admit the sun or supply the means of ventilation; the humid and putrid roof of thatch exhaling malaria like all other decaying vegetable matter.</s> <s sid="12" id="sybil.c9.s12">The dwelling rooms were neither boarded nor paved; and whether it were that some were situate in low and damp places, occasionally flooded by the river, and usually much below the level of the road; or that the springs, as was often the case, would burst through the mud floor; the ground was at no time better than so much clay, while sometimes you might see little channels cut from the centre under the doorways to carry off the water, the door itself removed from its hinges: a resting place for infancy in its deluged home.</s> <s sid="13" id="sybil.c9.s13">These hovels were in many instances not provided with the commonest conveniences of the rudest police; contiguous to every door might be observed the dung-heap on which every kind of filth was accumulated, for the purpose of being disposed of for manure, so that, when the poor man opened his narrow habitation in the hope of refreshing it with the breeze of summer, he was met with a mixture of gases from reeking dunghills.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="sybil.c9.p5"><s sid="14" id="sybil.c9.s14">This town of Marney was a metropolis of agricultural labour, for the proprietors of the neighbourhood having for the last half century acted on the system of destroying the cottages on their estates, in order to become exempted from the maintenance of the population, the expelled people had flocked to Marney, where, during the war, a manufactory had afforded them some relief, though its wheels had long ceased to disturb the waters of the Mar.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="sybil.c9.p6"><s sid="15" id="sybil.c9.s15">Deprived of this resource, they had again gradually spread themselves over that land which had as it were rejected them; and obtained from its churlish breast a niggardly subsistence.</s> <s sid="16" id="sybil.c9.s16">Their re-entrance into the surrounding parishes was viewed with great suspicion; their renewed settlement opposed by every ingenious contrivance; those who availed themselves of their labour were careful that they should not become dwellers on the soil; and though, from the excessive competition, there were few districts in the kingdom where the rate of wages was more depressed, those who were fortunate enough to obtain the scant remuneration, had, in addition to their toil, to endure each morn and even a weary journey before they could reach the scene of their labour, or return to the squalid hovel which profaned the name of home.</s> <s sid="17" id="sybil.c9.s17">To that home, over which Malaria hovered, and round whose shivering hearth were clustered other guests besides the exhausted family of toil--Fever, in every form, pale Consumption, exhausting Synochus, and trembling Ague,--returned after cultivating the broad fields of merry England the bold British peasant, returned to encounter the worst of diseases with a frame the least qualified to oppose them; a frame that subdued by toil was never sustained by animal food; drenched by the tempest could not change its dripping rags; and was indebted for its scanty fuel to the windfalls of the woods.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="sybil.c9.p7"><s sid="18" id="sybil.c9.s18">The eyes of this unhappy race might have been raised to the solitary spire that sprang up in the midst of them, the bearer of present consolation, the harbinger of future equality; but Holy Church at Marney had forgotten her sacred mission.</s> <s sid="19" id="sybil.c9.s19">We have introduced the reader to the vicar, an orderly man who deemed he did his duty if he preached each week two sermons, and enforced humility on his congregation and gratitude for the blessings of this life.</s> <s sid="20" id="sybil.c9.s20">The high Street and some neighbouring gentry were the staple of his hearers.</s> <s sid="21" id="sybil.c9.s21">Lord and Lady Marney came, attended by Captain Grouse, every Sunday morning with commendable regularity, and were ushered into the invisible interior of a vast pew, that occupied half of the gallery, was lined with crimson damask, and furnished with easy chairs, and, for those who chose them, well-padded stools of prayer.</s> <s sid="22" id="sybil.c9.s22">The people of Marney took refuge in conventicles, which abounded; little plain buildings of pale brick with the names painted on them, of Sion, Bethel, Bethesda: names of a distant land, and the language of a persecuted and ancient race: yet, such is the mysterious power of their divine quality, breathing consolation in the nineteenth century to the harassed forms and the harrowed souls of a Saxon peasantry.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="sybil.c9.p8"><s sid="23" id="sybil.c9.s23">But however devoted to his flock might have been the Vicar of Marney, his exertions for their well being, under any circumstances, must have been mainly limited to spiritual consolation.</s> <s sid="24" id="sybil.c9.s24">Married and a father he received for his labours the small tithes of the parish, which secured to him an income by no means equal to that of a superior banker's clerk, or the cook of a great loanmonger.</s> <s sid="25" id="sybil.c9.s25">The great tithes of Marney, which might he counted by thousands, swelled the vast rental which was drawn from this district by the fortunate earls that bore its name.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="sybil.c23.p1"><s sid="1" id="sybil.c23.s1">The last rays of the sun, contending with clouds of smoke that drifted across the country, partially illumined a peculiar landscape.</s> <s sid="2" id="sybil.c23.s2">Far as the eye could reach, and the region was level, except where a range of limestone hills formed its distant limit, a wilderness of cottages or tenements that were hardly entitled to a higher name, were scattered for many miles over the land; some detached, some connected in little rows, some clustering in groups, yet rarely forming continuous streets, but interspersed with blazing furnaces, heaps of burning coal, and piles of smouldering ironstone; while forges and engine chimneys roared and puffed in all directions, and indicated the frequent presence of the mouth of the mine and the bank of the coal-pit.</s> <s sid="3" id="sybil.c23.s3">Notwithstanding the whole country might be compared to a vast rabbit warren, it was nevertheless intersected with canals crossing each other at various levels, and though the subterranean operations were prosecuted with so much avidity that it was not uncommon to observe whole rows of houses awry, from the shifting and hollow nature of the land, still, intermingled with heaps of mineral refuse or of metallic dross, patches of the surface might here and there be recognised, covered, as if in mockery, with grass and corn, looking very much like those gentlemen's sons that we used to read of in our youth, stolen by the chimneysweeps and giving some intimations of their breeding beneath their grimy livery.</s> <s sid="4" id="sybil.c23.s4">But a tree or a shrub--such an existence was unknown in this dingy rather than dreary region.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="sybil.c23.p2"><s sid="5" id="sybil.c23.s5">It was the twilight hour; the hour at which in southern climes the peasant kneels before the sunset image of the blessed Hebrew maiden; when caravans halt in their long course over vast deserts, and the turbaned traveller bending in the sand, pays his homage to the sacred stone and the sacred city; the hour, not less holy, that announces the cessation of English toil, and sends forth the miner and the collier to breathe the air of earth, and gaze on the light of heaven.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="sybil.c23.p3"><s sid="6" id="sybil.c23.s6">They come forth: the mine delivers its gang and the pit its bondsmen; the forge is silent and the engine is still.</s> <s sid="7" id="sybil.c23.s7">The plain is covered with the swarming multitude: bands of stalwart men, broad-chested and muscular, wet with toil, and black as the children of the tropics; troops of youth--alas! of both sexes,--though neither their raiment nor their language indicates the difference; all are clad in male attire; and oaths that men might shudder at, issue from lips born to breathe words of sweetness.</s> <s sid="8" id="sybil.c23.s8">Yet these are to be--some are--the mothers of England!</s> <s sid="9" id="sybil.c23.s9">But can we wonder at the hideous coarseness of their language when we remember the savage rudeness of their lives?</s> <s sid="10" id="sybil.c23.s10">Naked to the waist, an iron chain fastened to a belt of leather runs between their legs clad in canvas trousers, while on hands and feet an English girl, for twelve, sometimes for sixteen hours a-day, hauls and hurries tubs of coals up subterranean roads, dark, precipitous, and plashy: circumstances that seem to have escaped the notice of the Society for the Abolition of Negro Slavery.</s> <s sid="11" id="sybil.c23.s11">Those worthy gentlemen too appear to have been singularly unconscious of the sufferings of the little Trappers, which was remarkable, as many of them were in their own employ.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="sybil.c26.p1"><s sid="1" id="sybil.c26.s1">Wodgate, or Wogate, as it was called on the map, was a district that in old days had been consecrated to Woden, and which appeared destined through successive ages to retain its heathen character.</s> <s sid="2" id="sybil.c26.s2">At the beginning of the revolutionary war, Wodgate was a sort of squatting district of the great mining region to which it was contiguous, a place where adventurers in the industry which was rapidly developing, settled themselves; for though the great veins of coal and ironstone cropped up, as they phrase it, before they reached this bare and barren land, and it was thus deficient in those mineral and metallic treasures which had enriched its neighbourhood, Wodgate had advantages of its own, and of a kind which touch the fancy of the lawless.</s> <s sid="3" id="sybil.c26.s3">It was land without an owner; no one claimed any manorial right over it; they could build cottages without paying rent.</s> <s sid="4" id="sybil.c26.s4">It was a district recognized by no parish; so there were no tithes, and no meddlesome supervision.</s> <s sid="5" id="sybil.c26.s5">It abounded in fuel which cost nothing, for though the veins were not worth working as a source of mining profit, the soil of Wodgate was similar in its superficial character to that of the country around.</s> <s sid="6" id="sybil.c26.s6">So a population gathered, and rapidly increased, in the ugliest spot in England, to which neither Nature nor art had contributed a single charm; where a tree could not be seen, a flower was unknown, where there was neither belfry nor steeple, nor a single sight or sound that could soften the heart or humanise the mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="sybil.c26.p2"><s sid="7" id="sybil.c26.s7">Whatever may have been the cause, whether, as not unlikely, the original squatters brought with them some traditionary skill, or whether their isolated and unchequered existence concentrated their energies on their craft, the fact is certain, that the inhabitants of Wodgate early acquired a celebrity as skilful workmen.</s> <s sid="8" id="sybil.c26.s8">This reputation so much increased, and in time spread so far, that for more than a quarter of a century, both in their skill and the economy of their labour, they have been unmatched throughout the country.</s> <s sid="9" id="sybil.c26.s9">As manufacturers of ironmongery, they carry the palm from the whole district; as founders of brass and workers of steel, they fear none; while as nailers and locksmiths, their fame has spread even to the European markets, whither their most skilful workmen have frequently been invited.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="sybil.c26.p3"><s sid="10" id="sybil.c26.s10">Invited in vain!</s> <s sid="11" id="sybil.c26.s11">No wages can tempt the Wodgate man from his native home, that squatters' seat which soon assumed the form of a large village, and then in turn soon expanded into a town, and at the present moment numbers its population by swarming thousands, lodged in the most miserable tenements in the most hideous burgh in the ugliest country in the world.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="sybil.c26.p4"><s sid="12" id="sybil.c26.s12">But it has its enduring spell.</s> <s sid="13" id="sybil.c26.s13">Notwithstanding the spread of its civic prosperity, it has lost none of the characteristics of its original society; on the contrary it has zealously preserved them.</s> <s sid="14" id="sybil.c26.s14">There are no landlords, head-lessees, main- masters, or butties in Wodgate.</s> <s sid="15" id="sybil.c26.s15">No church there has yet raised its spire; and as if the jealous spirit of Woden still haunted his ancient temple, even the conventicle scarcely dares show its humble front in some obscure corner.</s> <s sid="16" id="sybil.c26.s16">There is no municipality, no magistrate, no local acts, no vestries, no schools of any kind.</s> <s sid="17" id="sybil.c26.s17">The streets are never cleaned; every man lights his own house; nor does any one know anything except his business.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="sybil.c26.p5"><s sid="18" id="sybil.c26.s18">More than this, at Wodgate a factory or large establishment of any kind is unknown.</s> <s sid="19" id="sybil.c26.s19">Here Labour reigns supreme.</s> <s sid="20" id="sybil.c26.s20">Its division indeed is favoured by their manners, but the interference or influence of mere capital is instantly resisted.</s> <s sid="21" id="sybil.c26.s21">The business of Wodgate is carried on by master workmen in their own houses, each of whom possesses an unlimited number of what they call apprentices, by whom their affairs are principally conducted, and whom they treat as the Mamlouks treated the Egyptians.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="sybil.c38.p2"><s sid="5" id="sybil.c38.s5">The Abbey of Westminster rises amid the strife of factions.</s> <s sid="6" id="sybil.c38.s6">Around its consecrated precinct some of the boldest and some of the worst deeds have been achieved or perpetrated: sacrilege, rapine, murder, and treason.</s> <s sid="7" id="sybil.c38.s7">Here robbery has been practised on the greatest scale known in modern ages: here ten thousand manors belonging to the order of the Templars, without any proof, scarcely with a pretext, were forfeited in one day and divided among the monarch and his chief nobles; here the great estate of the church, which, whatever its articles of faith, belonged and still belongs to the people, was seized at various times, under various pretences, by an assembly that continually changed the religion of their country and their own by a parliamentary majority, but which never refunded the booty.</s> <s sid="8" id="sybil.c38.s8">Here too was brought forth that monstrous conception which even patrician Rome in its most ruthless period never equalled--the mortgaging of the industry of the country to enrich and to protect property; an act which is now bringing its retributive consequences in a degraded and alienated population.</s> <s sid="9" id="sybil.c38.s9">Here too have the innocent been impeached and hunted to death; and a virtuous and able monarch martyred, because, among other benefits projected for his people, he was of opinion that it was more for their advantage that the economic service of the state should be supplied by direct taxation levied by an individual known to all, than by indirect taxation, raised by an irresponsible and fluctuating assembly.</s> <s sid="10" id="sybil.c38.s10">But thanks to parliamentary patriotism, the people of England were saved from ship-money, which money the wealthy paid, and only got in its stead the customs and excise, which the poor mainly supply.</s> <s sid="11" id="sybil.c38.s11">Rightly was King Charles surnamed the Martyr; for he was the holocaust of direct taxation.</s> <s sid="12" id="sybil.c38.s12">Never yet did man lay down his heroic life for so great a cause: the cause of the Church and the cause of the Poor.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="sybil.c38.p3"><s sid="13" id="sybil.c38.s13">Even now in the quiet times in which we live, when public robbery is out of fashion and takes the milder title of a commission of inquiry, and when there is no treason except voting against a Minister, who, though he may have changed all the policy which you have been elected to support, expects your vote and confidence all the same; even in this age of mean passions and petty risks, it is something to step aside from Palace Yard and instead of listening to a dull debate, where the facts are only a repetition of the blue books you have already read, and the fancy an ingenious appeal to the recrimination of Hansard, to enter the old abbey and listen to an anthem!</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="sybil.c38.p4"><s sid="14" id="sybil.c38.s14">This was a favourite habit of Egremont, and though the mean discipline and sordid arrangements of the ecclesiastical body to which the guardianship of the beautiful edifice is intrusted, have certainly done all that could injure and impair the holy genius of the place, it still was a habit often full of charm and consolation.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="sybil.c38.p5"><s sid="15" id="sybil.c38.s15">There is not perhaps another metropolitan population in the world that would tolerate such conduct as is pursued to "that great lubber, the public" by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, and submit in silence to be shut out from the only building in the two cities which is worthy of the name of a cathedral.</s> <s sid="16" id="sybil.c38.s16">But the British public will bear anything; they are so busy in speculating in railroad shares.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="sybil.c38.p6"><s sid="17" id="sybil.c38.s17">When Egremont had entered on his first visit to the Abbey by the south transept, and beheld the boards and the spikes with which he seemed to be environed as if the Abbey were in a state of siege; iron gates shutting him out from the solemn nave and the shadowy aisles; scarcely a glimpse to be caught of a single window; while on a dirty form, some noisy vergers sate like ticket-porters or babbled like tapsters at their ease,--the visions of abbatial perfection in which he had early and often indulged among the ruins of Marney rose on his outraged sense, and he was then about hastily to retire from the scene he had so long purposed to visit, when suddenly the organ burst forth, a celestial symphony floated in the lofty roof, and voices of plaintive melody blended with the swelling sounds.</s> <s sid="18" id="sybil.c38.s18">He was fixed to the spot.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="sybil.c38.p7"><s sid="19" id="sybil.c38.s19">Perhaps it was some similar feeling that influenced another individual on the day after the visit of the deputation to Egremont.</s> <s sid="20" id="sybil.c38.s20">The sun, though in his summer heaven he had still a long course, had passed his meridian by many hours, the service was performing in the choir, and a few persons entering by the door into that part of the Abbey Church which is so well known by the name of Poet's Corner, proceeded through the unseemly stockade which the chapter have erected, and took their seats.</s> <s sid="21" id="sybil.c38.s21">One only, a female, declined to pass, notwithstanding the officious admonitions of the vergers that she had better move on, but approaching the iron grating that shut her out from the body of the church, looked wistfully down the long dim perspective of the beautiful southern aisle.</s> <s sid="22" id="sybil.c38.s22">And thus motionless she remained in contemplation, or it might be prayer, while the solemn peals of the organ and the sweet voices of the choir enjoyed that holy liberty for which she sighed, and seemed to wander at their will in every sacred recess and consecrated corner.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="sybil.c38.p8" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="sybil.c38.s23">The sounds--those mystical and thrilling sounds that at once elevate the soul and touch the heart--ceased, the chaunting of the service recommenced; the motionless form moved; and as she moved Egremont came forth from the choir, and his eye was at once caught by the symmetry of her shape and the picturesque position which she gracefully occupied; still gazing through that grate, while the light pouring through the western window, suffused the body of the church with a soft radiance, just touching the head of the unknown with a kind of halo.</s> <s sid="24" id="sybil.c38.s24">Egremont approached the transept door with a lingering pace, so that the stranger, who he observed was preparing to leave the church, might overtake him.</s> <s sid="25" id="sybil.c38.s25">As he reached the door, anxious to assure himself that he was not mistaken, he turned round and his eye at once caught the face of Sybil.</s> <s sid="26" id="sybil.c38.s26">He started, he trembled; she was not two yards distant, she evidently recognised him; he held open the swinging postern of the Abbey that she might pass, which she did and then stopped on the outside, and said <qs/>"Mr Franklin!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="sybil.c38.p9"><s sid="27" id="sybil.c38.s27">It was therefore clear that her father had not thought fit, or had not yet had an opportunity, to communicate to Sybil the interview of yesterday.</s> <s sid="28" id="sybil.c38.s28">Egremont was still Mr Franklin.</s> <s sid="29" id="sybil.c38.s29">This was perplexing.</s> <s sid="30" id="sybil.c38.s30">Egremont would like to have been saved the pain and awkwardness of the avowal, yet it must be made, though not with unnecessary crudeness.</s> <s sid="31" id="sybil.c38.s31">And so at present he only expressed his delight, the unexpected delight he experienced at their meeting.</s> <s sid="32" id="sybil.c38.s32">And then he walked on by her side.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="sybil.c38.p10" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="sybil.c38.s33"><qs/>"Indeed,"<qe/><sss/> said Sybil, <sse/><qs/>"I can easily imagine you must have been surprised at seeing me in this great city.</s> <s sid="34" id="sybil.c38.s34">But many things, strange and unforeseen, have happened to us since you were at Mowedale.</s> <s sid="35" id="sybil.c38.s35">You know, of course you with your pursuits must know, that the People have at length resolved to summon their own parliament in Westminster.</s> <s sid="36" id="sybil.c38.s36">The people of Mowbray had to send up two delegates to the Convention, and they chose my father for one of them.</s> <s sid="37" id="sybil.c38.s37">For so great is their confidence in him none other would content them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="sybil.c38.p13"><s sid="47" id="sybil.c38.s47">Egremont mused: he must disclose all, yet how embarrassing to enter into such explanations in a public thoroughfare!</s> <s sid="48" id="sybil.c38.s48">Should he bid her after a-while farewell, and then make his confession in writing?</s> <s sid="49" id="sybil.c38.s49">Should he at once accompany her home, and there offer his perplexing explanations?</s> <s sid="50" id="sybil.c38.s50">Or should he acknowledge his interview of yesterday with Gerard, and then leave the rest to the natural consequences of that acknowledgment when Sybil met her father!</s> <s sid="51" id="sybil.c38.s51">Thus pondering, Egremont and Sybil, quitting the court of the Abbey, entered Abingdon Street.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="sybil.c45.p2"><s sid="3" id="sybil.c45.s3">More than twenty years had elapsed since the question had been mooted; and though the discussion had left upon Lord de Mowbray an impression from which at times he had never entirely recovered, still circumstances had occurred since the last proceedings which gave him a moral if not a legal conviction that he should be disturbed no more.</s> <s sid="4" id="sybil.c45.s4">And these were the circumstances:</s> <s sid="5" id="sybil.c45.s5">Lord de Mowbray after the death of the father of Walter Gerard had found himself in communication with the agent who had developed and pursued the claim for the yeoman, and had purchased for a good round sum the documents on which that claim was founded, and by which apparently that claim could only be sustained.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="sybil.c45.p3"><s sid="6" id="sybil.c45.s6">The vendor of these muniments was Baptist Hatton, and the sum which he obtained for them, by allowing him to settle in the metropolis, pursue his studies, purchase his library and collections, and otherwise give himself that fair field which brains without capital can seldom command, was in fact the foundation of his fortune.</s> <s sid="7" id="sybil.c45.s7">Many years afterwards Lord de Mowbray had recognised Hatton in the prosperous parliamentary agent who often appeared at the bar of the House of Lords and before committees of privileges, and who gradually obtained an unrivalled reputation and employment in peerage cases.</s> <s sid="8" id="sybil.c45.s8">Lord de Mowbray renewed his acquaintance with a man who was successful; bowed to Hatton whenever they met; and finally consulted him respecting the barony of Valence which had been in the old Fitz-Warene and Mowbray families and to which it was thought the present earl might prefer some hocus-pocus claim through his deceased mother; so that however recent was his date as an English earl, he might figure on the roll as a Plantagenet baron, which in the course of another century would complete the grand mystification of high nobility.</s> <s sid="9" id="sybil.c45.s9">The death of his son dexterously christened Valence had a little damped his ardour in this respect; but still there was a sufficiently intimate connection kept up between him and Hatton; so that before he placed the letter he had received in the hands of his lawyers he thought it desirable to consult his ancient ally.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="sybil.c45.p4"><s sid="10" id="sybil.c45.s10">This was the reason that Lord de Mowbray was at the present moment seated in the same chair in the same library as was a few days back that worthy baronet, Sir Vavasour Firebrace.</s> <s sid="11" id="sybil.c45.s11">Mr Hatton was at the same table similarly employed; his Persian cat on his right hand, and his choice spaniels reposing on their cushions at his feet.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="sybil.c45.p5"><s sid="12" id="sybil.c45.s12">Mr Hatton held forward his hand to receive the letter of which Lord de Mowbray had been speaking to him, and which he read with great attention, weighing as it were each word.</s> <s sid="13" id="sybil.c45.s13">Singular! as the letter had been written by himself, and the firm who signed it were only his instruments, obeying the spring of the master hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="sybil.c46.p1"><s sid="1" id="sybil.c46.s1">During the week of political agitation which terminated with the inglorious catastrophe of the Bedchamber plot, Sybil remained tranquil, and would have been scarcely conscious of what was disturbing so many right honourable hearts, had it not been for the incidental notice of their transactions by her father and his friends.</s> <s sid="2" id="sybil.c46.s2">To the chartists indeed the factious embroilment at first was of no great moment, except as the breaking up and formation of cabinets might delay the presentation of the National Petition.</s> <s sid="3" id="sybil.c46.s3">They had long ceased to distinguish between the two parties who then and now contend for power.</s> <s sid="4" id="sybil.c46.s4">And they were tight.</s> <s sid="5" id="sybil.c46.s5">Between the noble lord who goes out and the right honourable gentleman who comes in, where is the distinctive principle?</s> <s sid="6" id="sybil.c46.s6">A shadowy difference may be simulated in opposition, to serve a cry and stimulate the hustings: but the mask is not even worn in Downing Street: and the conscientious conservative seeks in the pigeon-holes of a whig bureau for the measures against which for ten years he has been sanctioning by the speaking silence of an approving nod, a general wail of frenzied alarm.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="sybil.c46.p2"><s sid="7" id="sybil.c46.s7">Once it was otherwise; once the people recognised a party in the state whose principles identified them with the rights and privileges of the multitude: but when they found the parochial constitution of the country sacrificed without a struggle, and a rude assault made on all local influences in order to establish a severely organised centralisation, a blow was given to the influence of the priest and of the gentleman, the ancient champions of the people against arbitrary courts and rapacious parliaments, from which they will find that it requires no ordinary courage and wisdom to recover.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="sybil.c46.p3"><s sid="8" id="sybil.c46.s8">The unexpected termination of the events of May, 1839, in the re-establishment in power of a party confessedly too weak to carry on the parliamentary government of the country, was viewed however by the chartists in a very different spirit to that with which they had witnessed the outbreak of these transactions.</s> <s sid="9" id="sybil.c46.s9">It had unquestionably a tendency to animate their efforts, and imparted a bolder tone to their future plans and movements.</s> <s sid="10" id="sybil.c46.s10">They were encouraged to try a fall with a feeble administration.</s> <s sid="11" id="sybil.c46.s11">Gerard from this moment became engrossed in affairs; his correspondence greatly increased; and he was so much occupied that Sybil saw daily less and less of her father.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="sybil.c46.p4"><s sid="12" id="sybil.c46.s12">It was on the morning after the day that Hatton had made his first and unlooked-for visit in Smith's Square, some of the delegates who had caught the rumour of the resignation of the whigs had called early on Gerard, and he had soon after left the house in their company; and Sybil was alone.</s> <s sid="13" id="sybil.c46.s13">The strange incidents of the preceding day were revolving in her mind, as her eye wandered vaguely over her book.</s> <s sid="14" id="sybil.c46.s14">The presence of that Hatton who had so often and in such different scenes occupied their conversation; the re-appearance of that stranger, whose unexpected entrance into their little world had eighteen months ago so often lent interest and pleasure to their life-- these were materials for pensive sentiment.</s> <s sid="15" id="sybil.c46.s15">Mr Franklin had left some gracious memories with Sybil; the natural legacy of one so refined, intelligent, and gentle, whose temper seemed never ruffled, and who evidently so sincerely relished their society.</s> <s sid="16" id="sybil.c46.s16">Mowedale rose before her in all the golden beauty of its autumnal hour; their wild rambles and hearty greetings and earnest converse, when her father returned from his daily duties and his eye kindled with pleasure as the accustomed knock announced the arrival of his almost daily companion.</s> <s sid="17" id="sybil.c46.s17">In spite of the excitement of the passing moment, its high hopes and glorious aspirations, and visions perchance of greatness and of power, the eye of Sybil was dimmed with emotion as she recalled that innocent and tranquil dream.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="sybil.c46.p5"><s sid="18" id="sybil.c46.s18">Her father had heard from Franklin after his departure more than once; but his letters, though abounding in frank expressions of deep interest in the welfare of Gerard and his daughter, were in some degree constrained: a kind of reserve seemed to envelope him; they never learnt anything of his life and duties: he seemed sometimes as it were meditating a departure from his country.</s> <s sid="19" id="sybil.c46.s19">There was undoubtedly about him something mysterious and unsatisfactory.</s> <s sid="20" id="sybil.c46.s20">Morley was of opinion that he was a spy; Gerard, less suspicious, ultimately concluded that he was harassed by his creditors, and when at Mowedale was probably hiding from them.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="sybil.c47.p32" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="sybil.c47.s55"><qs/>"Well, that is sheer radicalism,"<qe/> said the Warwickshire peer; pretending that the People can be better off than they are, is radicalism and nothing else."</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="sybil.c47.p40"><s sid="67" id="sybil.c47.s67">The riots of Birmingham occurred two months after the events that closed our last volume.</s> <s sid="68" id="sybil.c47.s68">That period, as far as the obvious movements of the chartists were concerned, had been passed in preparations for the presentation and discussion of the National Petition, which the parliamentary embroilments of the spring of that year had hitherto procrastinated and prevented.</s> <s sid="69" id="sybil.c47.s69">The petition was ultimately carried down to Westminster on a triumphal car accompanied by all the delegates of the Convention in solemn procession.</s> <s sid="70" id="sybil.c47.s70">It was necessary to construct a machine in order to introduce the huge bulk of parchment signed by a million and a half of persons, into the House of Commons, and thus supported, its vast form remained on the floor of the House during the discussion.</s> <s sid="71" id="sybil.c47.s71">The House after a debate which was not deemed by the people commensurate with the importance of the occasion, decided on rejecting the prayer of the Petition, and from that moment the party in the Convention who advocated a recourse to physical force in order to obtain their purpose, was in the ascendant.</s> <s sid="72" id="sybil.c47.s72">The National Petition and the belief that although its objects would not at present be obtained, still that a solemn and prolonged debate on its prayer would at least hold out to the working classes the hope that their rights might from that date rank among the acknowledged subjects of parliamentary discussion and ultimately by the force of discussion be recognized, as other rights of other portions of the people once equally disputed, had been the means by which the party in the Convention who upheld on all occasions the supremacy of moral power had been able to curb the energetic and reckless minority, who derided from the first all other methods but terror and violence as effective of their end.</s> <s sid="73" id="sybil.c47.s73">The hopes of all, the vanity of many, were frustrated and shocked by finding that the exertions and expenditure of long months were not only fruitless, but had not even attracted as numerous an assembly or excited as much interest, as an ordinary party struggle on some petty point of factitious interest forgotten as soon as fought.</s> <s sid="74" id="sybil.c47.s74">The attention of the working classes was especially called by their leaders to the contrast between the interest occasioned by the endangered constitution of Jamaica, a petty and exhausted colony, and the claims for the same constitutional rights by the working millions of England.</s> <s sid="75" id="sybil.c47.s75">In the first instance, not a member was absent from his place; men were brought indeed from distant capitals to participate in the struggle and to decide it; the debate lasted for days, almost for weeks; not a public man of light and leading in the country withheld the expression of his opinion; the fate of governments was involved in it; cabinets were overthrown and reconstructed in the throes and tumult of the strife, and for the first time for a long period the Sovereign personally interposed in public transactions with a significance of character, which made the working classes almost believe that the privileged had at last found a master, and the unfranchished regained their natural chief.</s> <s sid="76" id="sybil.c47.s76">The mean position which the Saxon multitude occupied as distinguished from the Jamaica planters sunk deep into their hearts.</s> <s sid="77" id="sybil.c47.s77">From that moment all hope of relief from the demonstration of a high moral conduct in the millions, and the exhibition of that well-regulated order of public life which would intimate their fitness for the possession and fulfilment of public rights, vanished.</s> <s sid="78" id="sybil.c47.s78">The party of violence, a small minority as is usually the case, but consisting of men of determined character, triumphed; and the outbreak at Birmingham was the first consequence of those reckless councils that were destined in the course of the ensuing years to inflict on the working classes of this country so much suffering and disaster.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="sybil.c47.p41"><s sid="79" id="sybil.c47.s79">It was about this time, a balmy morning of July, that Sybil, tempted by the soft sunshine, and a longing for the sight of flowers and turf and the spread of winding waters, went forth from her gloomy domicile to those beautiful gardens that bloom in that once melancholy region of marsh, celebrated in old days only for its Dutch canal and its Chinese bridge, and now not unworthy of the royal park that incloses them..</s> <s sid="80" id="sybil.c47.s80">Except here and there a pretty nursery-maid with her interesting charge; some beautiful child with nodding plume, immense bow, and gorgeous sash; the gardens were vacant.</s> <s sid="81" id="sybil.c47.s81">Indeed it was only at this early hour, that Sybil found from experience, that it was agreeable in London for a woman unaccompanied to venture abroad.</s> <s sid="82" id="sybil.c47.s82">There is no European city where our fair sisters are so little independent as in our metropolis; to our shame.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="sybil.c47.p42"><s sid="83" id="sybil.c47.s83">Something of the renovating influence of a beautiful nature was needed by the daughter of Gerard.</s> <s sid="84" id="sybil.c47.s84">She was at this moment anxious and dispirited.</s> <s sid="85" id="sybil.c47.s85">The outbreak at Birmingham, the conviction that such proceedings must ultimately prove fatal to the cause to which she was devoted, the dark apprehension that her father was in some manner implicated in this movement, that had commenced with so much public disaster, and which menaced consequences still more awful, all these events, and fears, and sad forebodings, acted with immense influence on a temperament which, though gifted with even a sublime courage, was singularly sensitive.</s> <s sid="86" id="sybil.c47.s86">The quick and teeming imagination of Sybil conjured up a thousand fears which were in some degree unfounded, in a great degree exaggerated, but this is the inevitable lot of the creative mind practising on the inexperienced.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="sybil.c47.p43" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="sybil.c47.s87">The shock too had been sudden.</s> <s sid="88" id="sybil.c47.s88">The two months that had elapsed since she had parted, as she supposed for ever, from Egremont, while they had not less abounded than the preceding time in that pleasing public excitement which her father's career, in her estimation alike useful, honourable, and distinguished, occasioned her, had been fruitful in some sources of satisfaction of a softer and more domestic character.</s> <s sid="89" id="sybil.c47.s89">The acquaintance of Hatton, of whom they saw a great deal, had very much contributed to the increased amenity of her life.</s> <s sid="90" id="sybil.c47.s90">He was a most agreeable, instructive, and obliging companion; who seemed peculiarly to possess the art of making life pleasant by the adroit management of unobtrusive resources.</s> <s sid="91" id="sybil.c47.s91">He lent Sybil books; and all that he recommended to her notice, were of a kind that harmonized with her sentiment and taste.</s> <s sid="92" id="sybil.c47.s92">He furnished her from his library with splendid works of art, illustrative of those periods of our history and those choice and costly edifices which were associated with her fondest thought and fancy.</s> <s sid="93" id="sybil.c47.s93">He placed in her room the best periodical literature of the day, which for her was a new world; he furnished her with newspapers whose columns of discussion taught her, that the opinions she had embraced were not unquestioned: as she had never seen a journal in her life before, except a stray number of the <qs/>"Mowbray Phalanx,"<qe/> or the metropolitan publication which was devoted to the cause of the National Convention, and reported her father's speeches, the effect of this reading on her intelligence was, to say the least, suggestive.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="sybil.c47.p44"><s sid="94" id="sybil.c47.s94">Many a morning too when Gerard was disengaged, Hatton would propose that they should show Sybil something of the splendour or the rarities of the metropolis; its public buildings, museums, and galleries of art.</s> <s sid="95" id="sybil.c47.s95">Sybil, though uninstructed in painting, had that native taste which requires only observation to arrive at true results.</s> <s sid="96" id="sybil.c47.s96">She was much interested with all she saw and all that occurred, and her gratification was heightened by the society of an individual who not only sympathised with all she felt, but who, if she made an inquiry, was ever ready with an instructive reply.</s> <s sid="97" id="sybil.c47.s97">Hatton poured forth the taste and treasures of a well-stored and refined intelligence.</s> <s sid="98" id="sybil.c47.s98">And then too, always easy, bland, and considerate; and though with luxuries and conveniences at his command, to participate in which, under any other circumstances, might have been embarrassing to his companions, with so much tact, that either by an allusion to early days, happy days when he owed so much to Gerard's father, or some other mode equally felicitous, he contrived completely to maintain among them the spirit of social equality.</s> <s sid="99" id="sybil.c47.s99">In the evening, Hatton generally looked in when Gerard was at home, and on Sundays they were always together.</s> <s sid="100" id="sybil.c47.s100">Their common faith was a bond of union which led them to the same altar, and on that day Hatton had obtained their promise always to dine with him.</s> <s sid="101" id="sybil.c47.s101">He was careful to ascertain each holy day at what chapel the music was most exquisite, that the most passionate taste of Sybil might be gratified.</s> <s sid="102" id="sybil.c47.s102">Indeed, during this residence in London, the opportunity it afforded of making her acquainted with some of the great masters of the human voice was perhaps to Sybil a source of pleasure not the least important.</s> <s sid="103" id="sybil.c47.s103">For though it was not deemed consistent with the future discipline which she contemplated to enter a theatre, there were yet occasions which permitted her, under every advantage, to listen to the performance of the master-pieces of sacred melody.</s> <s sid="104" id="sybil.c47.s104">Alone, with Hatton and her father, she often poured forth those tones of celestial sweetness and etherial power that had melted the soul of Egremont amid the ruins of Marney Abbey.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="sybil.c52.p2"><s sid="6" id="sybil.c52.s6">The long summer twilight was just expiring, the pale shadows of the moon were just stealing on; the gas was beginning to glare in the shops of tripe and bacon, and the paper lanthorns to adorn the stall and the stand.</s> <s sid="7" id="sybil.c52.s7">They crossed a broad street which seemed the metropolis of the district; it flamed with gin-palaces; a multitude were sauntering in the mild though tainted air; bargaining, blaspheming, drinking, wrangling: and varying their business and their potations, their fierce strife and their impious irreverence, with flashes of rich humour, gleams of native wit, and racy phrases of idiomatic slang.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="sybil.c52.p3"><s sid="8" id="sybil.c52.s8">Absorbed in her great mission Sybil was almost insensible to the scenes through which she passed, and her innocence was thus spared many a sight and sound that might have startled her vision or alarmed her ear.</s> <s sid="9" id="sybil.c52.s9">They could not now he very distant from the spot; they were crossing this broad way, and then were about to enter another series of small obscure dingy streets, when the cab-driver giving a flank to his steed to stimulate it to a last effort, the horse sprang forward, and the wheel of the cab came off.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="sybil.c52.p4"><s sid="10" id="sybil.c52.s10">Sybil extricated herself from the vehicle unhurt; a group immediately formed round the cab, a knot of young thieves, almost young enough for infant schools, a dustman, a woman nearly naked and very drunk, and two unshorn ruffians with brutality stamped on every feature, with pipes in their mouths, and their hands in their pockets.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="sybil.c52.p23" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="sybil.c52.s49"><qs/>"This cannot be the house,"<qe/> exclaimed Sybil starting back, overwhelmed with shame and terror.</s> <s sid="50" id="sybil.c52.s50"><qs/>"O! holy Virgin aid me!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="sybil.c69.p2" type="speech"><s sid="2" id="sybil.c69.s2">Kind as was the reception accorded to Sybil by Lady de Mowbray and her daughter on her arrival, the remembrance of the perilous position of her father had totally disqualified her from responding to their advances.</s> <s sid="3" id="sybil.c69.s3">Acquainted with the cause of her anxiety and depression and sympathising with womanly softness with her distress, nothing could be more considerate than their behaviour.</s> <s sid="4" id="sybil.c69.s4">It touched Sybil much, and she regretted the harsh thoughts that irresistible circumstances had forced her to cherish respecting persons, who, now that she saw them in their domestic and unaffected hour, had apparently many qualities to conciliate and to charm.</s> <s sid="5" id="sybil.c69.s5">When the good news arrived of her father's safety, and safety achieved in a manner so flattering to a daughter's pride, it came upon a heart predisposed to warmth and kindness and all her feelings opened.</s> <s sid="6" id="sybil.c69.s6">The tears stood in her beautiful eyes, and they were tears not only of tenderness but gratitude.</s> <s sid="7" id="sybil.c69.s7">Fortunately Lord de Mowbray was at the moment absent, and as the question of the controverted inheritance was a secret to every member of the family except himself, the name of Gerard excited no invidious sensation in the circle.</s> <s sid="8" id="sybil.c69.s8">Sybil was willing to please and to be pleased: every one was captivated by her beauty, her grace, her picturesque expression and sweet simplicity.</s> <s sid="9" id="sybil.c69.s9">Lady de Mowbray serenely smiled and frequently when unobserved viewed her through her eyeglass.</s> <s sid="10" id="sybil.c69.s10">Lady Joan, much softened by marriage, would show her the castle; Lady Maud was in ecstasies with all that Sybil said or did: while Mr Mountchesney who had thought of little else but Sybil ever since Lady Maud's report of her seraphic singing, and who had not let four-and-twenty hours go by without discovering, with all the practised art of St James', the name and residence of the unknown fair, flattered himself he was making great play when Sybil, moved by his great kindness, distinguished him by frequent notice.</s> <s sid="11" id="sybil.c69.s11">They had viewed the castle, they were in the music-room, Sybil had been prevailed upon, though with reluctance, to sing.</s> <s sid="12" id="sybil.c69.s12">Some Spanish church music which she found there called forth all her powers: all was happiness, delight, rapture, Lady Maud in a frenzy of friendship, Mr Mountchesney convinced that the country in August might be delightful, and Lady Joan almost gay because Alfred was pleased.</s> <s sid="13" id="sybil.c69.s13">Lady de Mowbray had been left in her boudoir with the <qs/>"Morning Post."<qe/></s> <s sid="14" id="sybil.c69.s14">Sybil had just finished a ravishing air, there was a murmur of luncheon--when suddenly Harold, who had persisted in following his mistress and whom Mr Mountchesney had gallantly introduced into the music-room, rose and coming forward from the corner in which he reposed, barked violently.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="sybil.c69.p3" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="sybil.c69.s15"><qs/>"How now!"<qe/> said Mr Mountchesney.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="sybil.c69.p4" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="sybil.c69.s16"><qs/>"Harold!"<qe/> said Sybil in a tone of remonstrance and surprise.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="sybil.c69.p5"><s sid="17" id="sybil.c69.s17">But the dog not only continued to bark but even howled.</s> <s sid="18" id="sybil.c69.s18">At this moment the groom of the chambers entered the room abruptly and with a face of mystery said that he wished to speak with Mr Mountchesney.</s> <s sid="19" id="sybil.c69.s19">That gentleman immediately withdrew.</s> <s sid="20" id="sybil.c69.s20">He was absent some little time, the dog very agitated; Lady Joan becoming disquieted, when he returned.</s> <s sid="21" id="sybil.c69.s21">His changed air struck the vigilant eye of his wife.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="sybil.c69.p6" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="sybil.c69.s22"><qs/>"What has happened Alfred?"<qe/> she said.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="sybil.c69.p7" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="sybil.c69.s23"><qs/>"Oh! don't be alarmed,"<qe/> he replied with an obvious affectation of ease.</s> <s sid="24" id="sybil.c69.s24"><qs/>"There are some troublesome people in the park; stragglers I suppose from the rioters.</s> <s sid="25" id="sybil.c69.s25">The gate-keeper ought not to have let them pass.</s> <s sid="26" id="sybil.c69.s26">I have given directions to Bentley what to do, if they come to the castle."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="sybil.c69.p8" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="sybil.c69.s27"><qs/>"Let us go to mama,"<qe/> said Lady Joan.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="sybil.c69.p9" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="sybil.c69.s28">And they were all about leaving the music-room, when a servant came running in and called out <qs/>"Mr Bentley told me to say, sir, they are in sight."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="sybil.c69.p10" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="sybil.c69.s29"><qs/>"Very well,"<qe/> said Mr Mountchesney in a calm tone but changing colour.</s> <s sid="30" id="sybil.c69.s30"><qs/>"You had better go to your mama, Joan, and take Maud and our friend with you.</s> <s sid="31" id="sybil.c69.s31">I will stay below for a while,"<qe/> and notwithstanding the remonstrances of his wife, Mr Mountchesney went to the hall.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="sybil.c69.p11" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="sybil.c69.s32"><qs/>"I don't know what to do, sir,"<qe/> said the house steward.</s> <s sid="33" id="sybil.c69.s33"><qs/>"They are a very strong party."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="sybil.c69.p12" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="sybil.c69.s34"><qs/>"Close all the windows, lock and bar all the doors,"<qe/> said Mr Mountchesney.</s> <s sid="35" id="sybil.c69.s35"><qs/>"I am frightened,"<qe/><sss/> he continued, <sse/><qs/>"about your lord.</s> <s sid="36" id="sybil.c69.s36">I fear he may fall in with these people."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="sybil.c69.p13" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="sybil.c69.s37"><qs/>"My lord is at Mowbray,"<qe/> said Mr Bentley.</s> <s sid="38" id="sybil.c69.s38"><qs/>"He must have heard of this mob there."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="sybil.c69.p14"><s sid="39" id="sybil.c69.s39">And now emerging from the plantations and entering on the lawns, the force and description of the invading party were easier to distinguish.</s> <s sid="40" id="sybil.c69.s40">They were numerous, though consisting of only a section of the original expedition, for Gerard had collected a great portion of the Mowbray men, and they preferred being under his command to following a stranger whom they did not much like on a somewhat licentious adventure of which their natural leader disapproved.</s> <s sid="41" id="sybil.c69.s41">The invading section therefore were principally composed of Hell-cats, though singular enough Morley of all men in the world accompanied them, attended by Devilsdust, Dandy Mick, and others of that youthful class of which these last were the idols and heroes.</s> <s sid="42" id="sybil.c69.s42">There were perhaps eighteen hundred or two thousand persons armed with bars and bludgeons, in general a grimy crew, whose dress and appearance revealed the kind of labour to which they were accustomed.</s> <s sid="43" id="sybil.c69.s43">The difference between them and the minority of Mowbray operatives was instantly recognizable.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="sybil.c69.p15" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="sybil.c69.s44">When they perceived the castle this dreadful band gave a ferocious shout.</s> <s sid="45" id="sybil.c69.s45">Lady de Mowbray showed blood; she was composed and courageous.</s> <s sid="46" id="sybil.c69.s46">She observed the mob from the window, and re-assuring her daughters and Sybil she said she would go down and speak to them.</s> <s sid="47" id="sybil.c69.s47">She was on the point of leaving the room with this object when Mr Mountchesney entered and hearing her purpose, dissuaded her from attempting it.</s> <s sid="48" id="sybil.c69.s48"><qs/>"Leave all to me,"<qe/><sss/> he said; <sse/><qs/>"and make yourselves quite easy; they will go away, I am certain they will go away,"<qe/> and he again quitted them.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="sybil.c69.p16"><s sid="49" id="sybil.c69.s49">In the meantime Lady de Mowbray and her friends observed the proceedings below.</s> <s sid="50" id="sybil.c69.s50">When the main body had advanced within a few hundred yards of the castle, they halted and seated themselves on the turf.</s> <s sid="51" id="sybil.c69.s51">This step re-assured the garrison: it was generally held to indicate that the intentions of the invaders were not of a very settled or hostile character; that they had visited the place probably in a spirit of frolic, and if met with tact and civility might ultimately be induced to retire from it without much annoyance.</s> <s sid="52" id="sybil.c69.s52">This was evidently the opinion of Mr Mountchesney from the first, and when an uncouth being on a white mule, attended by twenty or thirty miners, advanced to the castle and asked for Lord de Mowbray, Mr Mountchesney met them with kindness, saying that he regretted his father-in-law was absent, expressed his readiness to represent him, and enquired their pleasure.</s> <s sid="53" id="sybil.c69.s53">His courteous bearing evidently had an influence on the Bishop, who dropping his usual brutal tone mumbled something about his wish to drink Lord de Mowbray's health.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="sybil.c69.p17" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="sybil.c69.s54"><qs/>"You shall all drink his health,"<qe/> said Mr Mountchesney humouring him, and he gave directions that a couple of barrels of ale should be broached in the park before the castle.</s> <s sid="55" id="sybil.c69.s55">The Bishop was pleased, the people were in good humour, some men began dancing, it seemed that the cloud had blown over, and Mr Mountchesney sent up a bulletin to Lady de Mowbray that all danger was past and that he hoped in ten minutes they would all have disappeared.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="sybil.c69.p18"><s sid="56" id="sybil.c69.s56">The ten minutes had expired: the Bishop was still drinking ale, and Mr Mountchesney still making civil speeches and keeping his immediate attendants in humour.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="sybil.c69.p19" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="sybil.c69.s57"><qs/>"I wish they would go,"<qe/> said Lady de Mowbray.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="sybil.c69.p20" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="sybil.c69.s58"><qs/>"How wonderfully Alfred has managed them,"<qe/> said Lady Joan.</s> <s sid="59" id="sybil.c69.s59"><qs/>"After all,"<qe/><sss/> said Lady Maud, <sse/><qs/>"it must be confessed that the people--"<qe/>  Her sentence was interrupted; Harold who had been shut out but who had laid down without quietly, though moaning at intervals, now sprang at the door with so much force that it trembled on its hinges, while the dog again barked with renewed violence.</s> <s sid="60" id="sybil.c69.s60">Sybil went to him: he seized her dress with his teeth and would have pulled her away.</s> <s sid="61" id="sybil.c69.s61">Suddenly uncouth and mysterious sounds were heard, there was a loud shriek, the gong in the hail thundered, the great alarum-bell of the tower sounded without, and the housekeeper followed by the female domestics rushed into the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="sybil.c69.p21" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="sybil.c69.s62"><qs/>"O! my lady, my lady,"<qe/><sls/> they all exclaimed at the same time, <sle/><qs/>"the Hell-cats are breaking into the castle."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="sybil.c69.p22" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="sybil.c69.s63">Before any one of the terrified company could reply, the voice of Mr Mountchesney was heard.</s> <s sid="64" id="sybil.c69.s64">He was approaching them; he was no longer calm.</s> <s sid="65" id="sybil.c69.s65">He hurried into the room; he was pale, evidently greatly alarmed.</s> <s sid="66" id="sybil.c69.s66"><qs/>"I have come to you,"<qe/><sss/> he said; <sse/><qs/>"these fellows have got in below.</s> <s sid="67" id="sybil.c69.s67">While there is time and we can manage them, you must leave the place."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="sybil.c69.p23" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="sybil.c69.s68"><qs/>"I am ready for anything."<qe/>  said Lady de Mowbray.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="sybil.c69.p24" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="sybil.c69.s69">Lady Joan and Lady Maud wrung their hands in frantic terror.</s> <s sid="70" id="sybil.c69.s70">Sybil very pale said <qs/>"Let me go down; I may know some of these men."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="sybil.c69.p25" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="sybil.c69.s71"><qs/>"No, no,"<qe/> said Mr Mountchesney.</s> <s sid="72" id="sybil.c69.s72"><qs/>"They are not Mowbray people.</s> <s sid="73" id="sybil.c69.s73">It would not he safe."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="sybil.c69.p26"><s sid="74" id="sybil.c69.s74">Dreadful sounds were now heard; a blending of shouts and oaths and hideous merriment.</s> <s sid="75" id="sybil.c69.s75">Their hearts trembled.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="sybil.c69.p27" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="sybil.c69.s76"><qs/>"The mob are in the house, sir,"<qe/> called out Mr Bentley rushing up to them.</s> <s sid="77" id="sybil.c69.s77"><qs/>"They say they will see everything."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="sybil.c69.p28" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="sybil.c69.s78"><qs/>"Let them see everything,"<qe/><sss/> said Lady de Mowbray, <sse/><qs/>"but make a condition that they first let us go.</s> <s sid="79" id="sybil.c69.s79">Try Alfred, try to manage them before they are utterly ungovernable."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="sybil.c69.p29"><s sid="80" id="sybil.c69.s80">Mr Mountchesney again left them on this desperate mission.</s> <s sid="81" id="sybil.c69.s81">Lady de Mowbray and all the women remained in the chamber.</s> <s sid="82" id="sybil.c69.s82">Not a word was spoken: the silence was complete.</s> <s sid="83" id="sybil.c69.s83">Even the maid-servants had ceased to sigh and sob.</s> <s sid="84" id="sybil.c69.s84">A feeling something like desperation was stealing over them.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="sybil.c69.p30"><s sid="85" id="sybil.c69.s85">The dreadful sounds continued increased.</s> <s sid="86" id="sybil.c69.s86">They seemed to approach nearer.</s> <s sid="87" id="sybil.c69.s87">It was impossible to distinguish a word, and yet their import was frightful and ferocious.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="sybil.c69.p31" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="sybil.c69.s88"><qs/>"Lord have mercy on us all!"<qe/> exclaimed the housekeeper unable to restrain herself.</s> <s sid="89" id="sybil.c69.s89">The maids began to cry.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="sybil.c69.p32" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="sybil.c69.s90">After an absence of about five minutes Mr Mountchesney again hurried in and leading away Lady de Mowbray, he said, <qs/>"You haven't a moment to lose.</s> <s sid="91" id="sybil.c69.s91">Follow us!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="sybil.c69.p33"><s sid="92" id="sybil.c69.s92">There was a general rush, and following Mr Mountchesney they passed rapidly through several apartments, the fearful noises every moment increasing, until they reached the library which opened on the terrace.</s> <s sid="93" id="sybil.c69.s93">The windows were broken, the terrace crowded with people, several of the mob were in the room, even Lady de Mowbray cried out and fell back.</s> </p>
