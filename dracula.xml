<p pid="1" id="dracula.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="dracula.c1.s1">3 May.</s> <s sid="2" id="dracula.c1.s2">Bistritz.--Left Munich at 8:35 P.M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late.</s> <s sid="3" id="dracula.c1.s3">Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets.</s> <s sid="4" id="dracula.c1.s4">I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="dracula.c1.p2"><s sid="5" id="dracula.c1.s5">The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="dracula.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="dracula.c1.s6">We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.</s> <s sid="7" id="dracula.c1.s7">Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale.</s> <s sid="8" id="dracula.c1.s8">I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty.</s> <s sid="9" id="dracula.c1.s9">(Mem. get recipe for Mina.)</s> <s sid="10" id="dracula.c1.s10">I asked the waiter, and he said it was called <qs/>"paprika hendl,"<qe/> and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="dracula.c1.p4"><s sid="11" id="dracula.c1.s11">I found my smattering of German very useful here, indeed, I don't know how I should be able to get on without it.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="dracula.c1.p5"><s sid="12" id="dracula.c1.s12">Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="dracula.c1.p6"><s sid="13" id="dracula.c1.s13">I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia, and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="dracula.c1.p7"><s sid="14" id="dracula.c1.s14">I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordance Survey Maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place.</s> <s sid="15" id="dracula.c1.s15">I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="dracula.c1.p8"><s sid="16" id="dracula.c1.s16">In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:</s> <s sid="17" id="dracula.c1.s17">Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the East and North.</s> <s sid="18" id="dracula.c1.s18">I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns.</s> <s sid="19" id="dracula.c1.s19">This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="dracula.c1.p9"><s sid="20" id="dracula.c1.s20">I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting.</s> <s sid="21" id="dracula.c1.s21">(Mem., I must ask the Count all about them.)</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="dracula.c1.p10"><s sid="22" id="dracula.c1.s22">I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had all sorts of queer dreams.</s> <s sid="23" id="dracula.c1.s23">There was a dog howling all night under my window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was still thirsty.</s> <s sid="24" id="dracula.c1.s24">Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="dracula.c1.p11"><s sid="25" id="dracula.c1.s25">I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was "mamaliga", and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call "impletata".</s> <s sid="26" id="dracula.c1.s26">(Mem., get recipe for this also.)</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="dracula.c1.p12"><s sid="27" id="dracula.c1.s27">I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="dracula.c1.p13"><s sid="28" id="dracula.c1.s28">It seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains.</s> <s sid="29" id="dracula.c1.s29">What ought they to be in China?</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="dracula.c1.p14"><s sid="30" id="dracula.c1.s30">All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind.</s> <s sid="31" id="dracula.c1.s31">Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods.</s> <s sid="32" id="dracula.c1.s32">It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="dracula.c1.p15"><s sid="33" id="dracula.c1.s33">At every station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts of attire.</s> <s sid="34" id="dracula.c1.s34">Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets, and round hats, and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="dracula.c1.p16"><s sid="35" id="dracula.c1.s35">The women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist.</s> <s sid="36" id="dracula.c1.s36">They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petticoats under them.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="dracula.c1.p17"><s sid="37" id="dracula.c1.s37">The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass nails.</s> <s sid="38" id="dracula.c1.s38">They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches.</s> <s sid="39" id="dracula.c1.s39">They are very picturesque, but do not look prepossessing.</s> <s sid="40" id="dracula.c1.s40">On the stage they would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands.</s> <s sid="41" id="dracula.c1.s41">They are, however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-assertion.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="dracula.c1.p18"><s sid="42" id="dracula.c1.s42">It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a very interesting old place.</s> <s sid="43" id="dracula.c1.s43">Being practically on the frontier--for the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks of it.</s> <s sid="44" id="dracula.c1.s44">Fifty years ago a series of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions.</s> <s sid="45" id="dracula.c1.s45">At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="dracula.c1.p19"><s sid="46" id="dracula.c1.s46">Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="dracula.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="dracula.c1.s47">I was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white undergarment with a long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty.</s> <s sid="48" id="dracula.c1.s48">When I came close she bowed and said, <qs/>"The Herr Englishman?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="dracula.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="dracula.c1.s49"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/><sss/> I said, <sse/><qs/>"Jonathan Harker."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="dracula.c1.p22"><s sid="50" id="dracula.c1.s50">She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirtsleeves, who had followed her to the door.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="dracula.c1.p23"><s sid="51" id="dracula.c1.s51">He went, but immediately returned with a letter:</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="dracula.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="dracula.c1.s52"><qs/>"My friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians.</s> <s sid="53" id="dracula.c1.s53">I am anxiously expecting you.</s> <s sid="54" id="dracula.c1.s54">Sleep well tonight.</s> <s sid="55" id="dracula.c1.s55">At three tomorrow the diligence will start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you.</s> <s sid="56" id="dracula.c1.s56">At the Borgo Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me.</s> <s sid="57" id="dracula.c1.s57">I trust that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.--Your friend, Dracula."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="dracula.c1.p25"><s sid="58" id="dracula.c1.s58">4 May--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count, directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and pretended that he could not understand my German.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="dracula.c1.p26"><s sid="59" id="dracula.c1.s59">This could not be true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he answered my questions exactly as if he did.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="dracula.c1.p27"><s sid="60" id="dracula.c1.s60">He and his wife, the old lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of way.</s> <s sid="61" id="dracula.c1.s61">He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that was all he knew.</s> <s sid="62" id="dracula.c1.s62">When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak further.</s> <s sid="63" id="dracula.c1.s63">It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask anyone else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="dracula.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="dracula.c1.s64">Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a hysterical way:</s> <s sid="65" id="dracula.c1.s65"><qs/>"Must you go?</s> <s sid="66" id="dracula.c1.s66">Oh!</s> <s sid="67" id="dracula.c1.s67">Young Herr, must you go?"<qe/></s> <s sid="68" id="dracula.c1.s68">She was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all.</s> <s sid="69" id="dracula.c1.s69">I was just able to follow her by asking many questions.</s> <s sid="70" id="dracula.c1.s70">When I told her that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business, she asked again:</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="dracula.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="dracula.c1.s71"><qs/>"Do you know what day it is?"<qe/></s> <s sid="72" id="dracula.c1.s72">I answered that it was the fourth of May.</s> <s sid="73" id="dracula.c1.s73">She shook her head as she said again:</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="dracula.c1.p30" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="dracula.c1.s74"><qs/>"Oh, yes!</s> <s sid="75" id="dracula.c1.s75">I know that!</s> <s sid="76" id="dracula.c1.s76">I know that, but do you know what day it is?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="dracula.c1.p31"><s sid="77" id="dracula.c1.s77">On my saying that I did not understand, she went on:</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="dracula.c1.p32" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="dracula.c1.s78"><qs/>"It is the eve of St.</s> <s sid="79" id="dracula.c1.s79">George's Day.</s> <s sid="80" id="dracula.c1.s80">Do you not know that tonight, when the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have full sway?</s> <s sid="81" id="dracula.c1.s81">Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?"<qe/></s> <s sid="82" id="dracula.c1.s82">She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but without effect.</s> <s sid="83" id="dracula.c1.s83">Finally, she went down on her knees and implored me not to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="dracula.c1.p33"><s sid="84" id="dracula.c1.s84">It was all very ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable.</s> <s sid="85" id="dracula.c1.s85">However, there was business to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="dracula.c1.p34"><s sid="86" id="dracula.c1.s86">I tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="dracula.c1.p35"><s sid="87" id="dracula.c1.s87">She then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="dracula.c1.p36"><s sid="88" id="dracula.c1.s88">I did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="dracula.c1.p37" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="dracula.c1.s89">She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the rosary round my neck and said, <qs/>"For your mother's sake,"<qe/> and went out of the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="dracula.c1.p38"><s sid="90" id="dracula.c1.s90">I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still round my neck.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="dracula.c1.p39"><s sid="91" id="dracula.c1.s91">Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="dracula.c1.p40"><s sid="92" id="dracula.c1.s92">If this book should ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my goodbye.</s> <s sid="93" id="dracula.c1.s93">Here comes the coach!</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="dracula.c1.p41"><s sid="94" id="dracula.c1.s94">5 May.</s> <s sid="95" id="dracula.c1.s95">The Castle.--The gray of the morning has passed, and the sun is high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="dracula.c1.p42"><s sid="96" id="dracula.c1.s96">I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake, naturally I write till sleep comes.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="dracula.c1.p43"><s sid="97" id="dracula.c1.s97">There are many odd things to put down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="dracula.c1.p44" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="dracula.c1.s98">I dined on what they called <qs/>"robber steak"<qe/>--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red pepper, and strung on sticks, and roasted over the fire, in simple style of the London cat's meat!</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="dracula.c1.p45"><s sid="99" id="dracula.c1.s99">The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="dracula.c1.p46"><s sid="100" id="dracula.c1.s100">I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="dracula.c1.p47"><s sid="101" id="dracula.c1.s101">When I got on the coach, the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him talking to the landlady.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="dracula.c1.p48"><s sid="102" id="dracula.c1.s102">They were evidently talking of me, for every now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them pityingly.</s> <s sid="103" id="dracula.c1.s103">I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd, so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="dracula.c1.p49" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="dracula.c1.s104">I must say they were not cheering to me, for amongst them were <qs/>"Ordog"<qe/><sss/>--Satan, <sse/><qs/>"Pokol"<qe/><sss/>--hell, <sse/><qs/>"stregoica"<qe/><sss/>--witch, "vrolok" and <sse/><qs/>"vlkoslak"<qe/>--both mean the same thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is either werewolf or vampire.</s> <s sid="105" id="dracula.c1.s105">(Mem., I must ask the Count about these superstitions.)</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="dracula.c1.p50"><s sid="106" id="dracula.c1.s106">When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="dracula.c1.p51"><s sid="107" id="dracula.c1.s107">With some difficulty, I got a fellow passenger to tell me what they meant.</s> <s sid="108" id="dracula.c1.s108">He would not answer at first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="dracula.c1.p52"><s sid="109" id="dracula.c1.s109">This was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man.</s> <s sid="110" id="dracula.c1.s110">But everyone seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="dracula.c1.p53"><s sid="111" id="dracula.c1.s111">I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="dracula.c1.p54"><s sid="112" id="dracula.c1.s112">Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the boxseat,--"gotza" they call them--cracked his big whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on our journey.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="dracula.c1.p55"><s sid="113" id="dracula.c1.s113">I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have been able to throw them off so easily.</s> <s sid="114" id="dracula.c1.s114">Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road.</s> <s sid="115" id="dracula.c1.s115">There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple, plum, pear, cherry.</s> <s sid="116" id="dracula.c1.s116">And as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals.</s> <s sid="117" id="dracula.c1.s117">In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the "Mittel Land" ran the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame.</s> <s sid="118" id="dracula.c1.s118">The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste.</s> <s sid="119" id="dracula.c1.s119">I could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund.</s> <s sid="120" id="dracula.c1.s120">I was told that this road is in summertime excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows.</s> <s sid="121" id="dracula.c1.s121">In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order.</s> <s sid="122" id="dracula.c1.s122">Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="dracula.c1.p56"><s sid="123" id="dracula.c1.s123">Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves.</s> <s sid="124" id="dracula.c1.s124">Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly.</s> <s sid="125" id="dracula.c1.s125">Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water.</s> <s sid="126" id="dracula.c1.s126">One of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to be right before us.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="dracula.c7.p3"><s sid="3" id="dracula.c7.s3">One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been experienced here, with results both strange and unique.</s> <s sid="4" id="dracula.c7.s4">The weather had been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of August.</s> <s sid="5" id="dracula.c7.s5">Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in the neighborhood of Whitby.</s> <s sid="6" id="dracula.c7.s6">The steamers Emma and Scarborough made trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of 'tripping' both to and from Whitby.</s> <s sid="7" id="dracula.c7.s7">The day was unusually fine till the afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff churchyard, and from the commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of 'mares tails' high in the sky to the northwest.</s> <s sid="8" id="dracula.c7.s8">The wind was then blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical language is ranked <alt-qs/>'No. 2, light breeze.'<alt-qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="dracula.c7.p4"><s sid="9" id="dracula.c7.s9">The coastguard on duty at once made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm.</s> <s sid="10" id="dracula.c7.s10">The approach of sunset was so very beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly coloured clouds, that there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty.</s> <s sid="11" id="dracula.c7.s11">Before the sun dipped below the black mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset colour, flame, purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold, with here and there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes.</s> <s sid="12" id="dracula.c7.s12">The experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the sketches of the 'Prelude to the Great Storm' will grace the R. A and R. I. walls in May next.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="dracula.c7.p5"><s sid="13" id="dracula.c7.s13">More than one captain made up his mind then and there that his 'cobble' or his 'mule', as they term the different classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.</s> <s sid="14" id="dracula.c7.s14">The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="dracula.c7.p6"><s sid="15" id="dracula.c7.s15">There were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers, which usually hug the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but few fishing boats were in sight.</s> <s sid="16" id="dracula.c7.s16">The only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards.</s> <s sid="17" id="dracula.c7.s17">The foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in the face of her danger.</s> <s sid="18" id="dracula.c7.s18">Before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="dracula.c7.p7" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="dracula.c7.s19"><qs/>"As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="dracula.c7.p8"><s sid="20" id="dracula.c7.s20">Shortly before ten o'clock the stillness of the air grew quite oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a dischord in the great harmony of nature's silence.</s> <s sid="21" id="dracula.c7.s21">A little after midnight came a strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="dracula.c7.p9"><s sid="22" id="dracula.c7.s22">Then without warning the tempest broke.</s> <s sid="23" id="dracula.c7.s23">With a rapidity which, at the time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize, the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed.</s> <s sid="24" id="dracula.c7.s24">The waves rose in growing fury, each over-topping its fellow, till in a very few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.</s> <s sid="25" id="dracula.c7.s25">White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs.</s> <s sid="26" id="dracula.c7.s26">Others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier of Whitby Harbour.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="dracula.c7.p10"><s sid="27" id="dracula.c7.s27">The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet, or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions.</s> <s sid="28" id="dracula.c7.s28">It was found necessary to clear the entire pier from the mass of onlookers, or else the fatalities of the night would have increased manifold.</s> <s sid="29" id="dracula.c7.s29">To add to the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came drifting inland.</s> <s sid="30" id="dracula.c7.s30">White, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion, so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="dracula.c7.p11"><s sid="31" id="dracula.c7.s31">At times the mist cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the lightning, which came thick and fast, followed by such peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="dracula.c7.p12"><s sid="32" id="dracula.c7.s32">Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest.</s> <s sid="33" id="dracula.c7.s33">The sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space.</s> <s sid="34" id="dracula.c7.s34">Here and there a fishing boat, with a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast, now and again the white wings of a storm-tossed seabird.</s> <s sid="35" id="dracula.c7.s35">On the summit of the East Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been tried.</s> <s sid="36" id="dracula.c7.s36">The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in the pauses of onrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.</s> <s sid="37" id="dracula.c7.s37">Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing boat, with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers.</s> <s sid="38" id="dracula.c7.s38">As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people on the shore, a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="dracula.c7.p13"><s sid="39" id="dracula.c7.s39">Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening.</s> <s sid="40" id="dracula.c7.s40">The wind had by this time backed to the east, and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in which she now was.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="dracula.c7.p14"><s sid="41" id="dracula.c7.s41">Between her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter, it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="dracula.c7.p15"><s sid="42" id="dracula.c7.s42">It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such speed that, in the words of one old salt, "she must fetch up somewhere, if it was only in hell".</s> <s sid="43" id="dracula.c7.s43">Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than any hitherto, a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things like a gray pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before.</s> <s sid="44" id="dracula.c7.s44">The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited breathless.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="dracula.c7.p16"><s sid="45" id="dracula.c7.s45">The wind suddenly shifted to the northeast, and the remnant of the sea fog melted in the blast.</s> <s sid="46" id="dracula.c7.s46">And then, mirabile dictu, between the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed, swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and gained the safety of the harbour.</s> <s sid="47" id="dracula.c7.s47">The searchlight followed her, and a shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship.</s> <s sid="48" id="dracula.c7.s48">No other form could be seen on the deck at all.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="dracula.c7.p17"><s sid="49" id="dracula.c7.s49">A great awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man!</s> <s sid="50" id="dracula.c7.s50">However, all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words.</s> <s sid="51" id="dracula.c7.s51">The schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the southeast corner of the pier jutting under the East Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="dracula.c7.p18"><s sid="52" id="dracula.c7.s52">There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand heap.</s> <s sid="53" id="dracula.c7.s53">Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the 'top-hammer' came crashing down.</s> <s sid="54" id="dracula.c7.s54">But, strangest of all, the very instant the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow on the sand.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="dracula.c7.p19"><s sid="55" id="dracula.c7.s55">Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstones, thruffsteans or through-stones, as they call them in Whitby vernacular, actually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="dracula.c7.p20"><s sid="56" id="dracula.c7.s56">It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above.</s> <s sid="57" id="dracula.c7.s57">Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the first to climb aboard.</s> <s sid="58" id="dracula.c7.s58">The men working the searchlight, after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there.</s> <s sid="59" id="dracula.c7.s59">The coastguard ran aft, and when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion.</s> <s sid="60" id="dracula.c7.s60">This seemed to pique general curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="dracula.c7.p21"><s sid="61" id="dracula.c7.s61">It is a good way round from the West Cliff by the Draw-bridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.</s> <s sid="62" id="dracula.c7.s62">When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd, whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board.</s> <s sid="63" id="dracula.c7.s63">By the courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="dracula.c19.p18"><s sid="70" id="dracula.c19.s70">Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our enterprise to an end, but this was no ordinary case, and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose above merely physical considerations.</s> <s sid="71" id="dracula.c19.s71">After the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="dracula.c21.p2"><s sid="4" id="dracula.c21.s4">When I came to Renfield's room I found him lying on the floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood.</s> <s sid="5" id="dracula.c21.s5">When I went to move him, it became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries.</s> <s sid="6" id="dracula.c21.s6">There seemed none of the unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity.</s> <s sid="7" id="dracula.c21.s7">As the face was exposed I could see that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the floor.</s> <s sid="8" id="dracula.c21.s8">Indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood originated.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="dracula.c21.p3" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="dracula.c21.s9">The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned him over, <qs/>"I think, sir, his back is broken.</s> <s sid="10" id="dracula.c21.s10">See, both his right arm and leg and the whole side of his face are paralysed."<qe/></s> <s sid="11" id="dracula.c21.s11">How such a thing could have happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure.</s> <s sid="12" id="dracula.c21.s12">He seemed quite bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said, <qs/>"I can't understand the two things.</s> <s sid="13" id="dracula.c21.s13">He could mark his face like that by beating his own head on the floor.</s> <s sid="14" id="dracula.c21.s14">I saw a young woman do it once at the Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her.</s> <s sid="15" id="dracula.c21.s15">And I suppose he might have broken his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward kink.</s> <s sid="16" id="dracula.c21.s16">But for the life of me I can't imagine how the two things occurred.</s> <s sid="17" id="dracula.c21.s17">If his back was broke, he couldn't beat his head, and if his face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="dracula.c21.p4" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="dracula.c21.s18">I said to him, <qs/>"Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once.</s> <s sid="19" id="dracula.c21.s19">I want him without an instant's delay."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="dracula.c21.p5" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="dracula.c21.s20">The man ran off, and within a few minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared.</s> <s sid="21" id="dracula.c21.s21">When he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and then turned to me.</s> <s sid="22" id="dracula.c21.s22">I think he recognized my thought in my eyes, for he said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant, <qs/>"Ah, a sad accident!</s> <s sid="23" id="dracula.c21.s23">He will need very careful watching, and much attention.</s> <s sid="24" id="dracula.c21.s24">I shall stay with you myself, but I shall first dress myself.</s> <s sid="25" id="dracula.c21.s25">If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="dracula.c21.p12" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="dracula.c21.s48">I nodded, and held the door open till they had entered, then I closed it again.</s> <s sid="49" id="dracula.c21.s49">When Quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the floor, he said softly, <qs/>"My God!</s> <s sid="50" id="dracula.c21.s50">What has happened to him?</s> <s sid="51" id="dracula.c21.s51">Poor, poor devil!"<qe/></s> </p>
