<stru>Jane Eyre



by Charlotte Bronte</stru>



<stru>PREFACE



A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre" being unnecessary,

I gave none:  this second edition demands a few words both of

acknowledgment and miscellaneous remark.



My thanks are due in three quarters.



To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain

tale with few pretensions.



To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to

an obscure aspirant.



To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their

practical sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and

unrecommended Author.



The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and

I must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite:

so are certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only

large-hearted and high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling

stranger; to them, i.e., to my Publishers and the select Reviewers,

I say cordially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.



Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved

me, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but

not, therefore, to be overlooked.  I mean the timorous or carping

few who doubt the tendency of such books as "Jane Eyre:"  in whose

eyes whatever is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest

against bigotry -- that parent of crime -- an insult to piety, that

regent of God on earth.  I would suggest to such doubters certain

obvious distinctions; I would remind them of certain simple truths.



Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.

To attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask

from the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to

the Crown of Thorns.



These things and deeds are diametrically opposed:  they are

as distinct as is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them:

they should not be confounded:  appearance should not be mistaken

for truth; narrow human doctrines, that only tend to elate and

magnify a few, should not be substituted for the world-redeeming

creed of Christ.  There is -- I repeat it -- a difference; and it

is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly and clearly the

line of separation between them.



The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been

accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external

show pass for sterling worth -- to let white-washed walls vouch for

clean shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose

-- to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it -- to penetrate

the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics:  but hate as it will, it

is indebted to him.



Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning

him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah

better; yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but

stopped his ears to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.



There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle

delicate ears:  who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones

of society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings

of Judah and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power

as prophet-like and as vital -- a mien as dauntless and as daring.

Is the satirist of "Vanity Fair" admired in high places?  I cannot

tell; but I think if some of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek

fire of his sarcasm, and over whom he flashes the levin-brand

of his denunciation, were to take his warnings in time -- they or

their seed might yet escape a fatal Rimoth-Gilead.



Why have I alluded to this man?  I have alluded to him, Reader,

because I think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique

than his contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him

as the first social regenerator of the day -- as the very master

of that working corps who would restore to rectitude the warped

system of things; because I think no commentator on his writings

has yet found the comparison that suits him, the terms which rightly

characterise his talent.  They say he is like Fielding:  they talk

of his wit, humour, comic powers.  He resembles Fielding as an eagle

does a vulture:  Fielding could stoop on carrion, but Thackeray

never does.  His wit is bright, his humour attractive, but both

bear the same relation to his serious genius that the mere lambent

sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-cloud does to

the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have alluded

to Mr. Thackeray, because to him -- if he will accept the tribute

of a total stranger -- I have dedicated this second edition of

"JANE EYRE."

NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION



I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane

Eyre" affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to

explain that my claim to the title of novelist rests on this one

work alone.  If, therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction

has been attributed to me, an honour is awarded where it is not

merited; and consequently, denied where it is justly due.



This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already

have been made, and to prevent future errors.

<p pid="1" id="jane.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="jane.c1.s1">There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.</s> <s sid="2" id="jane.c1.s2">We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs.</s> <s sid="3" id="jane.c1.s3">Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="jane.c1.p2"><s sid="4" id="jane.c1.s4">I was glad of it:</s> <s sid="5" id="jane.c1.s5">I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons:  dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="jane.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="jane.c1.s6">The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room:  she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy.</s> <s sid="7" id="jane.c1.s7">Me, she had dispensed from joining the group; saying, <qs/>"She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner -- something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were -- she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="jane.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="jane.c1.s8"><qs/>"What does Bessie say I have done?"<qe/></s> <s sid="9" id="jane.c1.s9">I asked.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="jane.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="jane.c1.s10"><qs/>"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.</s> <s sid="11" id="jane.c1.s11">Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="jane.c1.p6"><s sid="12" id="jane.c1.s12">A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.</s> <s sid="13" id="jane.c1.s13">It contained a bookcase:</s> <s sid="14" id="jane.c1.s14">I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures.</s> <s sid="15" id="jane.c1.s15">I mounted into the window-seat:  gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="jane.c1.p7"><s sid="16" id="jane.c1.s16">Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day.</s> <s sid="17" id="jane.c1.s17">At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.</s> <s sid="18" id="jane.c1.s18">Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="jane.c1.p8"><s sid="19" id="jane.c1.s19">I returned to my book -- Bewick's History of British Birds:  the letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank.</s> <s sid="20" id="jane.c1.s20">They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of "the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape -</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="jane.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="jane.c1.s21"><qs/>"Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls, Boils round the naked, melancholy isles Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="jane.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="jane.c1.s22">Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with <qs/>"the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space, -- that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."<qe/></s> <s sid="23" id="jane.c1.s23">Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own:  shadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains, but strangely impressive.</s> <s sid="24" id="jane.c1.s24">The words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="jane.c1.p11"><s sid="25" id="jane.c1.s25">I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the hour of eventide.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="jane.c1.p12"><s sid="26" id="jane.c1.s26">The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="jane.c1.p13"><s sid="27" id="jane.c1.s27">The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over quickly:  it was an object of terror.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="jane.c1.p14"><s sid="28" id="jane.c1.s28">So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="jane.c1.p15"><s sid="29" id="jane.c1.s29">Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="jane.c1.p16"><s sid="30" id="jane.c1.s30">With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy:  happy at least in my way.</s> <s sid="31" id="jane.c1.s31">I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.</s> <s sid="32" id="jane.c1.s32">The breakfast-room door opened.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="jane.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="jane.c1.s33"><qs/>"Boh!</s> <s sid="34" id="jane.c1.s34">Madam Mope!"<qe/>  cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he found the room apparently empty.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="jane.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="jane.c1.s35"><qs/>"Where the dickens is she!"<qe/>  he continued.</s> <s sid="36" id="jane.c1.s36"><qs/>"Lizzy!</s> <s sid="37" id="jane.c1.s37">Georgy!</s> <s sid="38" id="jane.c1.s38">(calling to his sisters) Joan is not here:  tell mama she is run out into the rain -- bad animal!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="jane.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="jane.c1.s39"><qs/>"It is well I drew the curtain,"<qe/> thought I; and I wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-place:  nor would John Reed have found it out himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just put her head in at the door, and said at once -</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="jane.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="jane.c1.s40"><qs/>"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="jane.c1.p21"><s sid="41" id="jane.c1.s41">And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by the said Jack.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="jane.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="jane.c1.s42"><qs/>"What do you want?"<qe/></s> <s sid="43" id="jane.c1.s43">I asked, with awkward diffidence.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="jane.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="jane.c1.s44"><qs/>"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'"<qe/>  was the answer.</s> <s sid="45" id="jane.c1.s45"><qs/>"I want you to come here;"<qe/> and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="jane.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="jane.c1.s46">John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten:  large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities.</s> <s sid="47" id="jane.c1.s47">He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.</s> <s sid="48" id="jane.c1.s48">He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month or two, <qs/>"on account of his delicate health."<qe/></s> <s sid="49" id="jane.c1.s49">Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after home.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="jane.c1.p25"><s sid="50" id="jane.c1.s50">John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy to me.</s> <s sid="51" id="jane.c1.s51">He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.</s> <s sid="52" id="jane.c1.s52">There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the subject:  she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind her back.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="jane.c1.p26"><s sid="53" id="jane.c1.s53">Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair:  he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots:</s> <s sid="54" id="jane.c1.s54">I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it.</s> <s sid="55" id="jane.c1.s55">I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.</s> <s sid="56" id="jane.c1.s56">I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="jane.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="jane.c1.s57"><qs/>"That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,"<qe/><sss/> said he, <sse/><qs/>"and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="jane.c1.p28"><s sid="58" id="jane.c1.s58">Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="jane.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="jane.c1.s59"><qs/>"What were you doing behind the curtain?"<qe/>  he asked.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="jane.c1.p30" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="jane.c1.s60"><qs/>"I was reading."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="jane.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="jane.c1.s61"><qs/>"Show the book."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="jane.c1.p32"><s sid="62" id="jane.c1.s62">I returned to the window and fetched it thence.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="jane.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="jane.c1.s63"><qs/>"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.</s> <s sid="64" id="jane.c1.s64">Now, I'll teach you to rummage my bookshelves:  for they ARE mine; all the house belongs to me, or will do in a few years.</s> <s sid="65" id="jane.c1.s65">Go and stand by the door, out of the way of the mirror and the windows."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="jane.c1.p34"><s sid="66" id="jane.c1.s66">I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm:  not soon enough, however; the volume was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and cutting it.</s> <s sid="67" id="jane.c1.s67">The cut bled, the pain was sharp:  my terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="jane.c1.p35" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="jane.c1.s68"><qs/>"Wicked and cruel boy!"<qe/></s> <s sid="69" id="jane.c1.s69">I said.</s> <s sid="70" id="jane.c1.s70"><qs/>"You are like a murderer -- you are like a slave-driver -- you are like the Roman emperors!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="jane.c1.p37" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="jane.c1.s73"><qs/>"What!  what!"<qe/>  he cried.</s> <s sid="74" id="jane.c1.s74">"Did she say that to me?</s> <s sid="75" id="jane.c1.s75">Did you hear her, Eliza and Georgiana?</s> <s sid="76" id="jane.c1.s76">Won't I tell mama?  but first -- "</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER IV</title>

<p pid="1" id="jane.c4.p1"><s sid="1" id="jane.c4.s1">From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a motive for wishing to get well:  a change seemed near, -- I desired and waited it in silence.</s> <s sid="2" id="jane.c4.s2">It tarried, however:  days and weeks passed:</s> <s sid="3" id="jane.c4.s3">I had regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the subject over which I brooded.</s> <s sid="4" id="jane.c4.s4">Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a severe eye, but seldom addressed me:  since my illness, she had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room.</s> <s sid="5" id="jane.c4.s5">Not a hint, however, did she drop about sending me to school:  still I felt an instinctive certainty that she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable and rooted aversion.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="jane.c4.p2"><s sid="6" id="jane.c4.s6">Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as little as possible:</s> <s sid="7" id="jane.c4.s7">John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.</s> <s sid="8" id="jane.c4.s8">I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he was already with his mama.</s> <s sid="9" id="jane.c4.s9">I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had flown at him like a mad cat:  he was stopped rather harshly -</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="jane.c4.p3" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="jane.c4.s10"><qs/>"Don't talk to me about her, John:</s> <s sid="11" id="jane.c4.s11">I told you not to go near her; she is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters should associate with her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="jane.c4.p4"><s sid="12" id="jane.c4.s12">Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all deliberating on my words -</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="jane.c4.p5" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="jane.c4.s13"><qs/>"They are not fit to associate with me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="jane.c4.p6"><s sid="14" id="jane.c4.s14">Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one syllable during the remainder of the day.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="jane.c4.p7" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="jane.c4.s15"><qs/>"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?"<qe/>  was my scarcely voluntary demand.</s> <s sid="16" id="jane.c4.s16">I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:  something spoke out of me over which I had no control.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="jane.c4.p8" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="jane.c4.s17"><qs/>"What?"<qe/>  said Mrs. Reed under her breath:  her usually cold composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or fiend.</s> <s sid="18" id="jane.c4.s18">I was now in for it.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="jane.c4.p9" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="jane.c4.s19"><qs/>"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can papa and mama:  they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you wish me dead."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="jane.c4.p10"><s sid="20" id="jane.c4.s20">Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits:  she shook me most soundly, she boxed both my ears, and then left me without a word.</s> <s sid="21" id="jane.c4.s21">Bessie supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a roof.</s> <s sid="22" id="jane.c4.s22">I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging in my breast.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="jane.c4.p11"><s sid="23" id="jane.c4.s23">November, December, and half of January passed away.</s> <s sid="24" id="jane.c4.s24">Christmas and the New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer; presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.</s> <s sid="25" id="jane.c4.s25">From every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded:  my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.</s> <s sid="26" id="jane.c4.s26">When tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable.</s> <s sid="27" id="jane.c4.s27">To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company, for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.</s> <s sid="28" id="jane.c4.s28">But Bessie, as soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing the candle along with her.</s> <s sid="29" id="jane.c4.s29">I then sat with my doll on my knee till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.</s> <s sid="30" id="jane.c4.s30">To this crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature scarecrow.</s> <s sid="31" id="jane.c4.s31">It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of sensation.</s> <s sid="32" id="jane.c4.s32">I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it to be happy likewise.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="jane.c4.p12" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="jane.c4.s33">Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs:  sometimes she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper -- a bun or a cheese-cake -- then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me, and said, <qs/>"Good night, Miss Jane."<qe/></s> <s sid="34" id="jane.c4.s34">When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often wont to do.</s> <s sid="35" id="jane.c4.s35">Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her nursery tales.</s> <s sid="36" id="jane.c4.s36">She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and person are correct.</s> <s sid="37" id="jane.c4.s37">I remember her as a slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or justice:  still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at Gateshead Hall.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="jane.c4.p13"><s sid="38" id="jane.c4.s38">It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:</s> <s sid="39" id="jane.c4.s39">Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond:  and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she thus obtained.</s> <s sid="40" id="jane.c4.s40">She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell:  and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby.</s> <s sid="41" id="jane.c4.s41">As to her money, she first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious rate of interest -- fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="jane.c4.p14"><s sid="42" id="jane.c4.s42">Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.</s> <s sid="43" id="jane.c4.s43">I was making my bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &amp;c.).</s> <s sid="44" id="jane.c4.s44">Having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="jane.c4.p15"><s sid="45" id="jane.c4.s45">From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage- road, and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a carriage roll through.</s> <s sid="46" id="jane.c4.s46">I watched it ascending the drive with indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.</s> <s sid="47" id="jane.c4.s47">All this being nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.</s> <s sid="48" id="jane.c4.s48">The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out the crumbs on the window- sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="jane.c4.p16" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="jane.c4.s49"><qs/>"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?</s> <s sid="50" id="jane.c4.s50">Have you washed your hands and face this morning?"<qe/></s> <s sid="51" id="jane.c4.s51">I gave another tug before I answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied -</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="jane.c4.p17" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="jane.c4.s52"><qs/>"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="jane.c4.p18" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="jane.c4.s53"><qs/>"Troublesome, careless child!  and what are you doing now?</s> <s sid="54" id="jane.c4.s54">You look quite red, as if you had been about some mischief:  what were you opening the window for?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="jane.c4.p19"><s sid="55" id="jane.c4.s55">I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand, inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="jane.c4.p20"><s sid="56" id="jane.c4.s56">I would have asked who wanted me:</s> <s sid="57" id="jane.c4.s57">I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon me.</s> <s sid="58" id="jane.c4.s58">I slowly descended.</s> <s sid="59" id="jane.c4.s59">For nearly three months, I had never been called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on which it dismayed me to intrude.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="jane.c4.p21"><s sid="60" id="jane.c4.s60">I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and I stopped, intimidated and trembling.</s> <s sid="61" id="jane.c4.s61">What a miserable little poltroon had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!</s> <s sid="62" id="jane.c4.s62">I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I MUST enter.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="jane.c4.p22" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="jane.c4.s63"><qs/>"Who could want me?"<qe/></s> <s sid="64" id="jane.c4.s64">I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.</s> <s sid="65" id="jane.c4.s65"><qs/>"What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?</s> <s sid="66" id="jane.c4.s66">-- a man or a woman?"<qe/></s> <s sid="67" id="jane.c4.s67">The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low, I looked up at -- a black pillar!</s> <s sid="68" id="jane.c4.s68">-- such, at least, appeared to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:  the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft by way of capital.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="jane.c4.p23" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="jane.c4.s69">Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger with the words:</s> <s sid="70" id="jane.c4.s70"><qs/>"This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="jane.c4.p24" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="jane.c4.s71">HE, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice, <qs/>"Her size is small:  what is her age?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="jane.c4.p25" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="jane.c4.s72"><qs/>"Ten years."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="jane.c4.p26" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="jane.c4.s73"><qs/>"So much?"<qe/>  was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for some minutes.</s> <s sid="74" id="jane.c4.s74">Presently he addressed me -- <qs/>"Your name, little girl?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="jane.c4.p27" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="jane.c4.s75"><qs/>"Jane Eyre, sir."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="jane.c4.p28"><s sid="76" id="jane.c4.s76">In uttering these words I looked up:  he seemed to me a tall gentleman; but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="jane.c4.p29" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="jane.c4.s77"><qs/>"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="jane.c4.p31" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="jane.c4.s81"><qs/>"Sorry indeed to hear it!  she and I must have some talk;"<qe/> and bending from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm- chair opposite Mrs. Reed's.</s> <s sid="82" id="jane.c4.s82"><qs/>"Come here,"<qe/> he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="jane.c7.p1"><s sid="1" id="jane.c7.s1">My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks.</s> <s sid="2" id="jane.c7.s2">The fear of failure in these points harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these were no trifles.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="jane.c7.p2"><s sid="3" id="jane.c7.s3">During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air.</s> <s sid="4" id="jane.c7.s4">Our clothing was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold:  we had no boots, the snow got into our shoes and melted there:  our ungloved hands became numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet:</s> <s sid="5" id="jane.c7.s5">I remember well the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning.</s> <s sid="6" id="jane.c7.s6">Then the scanty supply of food was distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.</s> <s sid="7" id="jane.c7.s7">From this deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger pupils:  whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.</s> <s sid="8" id="jane.c7.s8">Many a time I have shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="jane.c7.p3"><s sid="9" id="jane.c7.s9">Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.</s> <s sid="10" id="jane.c7.s10">We had to walk two miles to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.</s> <s sid="11" id="jane.c7.s11">We set out cold, we arrived at church colder:  during the morning service we became almost paralysed.</s> <s sid="12" id="jane.c7.s12">It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary meals, was served round between the services.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="jane.c7.p4"><s sid="13" id="jane.c7.s13">At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="jane.c7.p5" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="jane.c7.s14">I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our spirits, and march forward, as she said, <qs/>"like stalwart soldiers."<qe/></s> <s sid="15" id="jane.c7.s15">The other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="jane.c7.p6"><s sid="16" id="jane.c7.s16">How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!</s> <s sid="17" id="jane.c7.s17">But, to the little ones at least, this was denied:  each hearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="jane.c7.p7"><s sid="18" id="jane.c7.s18">A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of bread -- a whole, instead of a half, slice -- with the delicious addition of a thin scrape of butter:  it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.</s> <s sid="19" id="jane.c7.s19">I generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was invariably obliged to part with.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="jane.c7.p8"><s sid="20" id="jane.c7.s20">The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St.</s> <s sid="21" id="jane.c7.s21">Matthew; and in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible yawns attested her weariness.</s> <s sid="22" id="jane.c7.s22">A frequent interlude of these performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.</s> <s sid="23" id="jane.c7.s23">The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.</s> <s sid="24" id="jane.c7.s24">Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then propped up with the monitors' high stools.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="jane.c7.p9"><s sid="25" id="jane.c7.s25">I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon:  his absence was a relief to me.</s> <s sid="26" id="jane.c7.s26">I need not say that I had my own reasons for dreading his coming:  but come he did at last.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="jane.c7.p10"><s sid="27" id="jane.c7.s27">One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes, raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just passing:</s> <s sid="28" id="jane.c7.s28">I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when, two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose en masse, it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance they thus greeted.</s> <s sid="29" id="jane.c7.s29">A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.</s> <s sid="30" id="jane.c7.s30">I now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.</s> <s sid="31" id="jane.c7.s31">Yes, I was right:  it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="jane.c7.p11" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="jane.c7.s32">I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition, &amp;c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and the teachers of my vicious nature.</s> <s sid="33" id="jane.c7.s33">All along I had been dreading the fulfilment of this promise, -- I had been looking out daily for the <qs/>"Coming Man,"<qe/> whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever:  now there he was.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="jane.c7.p12"><s sid="34" id="jane.c7.s34">He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear:</s> <s sid="35" id="jane.c7.s35">I did not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt.</s> <s sid="36" id="jane.c7.s36">I listened too; and as I happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what he said:  its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="jane.c7.p13" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="jane.c7.s37"><qs/>"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I sorted the needles to match.</s> <s sid="38" id="jane.c7.s38">You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be careless and lose them.</s> <s sid="39" id="jane.c7.s39">And, O ma'am!</s> <s sid="40" id="jane.c7.s40">I wish the woollen stockings were better looked to!</s> <s sid="41" id="jane.c7.s41">-- when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair:  from the size of the holes in them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="jane.c7.p14"><s sid="42" id="jane.c7.s42">He paused.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="jane.c7.p15" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="jane.c7.s43"><qs/>"Your directions shall be attended to, sir,"<qe/> said Miss Temple.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="jane.c7.p16" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="jane.c7.s44"><qs/>"And, ma'am,"<qe/><sss/> he continued, <sse/><qs/>"the laundress tells me some of the girls have two clean tuckers in the week:  it is too much; the rules limit them to one."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="jane.c7.p17" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="jane.c7.s45"><qs/>"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.</s> <s sid="46" id="jane.c7.s46">Agnes and Catherine Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the occasion."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="jane.c7.p18"><s sid="47" id="jane.c7.s47">Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="jane.c7.p19" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="jane.c7.s48"><qs/>"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur too often.</s> <s sid="49" id="jane.c7.s49">And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past fortnight.</s> <s sid="50" id="jane.c7.s50">How is this?</s> <s sid="51" id="jane.c7.s51">I looked over the regulations, and I find no such meal as lunch mentioned.</s> <s sid="52" id="jane.c7.s52">Who introduced this innovation?  and by what authority?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="jane.c7.p20" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="jane.c7.s53"><qs/>"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,"<qe/> replied Miss Temple:</s> <s sid="54" id="jane.c7.s54"><qs/>"the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="jane.c7.p21" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="jane.c7.s55">"Madam, allow me an instant.</s> <s sid="56" id="jane.c7.s56">You are aware that my plan in bringing up these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence, but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.</s> <s sid="57" id="jane.c7.s57">Should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.</s> <s sid="58" id="jane.c7.s58">A brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His divine consolations, <qs/>"If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy are ye."<qe/></s> <s sid="59" id="jane.c7.s59">Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="jane.c7.p22"><s sid="60" id="jane.c7.s60">Mr. Brocklehurst again paused -- perhaps overcome by his feelings.</s> <s sid="61" id="jane.c7.s61">Miss Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble, appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material; especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified severity.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="jane.c7.p23"><s sid="62" id="jane.c7.s62">Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind his back, majestically surveyed the whole school.</s> <s sid="63" id="jane.c7.s63">Suddenly his eye gave a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used -</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="jane.c7.p24" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="jane.c7.s64"><qs/>"Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what -- WHAT is that girl with curled hair?</s> <s sid="65" id="jane.c7.s65">Red hair, ma'am, curled -- curled all over?"<qe/></s> <s sid="66" id="jane.c7.s66">And extending his cane he pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="jane.c7.p25" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="jane.c7.s67"><qs/>"It is Julia Severn,"<qe/> replied Miss Temple, very quietly.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="jane.c7.p26" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="jane.c7.s68"><qs/>"Julia Severn, ma'am!</s> <s sid="69" id="jane.c7.s69">And why has she, or any other, curled hair?</s> <s sid="70" id="jane.c7.s70">Why, in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she conform to the world so openly -- here in an evangelical, charitable establishment -- as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="jane.c7.p27" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="jane.c7.s71"><qs/>"Julia's hair curls naturally,"<qe/> returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="jane.c7.p28" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="jane.c7.s72"><qs/>"Naturally!</s> <s sid="73" id="jane.c7.s73">Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls to be the children of Grace:  and why that abundance?</s> <s sid="74" id="jane.c7.s74">I have again and again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly, plainly.</s> <s sid="75" id="jane.c7.s75">Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will send a barber to-morrow:  and I see others who have far too much of the excrescence -- that tall girl, tell her to turn round.</s> <s sid="76" id="jane.c7.s76">Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="jane.c7.p29"><s sid="77" id="jane.c7.s77">Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and when the first class could take in what was required of them, they obeyed.</s> <s sid="78" id="jane.c7.s78">Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre:  it was a pity Mr. Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that, whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside was further beyond his interference than he imagined.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="jane.c7.p30"><s sid="79" id="jane.c7.s79">He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then pronounced sentence.</s> <s sid="80" id="jane.c7.s80">These words fell like the knell of doom -</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="jane.c7.p31" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="jane.c7.s81"><qs/>"All those top-knots must be cut off."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="jane.c7.p32"><s sid="82" id="jane.c7.s82">Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="jane.c7.p33" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="jane.c7.s83"><qs/>"Madam,"<qe/> he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of this world:  my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the time wasted, of -- "</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="jane.c7.p34"><s sid="84" id="jane.c7.s84">Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted:  three other visitors, ladies, now entered the room.</s> <s sid="85" id="jane.c7.s85">They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk, and furs.</s> <s sid="86" id="jane.c7.s86">The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a false front of French curls.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="jane.c7.p35"><s sid="87" id="jane.c7.s87">These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room.</s> <s sid="88" id="jane.c7.s88">It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.</s> <s sid="89" id="jane.c7.s89">They now proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories:  but I had no time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted my attention.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="jane.c7.p36"><s sid="90" id="jane.c7.s90">Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude observation.</s> <s sid="91" id="jane.c7.s91">To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to conceal my face:</s> <s sid="92" id="jane.c7.s92">I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied my forces for the worst.</s> <s sid="93" id="jane.c7.s93">It came.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="jane.c7.p37" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="jane.c7.s94"><qs/>"A careless girl!"<qe/><sls/>  said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after -- <sle/><qs/>"It is the new pupil, I perceive."<qe/></s> <s sid="95" id="jane.c7.s95">And before I could draw breath, <qs/>"I must not forget I have a word to say respecting her."<qe/></s> <s sid="96" id="jane.c7.s96">Then aloud:  how loud it seemed to me!</s> <s sid="97" id="jane.c7.s97"><qs/>"Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="jane.c7.p38"><s sid="98" id="jane.c7.s98">Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed:  but the two great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel -</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="jane.c7.p39" type="speech"><s sid="99" id="jane.c7.s99"><qs/>"Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be punished."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="jane.c7.p40"><s sid="100" id="jane.c7.s100">The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="jane.c7.p41" type="speech"><s sid="101" id="jane.c7.s101"><qs/>"Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite,"<qe/> thought I; and an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my pulses at the conviction.</s> <s sid="102" id="jane.c7.s102">I was no Helen Burns.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="jane.c7.p42" type="speech"><s sid="103" id="jane.c7.s103"><qs/>"Fetch that stool,"<qe/> said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one from which a monitor had just risen:  it was brought.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="jane.c7.p43" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="jane.c7.s104"><qs/>"Place the child upon it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="jane.c7.p44"><s sid="105" id="jane.c7.s105">And I was placed there, by whom I don't know:</s> <s sid="106" id="jane.c7.s106">I was in no condition to note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="jane.c7.p45"><s sid="107" id="jane.c7.s107">Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="jane.c7.p46" type="speech"><s sid="108" id="jane.c7.s108"><qs/>"Ladies,"<qe/><sls/> said he, turning to his family, <sle/><qs/>"Miss Temple, teachers, and children, you all see this girl?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="jane.c7.p47"><s sid="109" id="jane.c7.s109">Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses against my scorched skin.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="jane.c7.p48" type="speech"><s sid="110" id="jane.c7.s110"><qs/>"You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.</s> <s sid="111" id="jane.c7.s111">Who would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in her?</s> <s sid="112" id="jane.c7.s112">Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="jane.c7.p49"><s sid="113" id="jane.c7.s113">A pause -- in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked, must be firmly sustained.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="jane.c7.p50" type="speech"><s sid="114" id="jane.c7.s114"><qs/>"My dear children,"<qe/><sls/> pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos, <sle/><qs/>"this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little castaway:  not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and an alien.</s> <s sid="115" id="jane.c7.s115">You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports, and shut her out from your converse.</s> <s sid="116" id="jane.c7.s116">Teachers, you must watch her:  keep your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions, punish her body to save her soul:  if, indeed, such salvation be possible, for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut -- this girl is -- a liar!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="jane.c7.p51" type="speech"><s sid="117" id="jane.c7.s117">Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones whispered, <qs/>"How shocking!"<qe/></s> <s sid="118" id="jane.c7.s118">Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="jane.c7.p52" type="speech"><s sid="119" id="jane.c7.s119"><qs/>"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious example should contaminate their purity:  she has sent her here to be healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the waters to stagnate round her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="jane.c9.p2"><s sid="6" id="jane.c9.s6">I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our garden:  this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of dark stones and sparkling eddies.</s> <s sid="7" id="jane.c9.s7">How different had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!</s> <s sid="8" id="jane.c9.s8">-- when mists as chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down "ing" and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!</s> <s sid="9" id="jane.c9.s9">That beck itself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless:  it tore asunder the wood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, THAT showed only ranks of skeletons.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="jane.c9.p3"><s sid="10" id="jane.c9.s10">April advanced to May:  a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky, placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its duration.</s> <s sid="11" id="jane.c9.s11">And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its wild primrose plants:</s> <s sid="12" id="jane.c9.s12">I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.</s> <s sid="13" id="jane.c9.s13">All this I enjoyed often and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone:  for this unwonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to advert.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="jane.c9.p4"><s sid="14" id="jane.c9.s14">Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?</s> <s sid="15" id="jane.c9.s15">Assuredly, pleasant enough:  but whether healthy or not is another question.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="jane.c9.p5"><s sid="16" id="jane.c9.s16">That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an hospital.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="jane.c9.p6"><s sid="17" id="jane.c9.s17">Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to receive infection:  forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one time.</s> <s sid="18" id="jane.c9.s18">Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.</s> <s sid="19" id="jane.c9.s19">The few who continued well were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:  and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.</s> <s sid="20" id="jane.c9.s20">Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients:  she lived in the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at night.</s> <s sid="21" id="jane.c9.s21">The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove them from the seat of contagion.</s> <s sid="22" id="jane.c9.s22">Many, already smitten, went home only to die:  some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the nature of the malady forbidding delay.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="jane.c9.p7"><s sid="23" id="jane.c9.s23">While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out of doors.</s> <s sid="24" id="jane.c9.s24">Its garden, too, glowed with flowers:  hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="jane.c9.p8"><s sid="25" id="jane.c9.s25">But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked:  we lived better too.</s> <s sid="26" id="jane.c9.s26">Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now:  household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode, provided with comparative liberality.</s> <s sid="27" id="jane.c9.s27">Besides, there were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="jane.c9.p9"><s sid="28" id="jane.c9.s28">My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.</s> <s sid="29" id="jane.c9.s29">The stone was just broad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen comrade -- one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original, and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.</s> <s sid="30" id="jane.c9.s30">Some years older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification:  to my faults also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I said.</s> <s sid="31" id="jane.c9.s31">She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform, I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="jane.c9.p11"><s sid="36" id="jane.c9.s36">True, reader; and I knew and felt this:  and though I am a defective being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated my heart.</s> <s sid="37" id="jane.c9.s37">How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?</s> <s sid="38" id="jane.c9.s38">But Helen was ill at present:  for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I knew not what room upstairs.</s> <s sid="39" id="jane.c9.s39">She was not, I was told, in the hospital portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance, understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to alleviate.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="jane.c9.p12"><s sid="40" id="jane.c9.s40">I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the verandah.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="jane.c9.p13"><s sid="41" id="jane.c9.s41">One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.</s> <s sid="42" id="jane.c9.s42">When we got back, it was after moonrise:  a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's, was standing at the garden door.</s> <s sid="43" id="jane.c9.s43">Mary Ann remarked that she supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of the evening.</s> <s sid="44" id="jane.c9.s44">She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.</s> <s sid="45" id="jane.c9.s45">This done, I lingered yet a little longer:  the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon rose with such majesty in the grave east.</s> <s sid="46" id="jane.c9.s46">I was noting these things and enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never done before:-</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="jane.c9.p15"><s sid="49" id="jane.c9.s49">And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf:  it felt the one point where it stood -- the present; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging amid that chaos.</s> <s sid="50" id="jane.c9.s50">While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.</s> <s sid="51" id="jane.c9.s51">After she had seen him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I ran up to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="jane.c10.p3"><s sid="7" id="jane.c10.s7">Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a committee.</s> <s sid="8" id="jane.c10.s8">Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds:  his office of inspector, too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness, comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.</s> <s sid="9" id="jane.c10.s9">The school, thus improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.</s> <s sid="10" id="jane.c10.s10">I remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:  six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my testimony to its value and importance.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER XII</title>

<p pid="1" id="jane.c12.p1"><s sid="1" id="jane.c12.s1">The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance with the place and its inmates.</s> <s sid="2" id="jane.c12.s2">Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education and average intelligence.</s> <s sid="3" id="jane.c12.s3">My pupil was a lively child, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.</s> <s sid="4" id="jane.c12.s4">She had no great talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her below it.</s> <s sid="5" id="jane.c12.s5">She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="jane.c12.p2"><s sid="6" id="jane.c12.s6">This, par parenthese, will be thought cool language by persons who entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an idolatrous devotion:  but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.</s> <s sid="7" id="jane.c12.s7">I felt a conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet liking for her little self:  just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation of her mind and character.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="jane.c12.p3"><s sid="8" id="jane.c12.s8">Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then, when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and along dim sky-line -- that then I longed for a power of vision which might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen -- that then I desired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.</s> <s sid="9" id="jane.c12.s9">I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to behold.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="jane.c12.p4"><s sid="10" id="jane.c12.s10">Who blames me?</s> <s sid="11" id="jane.c12.s11">Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.</s> <s sid="12" id="jane.c12.s12">I could not help it:  the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes.</s> <s sid="13" id="jane.c12.s13">Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it -- and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended -- a tale my imagination created, and narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire, feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="jane.c12.p5"><s sid="14" id="jane.c12.s14">It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity:  they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it.</s> <s sid="15" id="jane.c12.s15">Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt against their lot.</s> <s sid="16" id="jane.c12.s16">Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth.</s> <s sid="17" id="jane.c12.s17">Women are supposed to be very calm generally:  but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.</s> <s sid="18" id="jane.c12.s18">It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="jane.c12.p6"><s sid="19" id="jane.c12.s19">When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh:  the same peal, the same low, slow ha!  ha!  which, when first heard, had thrilled me:</s> <s sid="20" id="jane.c12.s20">I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.</s> <s sid="21" id="jane.c12.s21">There were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could not account for the sounds she made.</s> <s sid="22" id="jane.c12.s22">Sometimes I saw her:  she would come out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader, forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.</s> <s sid="23" id="jane.c12.s23">Her appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest could attach.</s> <s sid="24" id="jane.c12.s24">I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but she seemed a person of few words:  a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="jane.c12.p7"><s sid="25" id="jane.c12.s25">The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="jane.c12.p8" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="jane.c12.s26">October, November, December passed away.</s> <s sid="27" id="jane.c12.s27">One afternoon in January, Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it, deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.</s> <s sid="28" id="jane.c12.s28">It was a fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the library through a whole long morning:</s> <s sid="29" id="jane.c12.s29">Mrs. Fairfax had just written a letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a pleasant winter afternoon walk.</s> <s sid="30" id="jane.c12.s30">Having seen Adele comfortably seated in her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and having replied to her <qs/>"Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.</s> <s sid="31" id="jane.c12.s31">Jeannette,"<qe/> with a kiss I set out.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="jane.c12.p9"><s sid="32" id="jane.c12.s32">The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.</s> <s sid="33" id="jane.c12.s33">It was three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry:  the charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and pale-beaming sun.</s> <s sid="34" id="jane.c12.s34">I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.</s> <s sid="35" id="jane.c12.s35">If a breath of air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.</s> <s sid="36" id="jane.c12.s36">Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="jane.c12.p10"><s sid="37" id="jane.c12.s37">This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.</s> <s sid="38" id="jane.c12.s38">Gathering my mantle about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold, though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since.</s> <s sid="39" id="jane.c12.s39">From my seat I could look down on Thornfield:  the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.</s> <s sid="40" id="jane.c12.s40">I lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and clear behind them.</s> <s sid="41" id="jane.c12.s41">I then turned eastward.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="jane.c12.p11"><s sid="42" id="jane.c12.s42">On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys:  it was yet a mile distant, but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.</s> <s sid="43" id="jane.c12.s43">My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could not tell:  but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks threading their passes.</s> <s sid="44" id="jane.c12.s44">That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="jane.c12.p12"><s sid="45" id="jane.c12.s45">A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so far away and so clear:  a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and blended clouds where tint melts into tint.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="jane.c12.p13" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="jane.c12.s46">The din was on the causeway:  a horse was coming; the windings of the lane yet hid it, but it approached.</s> <s sid="47" id="jane.c12.s47">I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.</s> <s sid="48" id="jane.c12.s48">In those days I was young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind:  the memories of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give.</s> <s sid="49" id="jane.c12.s49">As this horse approached, and as I watched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales, wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a <qs/>"Gytrash,"<qe/> which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon me.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="jane.c12.p14" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="jane.c12.s50">It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp, tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct object against the trees.</s> <s sid="51" id="jane.c12.s51">It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash -- a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head:  it passed me, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would.</s> <s sid="52" id="jane.c12.s52">The horse followed, -- a tall steed, and on its back a rider.</s> <s sid="53" id="jane.c12.s53">The man, the human being, broke the spell at once.</s> <s sid="54" id="jane.c12.s54">Nothing ever rode the Gytrash:  it was always alone; and goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.</s> <s sid="55" id="jane.c12.s55">No Gytrash was this, -- only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.</s> <s sid="56" id="jane.c12.s56">He passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned:  a sliding sound and an exclamation of <qs/>"What the deuce is to do now?"<qe/> and a clattering tumble, arrested my attention.</s> <s sid="57" id="jane.c12.s57">Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.</s> <s sid="58" id="jane.c12.s58">The dog came bounding back, and seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to his magnitude.</s> <s sid="59" id="jane.c12.s59">He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up to me; it was all he could do, -- there was no other help at hand to summon.</s> <s sid="60" id="jane.c12.s60">I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time struggling himself free of his steed.</s> <s sid="61" id="jane.c12.s61">His efforts were so vigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question -</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="jane.c14.p2"><s sid="4" id="jane.c14.s4">During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability.</s> <s sid="5" id="jane.c14.s5">His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="jane.c14.p3"><s sid="6" id="jane.c14.s6">One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents:  the gentlemen went away early, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.</s> <s sid="7" id="jane.c14.s7">Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and Adele were to go downstairs.</s> <s sid="8" id="jane.c14.s8">I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat, and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where there was nothing to retouch -- all being too close and plain, braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement -- we descended, Adele wondering whether the petit coffre was at length come; for, owing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.</s> <s sid="9" id="jane.c14.s9">She was gratified:  there it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.</s> <s sid="10" id="jane.c14.s10">She appeared to know it by instinct.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="jane.c16.p2" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="jane.c16.s4">But the morning passed just as usual:  nothing happened to interrupt the quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's voice, and Leah's, and the cook's -- that is, John's wife -- and even John's own gruff tones.</s> <s sid="5" id="jane.c16.s5">There were exclamations of <qs/>"What a mercy master was not burnt in his bed!"<qe/></s> <s sid="6" id="jane.c16.s6"><qs/>"It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at night."<qe/></s> <s sid="7" id="jane.c16.s7"><qs/>"How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the water-jug!"<qe/></s> <s sid="8" id="jane.c16.s8"><qs/>"I wonder he waked nobody!"<qe/></s> <s sid="9" id="jane.c16.s9"><qs/>"It is to be hoped he will not take cold with sleeping on the library sofa,"<qe/> &amp;c.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER XVII A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester:  ten days, and still he did not come.  Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent, and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.  When I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the heart.  I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles, I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder -- how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr. Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital interest.  Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority:  on the contrary, I just said -</title>

<title>CHAPTER XXIX The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very dim in my mind.  I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.  I knew I was in a small room and in a narrow bed.  To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been almost to kill me.  I took no note of the lapse of time -- of the change from morning to noon, from noon to evening.  I observed when any one entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.  Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.  Her coming disturbed me.  I had a feeling that she wished me away:  that she did not understand me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.  Diana and Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.  They would whisper sentences of this sort at my bedside -</title>

<p pid="2" id="jane.c32.p2" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="jane.c32.s15">I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.</s> <s sid="16" id="jane.c32.s16">Whenever I went out, I heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly smiles.</s> <s sid="17" id="jane.c32.s17">To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of working people, is like <qs/>"sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;"<qe/> serene inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.</s> <s sid="18" id="jane.c32.s18">At this period of my life, my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:  and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful existence -- after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars, an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone -- I used to rush into strange dreams at night:  dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the stormy -- dreams where, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye, touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him -- the hope of passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first force and fire.</s> <s sid="19" id="jane.c32.s19">Then I awoke.</s> <s sid="20" id="jane.c32.s20">Then I recalled where I was, and how situated.</s> <s sid="21" id="jane.c32.s21">Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering; and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and heard the burst of passion.</s> <s sid="22" id="jane.c32.s22">By nine o'clock the next morning I was punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady duties of the day.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="jane.c32.p3"><s sid="23" id="jane.c32.s23">Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.</s> <s sid="24" id="jane.c32.s24">Her call at the school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.</s> <s sid="25" id="jane.c32.s25">She would canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.</s> <s sid="26" id="jane.c32.s26">Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be imagined:  and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children.</s> <s sid="27" id="jane.c32.s27">She generally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising lesson.</s> <s sid="28" id="jane.c32.s28">Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young pastor's heart.</s> <s sid="29" id="jane.c32.s29">A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance, even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble- seeming features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="jane.c32.p4" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="jane.c32.s30">Of course, she knew her power:  indeed, he did not, because he could not, conceal it from her.</s> <s sid="31" id="jane.c32.s31">In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.</s> <s sid="32" id="jane.c32.s32">He seemed to say, with his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, <qs/>"I love you, and I know you prefer me.</s> <s sid="33" id="jane.c32.s33">It is not despair of success that keeps me dumb.</s> <s sid="34" id="jane.c32.s34">If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.</s> <s sid="35" id="jane.c32.s35">But that heart is already laid on a sacred altar:  the fire is arranged round it.</s> <s sid="36" id="jane.c32.s36">It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="jane.c32.p5"><s sid="37" id="jane.c32.s37">And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic and so martyr-like.</s> <s sid="38" id="jane.c32.s38">St.</s> <s sid="39" id="jane.c32.s39">John, no doubt, would have given the world to follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise.</s> <s sid="40" id="jane.c32.s40">Besides, he could not bind all that he had in his nature -- the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest -- in the limits of a single passion.</s> <s sid="41" id="jane.c32.s41">He could not -- he would not -- renounce his wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale Hall.</s> <s sid="42" id="jane.c32.s42">I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="jane.c32.p6"><s sid="43" id="jane.c32.s43">Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.</s> <s sid="44" id="jane.c32.s44">I had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:  she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly selfish.</s> <s sid="45" id="jane.c32.s45">She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely spoilt.</s> <s sid="46" id="jane.c32.s46">She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it, when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness), but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth; ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking:  she was very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me; but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.</s> <s sid="47" id="jane.c32.s47">A very different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters of St.</s> <s sid="48" id="jane.c32.s48">John.</s> <s sid="49" id="jane.c32.s49">Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult acquaintance.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="jane.c32.p7" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="jane.c32.s50">She had taken an amiable caprice to me.</s> <s sid="51" id="jane.c32.s51">She said I was like Mr. Rivers, only, certainly, she allowed, <qs/>"not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel."<qe/></s> <s sid="52" id="jane.c32.s52">I was, however, good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.</s> <s sid="53" id="jane.c32.s53">I was a lusus naturae, she affirmed, as a village schoolmistress:  she was sure my previous history, if known, would make a delightful romance.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="jane.c32.p8"><s sid="54" id="jane.c32.s54">One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.</s> <s sid="55" id="jane.c32.s55">She was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="jane.c32.p9" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="jane.c32.s56"><qs/>"Had I done these pictures?</s> <s sid="57" id="jane.c32.s57">Did I know French and German?</s> <s sid="58" id="jane.c32.s58">What a love -- what a miracle I was!</s> <s sid="59" id="jane.c32.s59">I drew better than her master in the first school in S-.</s> <s sid="60" id="jane.c32.s60">Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="jane.c32.p10" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="jane.c32.s61"><qs/>"With pleasure,"<qe/> I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.</s> <s sid="62" id="jane.c32.s62">She had then on a dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the wild grace of natural curls.</s> <s sid="63" id="jane.c32.s63">I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew a careful outline.</s> <s sid="64" id="jane.c32.s64">I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and, as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another day.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="jane.c32.p11"><s sid="65" id="jane.c32.s65">She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself accompanied her next evening -- a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright flower near a hoary turret.</s> <s sid="66" id="jane.c32.s66">He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud personage; but he was very kind to me.</s> <s sid="67" id="jane.c32.s67">The sketch of Rosamond's portrait pleased him highly:  he said I must make a finished picture of it.</s> <s sid="68" id="jane.c32.s68">He insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale Hall.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="jane.c32.p12"><s sid="69" id="jane.c32.s69">I went.</s> <s sid="70" id="jane.c32.s70">I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant evidences of wealth in the proprietor.</s> <s sid="71" id="jane.c32.s71">Rosamond was full of glee and pleasure all the time I stayed.</s> <s sid="72" id="jane.c32.s72">Her father was affable; and when he entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he only feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and would soon quit it for one more suitable.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="jane.c32.p13" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="jane.c32.s73"><qs/>"Indeed,"<qe/><sss/> cried Rosamond, <sse/><qs/>"she is clever enough to be a governess in a high family, papa."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="jane.c32.p14"><s sid="74" id="jane.c32.s74">I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the land.</s> <s sid="75" id="jane.c32.s75">Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers -- of the Rivers family -- with great respect.</s> <s sid="76" id="jane.c32.s76">He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might, if he liked, make an alliance with the best.</s> <s sid="77" id="jane.c32.s77">He accounted it a pity that so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.</s> <s sid="78" id="jane.c32.s78">It appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of Rosamond's union with St.</s> <s sid="79" id="jane.c32.s79">John.</s> <s sid="80" id="jane.c32.s80">Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="jane.c32.p15"><s sid="81" id="jane.c32.s81">It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.</s> <s sid="82" id="jane.c32.s82">My little servant, after helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a penny for her aid.</s> <s sid="83" id="jane.c32.s83">All about me was spotless and bright -- scoured floor, polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.</s> <s sid="84" id="jane.c32.s84">I had also made myself neat, and had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="jane.c32.p16"><s sid="85" id="jane.c32.s85">The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.</s> <s sid="86" id="jane.c32.s86">The head was finished already:  there was but the background to tint and the drapery to shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips -- a soft curl here and there to the tresses -- a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash under the azured eyelid.</s> <s sid="87" id="jane.c32.s87">I was absorbed in the execution of these nice details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St.</s> <s sid="88" id="jane.c32.s88">John Rivers.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="jane.c32.p18"><s sid="104" id="jane.c32.s104">While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for "Marmion" it was), St.</s> <s sid="105" id="jane.c32.s105">John stooped to examine my drawing.</s> <s sid="106" id="jane.c32.s106">His tall figure sprang erect again with a start:  he said nothing.</s> <s sid="107" id="jane.c32.s107">I looked up at him:  he shunned my eye.</s> <s sid="108" id="jane.c32.s108">I knew his thoughts well, and could read his heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he:</s> <s sid="109" id="jane.c32.s109">I had then temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do him some good, if I could.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="jane.c32.p19" type="speech"><s sid="110" id="jane.c32.s110"><qs/>"With all his firmness and self-control,"<qe/><sss/> thought I, <sse/><qs/>"he tasks himself too far:  locks every feeling and pang within -- expresses, confesses, imparts nothing.</s> <s sid="111" id="jane.c32.s111">I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry:</s> <s sid="112" id="jane.c32.s112">I will make him talk."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="jane.c32.p20" type="speech"><s sid="113" id="jane.c32.s113">I said first, <qs/>"Take a chair, Mr. Rivers."<qe/></s> <s sid="114" id="jane.c32.s114">But he answered, as he always did, that he could not stay.</s> <s sid="115" id="jane.c32.s115"><qs/>"Very well,"<qe/><sss/> I responded, mentally, <sse/><qs/>"stand if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined:  solitude is at least as bad for you as it is for me.</s> <s sid="116" id="jane.c32.s116">I'll try if I cannot discover the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="jane.c37.p1"><s sid="1" id="jane.c37.s1">The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity, moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.</s> <s sid="2" id="jane.c37.s2">I had heard of it before.</s> <s sid="3" id="jane.c37.s3">Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes went there.</s> <s sid="4" id="jane.c37.s4">His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game covers.</s> <s sid="5" id="jane.c37.s5">He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.</s> <s sid="6" id="jane.c37.s6">Ferndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went there in the season to shoot.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="jane.c37.p2"><s sid="7" id="jane.c37.s7">To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating rain.</s> <s sid="8" id="jane.c37.s8">The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and driver with the double remuneration I had promised.</s> <s sid="9" id="jane.c37.s9">Even when within a very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.</s> <s sid="10" id="jane.c37.s10">Iron gates between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.</s> <s sid="11" id="jane.c37.s11">There was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches.</s> <s sid="12" id="jane.c37.s12">I followed it, expecting soon to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it would far and farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="jane.c37.p3"><s sid="13" id="jane.c37.s13">I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.</s> <s sid="14" id="jane.c37.s14">The darkness of natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.</s> <s sid="15" id="jane.c37.s15">I looked round in search of another road.</s> <s sid="16" id="jane.c37.s16">There was none:  all was interwoven stem, columnar trunk, dense summer foliage -- no opening anywhere.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="jane.c37.p4" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="jane.c37.s17">I proceeded:  at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I beheld a railing, then the house -- scarce, by this dim light, distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls.</s> <s sid="18" id="jane.c37.s18">Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.</s> <s sid="19" id="jane.c37.s19">There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.</s> <s sid="20" id="jane.c37.s20">The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and narrow:  the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.</s> <s sid="21" id="jane.c37.s21">The whole looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, <qs/>"quite a desolate spot."<qe/></s> <s sid="22" id="jane.c37.s22">It was as still as a church on a week-day:  the pattering rain on the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="jane.c37.p5" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="jane.c37.s23"><qs/>"Can there be life here?"<qe/></s> <s sid="24" id="jane.c37.s24">I asked.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="jane.c37.p6"><s sid="25" id="jane.c37.s25">Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement -- that narrow front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the grange.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="jane.c37.p7"><s sid="26" id="jane.c37.s26">It opened slowly:  a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the step; a man without a hat:  he stretched forth his hand as if to feel whether it rained.</s> <s sid="27" id="jane.c37.s27">Dusk as it was, I had recognised him -- it was my master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="jane.c37.p8"><s sid="28" id="jane.c37.s28">I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him -- to examine him, myself unseen, and alas!  to him invisible.</s> <s sid="29" id="jane.c37.s29">It was a sudden meeting, and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.</s> <s sid="30" id="jane.c37.s30">I had no difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty advance.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="jane.c37.p9"><s sid="31" id="jane.c37.s31">His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever:  his port was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features altered or sunk:  not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.</s> <s sid="32" id="jane.c37.s32">But in his countenance I saw a change:  that looked desperate and brooding -- that reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to approach in his sullen woe.</s> <s sid="33" id="jane.c37.s33">The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="jane.c37.p10"><s sid="34" id="jane.c37.s34">And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?</s> <s sid="35" id="jane.c37.s35">-- if you do, you little know me.</s> <s sid="36" id="jane.c37.s36">A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly sealed beneath it:  but not yet.</s> <s sid="37" id="jane.c37.s37">I would not accost him yet.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="jane.c37.p11"><s sid="38" id="jane.c37.s38">He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the grass-plat.</s> <s sid="39" id="jane.c37.s39">Where was his daring stride now?</s> <s sid="40" id="jane.c37.s40">Then he paused, as if he knew not which way to turn.</s> <s sid="41" id="jane.c37.s41">He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids; gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the amphitheatre of trees:  one saw that all to him was void darkness.</s> <s sid="42" id="jane.c37.s42">He stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay around him:  he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off where he stood.</s> <s sid="43" id="jane.c37.s43">He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.</s> <s sid="44" id="jane.c37.s44">At this moment John approached him from some quarter.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="jane.c37.p12" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="jane.c37.s45"><qs/>"Will you take my arm, sir?"<qe/><sss/>  he said; <sse/><qs/>"there is a heavy shower coming on:  had you not better go in?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="jane.c37.p13" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="jane.c37.s46"><qs/>"Let me alone,"<qe/> was the answer.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="jane.c37.p14"><s sid="47" id="jane.c37.s47">John withdrew without having observed me.</s> <s sid="48" id="jane.c37.s48">Mr. Rochester now tried to walk about:  vainly, -- all was too uncertain.</s> <s sid="49" id="jane.c37.s49">He groped his way back to the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="jane.c37.p15" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="jane.c37.s50">I now drew near and knocked:</s> <s sid="51" id="jane.c37.s51">John's wife opened for me.</s> <s sid="52" id="jane.c37.s52"><qs/>"Mary,"<qe/><sss/> I said, <sse/><qs/>"how are you?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="jane.c37.p16" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="jane.c37.s53">She started as if she had seen a ghost:</s> <s sid="54" id="jane.c37.s54">I calmed her.</s> <s sid="55" id="jane.c37.s55">To her hurried <qs/>"Is it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?"<qe/></s> <s sid="56" id="jane.c37.s56">I answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen, where John now sat by a good fire.</s> <s sid="57" id="jane.c37.s57">I explained to them, in few words, that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that I was come to see Mr. Rochester.</s> <s sid="58" id="jane.c37.s58">I asked John to go down to the turn-pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I had left there:  and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.</s> <s sid="59" id="jane.c37.s59">Just at this moment the parlour-bell rang.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="jane.c37.p17" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="jane.c37.s60"><qs/>"When you go in,"<qe/><sss/> said I, <sse/><qs/>"tell your master that a person wishes to speak to him, but do not give my name."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="jane.c37.p18" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="jane.c37.s61"><qs/>"I don't think he will see you,"<qe/><sss/> she answered; <sse/><qs/>"he refuses everybody."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="jane.c37.p19" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="jane.c37.s62">When she returned, I inquired what he had said.</s> <s sid="63" id="jane.c37.s63"><qs/>"You are to send in your name and your business,"<qe/> she replied.</s> <s sid="64" id="jane.c37.s64">She then proceeded to fill a glass with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="jane.c37.p20" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="jane.c37.s65"><qs/>"Is that what he rang for?"<qe/></s> <s sid="66" id="jane.c37.s66">I asked.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="jane.c37.p21" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="jane.c37.s67"><qs/>"Yes:  he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="jane.c37.p22" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="jane.c37.s68"><qs/>"Give the tray to me; I will carry it in."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="jane.c37.p23"><s sid="69" id="jane.c37.s69">I took it from her hand:  she pointed me out the parlour door.</s> <s sid="70" id="jane.c37.s70">The tray shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my ribs loud and fast.</s> <s sid="71" id="jane.c37.s71">Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="jane.c37.p24" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="jane.c37.s72">This parlour looked gloomy:  a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high, old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.</s> <s sid="73" id="jane.c37.s73">His old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.</s> <s sid="74" id="jane.c37.s74">Pilot pricked up his ears when I came in:  then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded towards me:  he almost knocked the tray from my hands.</s> <s sid="75" id="jane.c37.s75">I set it on the table; then patted him, and said softly, <qs/>"Lie down!"<qe/></s> <s sid="76" id="jane.c37.s76">Mr. Rochester turned mechanically to SEE what the commotion was:  but as he SAW nothing, he returned and sighed.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="jane.c37.p25" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="jane.c37.s77"><qs/>"Give me the water, Mary,"<qe/> he said.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="jane.c37.p26"><s sid="78" id="jane.c37.s78">I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me, still excited.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="jane.c37.p27" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="jane.c37.s79"><qs/>"What is the matter?"<qe/>  he inquired.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="jane.c37.p29" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="jane.c37.s84"><qs/>"Mary is in the kitchen,"<qe/> I answered.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="jane.c37.p30" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="jane.c37.s85">He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood, he did not touch me.</s> <s sid="86" id="jane.c37.s86"><qs/>"Who is this?</s> <s sid="87" id="jane.c37.s87">Who is this?"<qe/>  he demanded, trying, as it seemed, to SEE with those sightless eyes -- unavailing and distressing attempt!</s> <s sid="88" id="jane.c37.s88"><qs/>"Answer me -- speak again!"<qe/> he ordered, imperiously and aloud.</s> </p>
