<title>CHAPTER I THE SQUIRE OF ALLINGTON</title>

<p pid="1" id="alli.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="alli.c1.s1">Of course there was a Great House at Allington.</s> <s sid="2" id="alli.c1.s2">How otherwise should there have been a Small House?</s> <s sid="3" id="alli.c1.s3">Our story will, as its name imports, have its closest relations with those who lived in the less dignified domicile of the two; but it will have close relations also with the more dignified, and it may be well that I should, in the first instance, say a few words as to the Great House and its owner.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="alli.c1.p2"><s sid="4" id="alli.c1.s4">The squires of Allington had been squires of Allington since squires, such as squires are now, were first known in England.</s> <s sid="5" id="alli.c1.s5">From father to son, and from uncle to nephew, and, in one instance, from second cousin to second cousin, the sceptre had descended in the family of the Dales; and the acres had remained intact, growing in value and not decreasing in number, though guarded by no entail and protected by no wonderful amount of prudence or wisdom.</s> <s sid="6" id="alli.c1.s6">The estate of Dale of Allington had been coterminous with the parish of Allington for some hundreds of years; and though, as I have said, the race of squires had possessed nothing of superhuman discretion, and had perhaps been guided in their walks through life by no very distinct principles, still there had been with them so much of adherence to a sacred law, that no acre of the property had ever been parted from the hands of the existing squire.</s> <s sid="7" id="alli.c1.s7">Some futile attempts had been made to increase the territory, as indeed had been done by Kit Dale, the father of Christopher Dale, who will appear as our squire of Allington when the persons of our drama are introduced.</s> <s sid="8" id="alli.c1.s8">Old Kit Dale, who had married money, had bought outlying farms--a bit of ground here and a bit there--talking, as he did so, much of political influence and of the good old Tory cause.</s> <s sid="9" id="alli.c1.s9">But these farms and bits of ground had gone again before our time.</s> <s sid="10" id="alli.c1.s10">To them had been attached no religion.</s> <s sid="11" id="alli.c1.s11">When old Kit had found himself pressed in that matter of the majority of the Nineteenth Dragoons, in which crack regiment his second son made for himself quite a career, he found it easier to sell than to save--seeing that that which he sold was his own and not the patrimony of the Dales.</s> <s sid="12" id="alli.c1.s12">At his death the remainder of these purchases had gone.</s> <s sid="13" id="alli.c1.s13">Family arrangements required completion, and Christopher Dale required ready money.</s> <s sid="14" id="alli.c1.s14">The outlying farms flew away, as such new purchases had flown before; but the old patrimony of the Dales remained untouched, as it had ever remained.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="alli.c1.p3"><s sid="15" id="alli.c1.s15">It had been a religion among them; and seeing that the worship had been carried on without fail, that the vestal fire had never gone down upon the hearth, I should not have said that the Dales had walked their ways without high principle.</s> <s sid="16" id="alli.c1.s16">For this religion they had all adhered, and the new heir had ever entered in upon his domain without other encumbrances than those with which he himself was then already burdened.</s> <s sid="17" id="alli.c1.s17">And yet there had been no entail.</s> <s sid="18" id="alli.c1.s18">The idea of an entail was not in accordance with the peculiarities of the Dale mind.</s> <s sid="19" id="alli.c1.s19">It was necessary to the Dale religion that each squire should have the power of wasting the acres of Allington--and that he should abstain from wasting them.</s> <s sid="20" id="alli.c1.s20">I remember to have dined at a house, the whole glory and fortune of which depended on the safety of a glass goblet.</s> <s sid="21" id="alli.c1.s21">We all know the story.</s> <s sid="22" id="alli.c1.s22">If the luck of Edenhall should be shattered, the doom of the family would be sealed.</s> <s sid="23" id="alli.c1.s23">Nevertheless I was bidden to drink out of the fatal glass, as were all guests in that house.</s> <s sid="24" id="alli.c1.s24">It would not have contented the chivalrous mind of the master to protect his doom by lock and key and padded chest.</s> <s sid="25" id="alli.c1.s25">And so it was with the Dales of Allington.</s> <s sid="26" id="alli.c1.s26">To them an entail would have been a lock and key and a padded chest; but the old chivalry of their house denied to them the use of such protection.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="alli.c1.p4"><s sid="27" id="alli.c1.s27">I have spoken something slightingly of the acquirements and doings of the family; and indeed their acquirements had been few and their doings little.</s> <s sid="28" id="alli.c1.s28">At Allington, Dale of Allington had always been known as a king.</s> <s sid="29" id="alli.c1.s29">At Guestwick, the neighbouring market town, he was a great man--to be seen frequently on Saturdays, standing in the market-place, and laying down the law as to barley and oxen among men who knew usually more about barley and oxen than did he.</s> <s sid="30" id="alli.c1.s30">At Hamersham, the assize town, he was generally in some repute, being a constant grand juror for the county, and a man who paid his way.</s> <s sid="31" id="alli.c1.s31">But even at Hamersham the glory of the Dales had, at most periods, begun to pale, for they had seldom been widely conspicuous in the county, and had earned no great reputation by their knowledge of jurisprudence in the grand jury room.</s> <s sid="32" id="alli.c1.s32">Beyond Hamersham their fame had not spread itself.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="alli.c1.p5"><s sid="33" id="alli.c1.s33">They had been men generally built in the same mould, inheriting each from his father the same virtues and the same vices--men who would have lived, each, as his father had lived before him, had not the new ways of the world gradually drawn away with them, by an invisible magnetism, the upcoming Dale of the day--not indeed in any case so moving him as to bring him up to the spirit of the age in which he lived, but dragging him forward to a line in advance of that on which his father had trodden.</s> <s sid="34" id="alli.c1.s34">They had been obstinate men; believing much in themselves; just according to their ideas of justice; hard to their tenants--but not known to be hard even by the tenants themselves, for the rules followed had ever been the rules on the Allington estate; imperious to their wives and children, but imperious within bounds, so that no Mrs Dale had fled from her lord's roof, and no loud scandals had existed between father and sons; exacting in their ideas as to money, expecting that they were to receive much and to give little, and yet not thought to be mean, for they paid their way, and gave money in parish charity and in county charity.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="alli.c1.p6"><s sid="35" id="alli.c1.s35">They had ever been steady supporters of the Church, graciously receiving into their parish such new vicars as, from time to time, were sent to them from King's College, Cambridge, to which establishment the gift of the living belonged--but, nevertheless, the Dales had ever carried on some unpronounced warfare against the clergyman, so that the intercourse between the lay family and the clerical had seldom been in all respects pleasant.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="alli.c1.p7"><s sid="36" id="alli.c1.s36">Such had been the Dales of Allington, time out of mind, and such in all respects would have been the Christopher Dale of our time, had he not suffered two accidents in his youth.</s> <s sid="37" id="alli.c1.s37">He had fallen in love with a lady--who obstinately refused his hand, and on her account he had remained single; that was his first accident.</s> <s sid="38" id="alli.c1.s38">The second had fallen upon him with reference to his father's assumed wealth.</s> <s sid="39" id="alli.c1.s39">He had supposed himself to be richer than other Dales of Allington when coming in upon his property, and had consequently entertained an idea of sitting in Parliament for his county.</s> <s sid="40" id="alli.c1.s40">In order that he might attain this honour he had allowed himself to be talked by the men of Hamersham and Guestwick out of his old family politics, and had declared himself a Liberal.</s> <s sid="41" id="alli.c1.s41">He had never gone to the poll, and, indeed, had never actually stood for the seat.</s> <s sid="42" id="alli.c1.s42">But he had come forward as a liberal politician, and had failed; and, although it was well known to all around that Christopher Dale was in heart as thoroughly conservative as any of his forefathers, this accident had made him sour and silent on the subject of politics, and had somewhat estranged him from his brother squires.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="alli.c1.p8"><s sid="43" id="alli.c1.s43">In other respects our Christopher Dale was, if anything, superior to the average of the family.</s> <s sid="44" id="alli.c1.s44">Those whom he did love he loved dearly.</s> <s sid="45" id="alli.c1.s45">Those whom he hated he did not ill-use beyond the limits of justice.</s> <s sid="46" id="alli.c1.s46">He was close in small matters of money, and yet in certain family arrangements he was, as we shall see, capable of much liberality.</s> <s sid="47" id="alli.c1.s47">He endeavoured to do his duty in accordance with his lights, and had succeeded in weaning himself from personal indulgences, to which during the early days of his high hopes he had become accustomed.</s> <s sid="48" id="alli.c1.s48">And in that matter of his unrequited love he had been true throughout.</s> <s sid="49" id="alli.c1.s49">In his hard, dry, unpleasant way he had loved the woman; and when at least he learned to know that she would not have his love, he had been unable to transfer his heart to another.</s> <s sid="50" id="alli.c1.s50">This had happened just at the period of his father's death, and he had endeavoured to console himself with politics, with what fate we have already seen.</s> <s sid="51" id="alli.c1.s51">A constant, upright, and by no means insincere man was our Christopher Dale--thin and meagre in his mental attributes, by no means even understanding the fullness of a full man, with power of eye-sight very limited in seeing aught which was above him, but yet worthy of regard in that he had realised a path of duty and did endeavour to walk therein.</s> <s sid="52" id="alli.c1.s52">And, moreover, our Mr Christopher Dale was a gentleman.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="alli.c1.p9"><s sid="53" id="alli.c1.s53">Such in character was the squire of Allington, the only regular inhabitant of the Great House.</s> <s sid="54" id="alli.c1.s54">In person, he was a plain, dry man, with short grizzled hair and thick grizzled eyebrows.</s> <s sid="55" id="alli.c1.s55">Of beard, he had very little, carrying the smallest possible grey whiskers, which hardly fell below the points of his ears.</s> <s sid="56" id="alli.c1.s56">His eyes were sharp and expressive, and his nose was straight and well formed--as was also his chin.</s> <s sid="57" id="alli.c1.s57">But the nobility of his face was destroyed by a mean mouth with thin lips; and his forehead, which was high and narrow, though it forbad you to take Mr Dale for a fool, forbad you also to take him for a man of great parts, or of a wide capacity.</s> <s sid="58" id="alli.c1.s58">In height, he was about five feet ten; and at the time of our story was as near to seventy as he was to sixty.</s> <s sid="59" id="alli.c1.s59">But years had treated him very lightly, and he bore few signs of age.</s> <s sid="60" id="alli.c1.s60">Such in person was Christopher Dale, Esq, the squire of Allington, and owner of some three thousand a year, all of which proceeded from the lands of that parish.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="alli.c1.p10"><s sid="61" id="alli.c1.s61">And now I will speak of the Great House of Allington.</s> <s sid="62" id="alli.c1.s62">After all, it was not very great; nor was it surrounded by much of that exquisite nobility of park appurtenance which graces the habitations of most of our old landed proprietors.</s> <s sid="63" id="alli.c1.s63">But the house itself was very graceful.</s> <s sid="64" id="alli.c1.s64">It had been built in the days of the early Stuarts, in that style of architecture to which we give the name of the Tudors.</s> <s sid="65" id="alli.c1.s65">On its front it showed three pointed roofs, or gables, as I believe they should be called; and between each gable a thin tall chimney stood, the two chimneys thus raising themselves just above the three peaks I have mentioned.</s> <s sid="66" id="alli.c1.s66">I think that the beauty of the house depended much on those two chimneys; on them, and on the mullioned windows with which the front of the house was closely filled.</s> <s sid="67" id="alli.c1.s67">The door, with its jutting porch, was by no means in the centre of the house.</s> <s sid="68" id="alli.c1.s68">As you entered, there was but one window on your right hand, while on your left there were three.</s> <s sid="69" id="alli.c1.s69">And over these there was a line of five windows, one taking its place above the porch.</s> <s sid="70" id="alli.c1.s70">We all know the beautiful old Tudor window, with its stout stone mullions and its stone transoms, crossing from side to side at a point much nearer to the top than to the bottom.</s> <s sid="71" id="alli.c1.s71">Of all windows ever invented it is the sweetest.</s> <s sid="72" id="alli.c1.s72">And here, at Allington, I think their beauty was enhanced by the fact that they were not regular in their shape.</s> <s sid="73" id="alli.c1.s73">Some of these windows were long windows, while some of them were high.</s> <s sid="74" id="alli.c1.s74">That to the right of the door, and that at the other extremity of the house, were among the former.</s> <s sid="75" id="alli.c1.s75">But the others had been put in without regard to uniformity, a long window here, and a high window there, with a general effect which could hardly have been improved.</s> <s sid="76" id="alli.c1.s76">Then above, in the three gables, were three other smaller apertures.</s> <s sid="77" id="alli.c1.s77">But these also were mullioned, and the entire frontage of the house was uniform in its style.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="alli.c1.p11"><s sid="78" id="alli.c1.s78">Round the house there were trim gardens, not very large, but worthy of much note in that they were so trim--gardens with broad gravel paths, with one walk running in front of the house so broad as to be fitly called a terrace.</s> <s sid="79" id="alli.c1.s79">But this, though in front of the house, was sufficiently removed from it to allow of a coach-road running inside it to the front door.</s> <s sid="80" id="alli.c1.s80">The Dales of Allington had always been gardeners, and their garden was perhaps more noted in the county than any other of their properties.</s> <s sid="81" id="alli.c1.s81">But outside the gardens no pretensions had been made to the grandeur of a domain.</s> <s sid="82" id="alli.c1.s82">The pastures round the house were but pretty fields, in which timber was abundant.</s> <s sid="83" id="alli.c1.s83">There was no deer-park at Allington; and though the Allington woods were well known, they formed no portion of a whole of which the house was a part.</s> <s sid="84" id="alli.c1.s84">They lay away, out of sight, a full mile from the back of the house; but not on that account of less avail for the fitting preservation of foxes.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="alli.c1.p12"><s sid="85" id="alli.c1.s85">And the house stood much too near the road for purposes of grandeur, had such purposes ever swelled the breast of any of the squires of Allington.</s> <s sid="86" id="alli.c1.s86">But I fancy that our ideas of rural grandeur have altered since many of our older country seats were built.</s> <s sid="87" id="alli.c1.s87">To be near the village, so as in some way to afford comfort, protection, and patronage, and perhaps also with some view to the pleasantness of neighbourhood for its own inmates, seemed to be the object of a gentleman when building his house in the old days.</s> <s sid="88" id="alli.c1.s88">A solitude in the centre of a wide park is now the only site that can be recognised as eligible.</s> <s sid="89" id="alli.c1.s89">No cottage must be seen, unless the cottage _orne_ of the gardener.</s> <s sid="90" id="alli.c1.s90">The village, if it cannot be abolished, must be got out of sight.</s> <s sid="91" id="alli.c1.s91">The sound of the church bells is not desirable, and the road on which the profane vulgar travel by their own right must be at a distance.</s> <s sid="92" id="alli.c1.s92">When some old Dale of Allington built his house, he thought differently.</s> <s sid="93" id="alli.c1.s93">There stood the church and there the village, and, pleased with such vicinity, he sat himself down close to his God and to his tenants.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="alli.c1.p13"><s sid="94" id="alli.c1.s94">As you pass along the road from Guestwick into the village you see the church near to you on your left hand; but the house is hidden from the road.</s> <s sid="95" id="alli.c1.s95">As you approach the church, reaching the gate of it which is not above two hundred yards from the high road, you see the full front of the Great House.</s> <s sid="96" id="alli.c1.s96">Perhaps the best view of it is from the churchyard.</s> <s sid="97" id="alli.c1.s97">The lane leading up to the church ends in a gate, which is the entrance into Mr Dale's place.</s> <s sid="98" id="alli.c1.s98">There is no lodge there, and the gate generally stands open--indeed, always does so, unless some need of cattle grazing within requires that it should be closed.</s> <s sid="99" id="alli.c1.s99">But there is an inner gate, leading from the home paddock through the gardens to the house, and another inner gate, some thirty yards farther on, which will take you into the farmyard.</s> <s sid="100" id="alli.c1.s100">Perhaps it is a defect at Allington that the farmyard is very close to the house.</s> <s sid="101" id="alli.c1.s101">But the stables, and the straw-yards, and the unwashed carts, and the lazy lingering cattle of the homestead, are screened off by a row of chestnuts, which, when in its glory of flower, in the early days of May, no other row in England can surpass in beauty.</s> <s sid="102" id="alli.c1.s102">Had any one told Dale of Allington--this Dale or any former Dale--that his place wanted wood, he would have pointed with mingled pride and disdain to his belt of chestnuts.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="alli.c1.p14"><s sid="103" id="alli.c1.s103">Of the church itself I will say the fewest possible number of words.</s> <s sid="104" id="alli.c1.s104">It was a church such as there are, I think, thousands in England--low, incommodious, kept with difficulty in repair, too often pervious to the wet, and yet strangely picturesque, and correct too, according to great rules of architecture.</s> <s sid="105" id="alli.c1.s105">It was built with a nave and aisles, visibly in the form of a cross, though with its arms clipped down to the trunk, with a separate chancel, with a large square short tower, and with a bell-shaped spire, covered with lead and irregular in its proportions.</s> <s sid="106" id="alli.c1.s106">Who does not know the low porch, the perpendicular Gothic window, the flat-roofed aisles, and the noble old grey tower of such a church as this?</s> <s sid="107" id="alli.c1.s107">As regards its interior, it was dusty; it was blocked up with high-backed ugly pews; the gallery in which the children sat at the end of the church, and in which two ancient musicians blew their bassoons, was all awry, and looked as though it would fall; the pulpit was an ugly useless edifice, as high nearly as the roof would allow, and the reading-desk under it hardly permitted the parson to keep his head free from the dangling tassels of the cushion above him.</s> <s sid="108" id="alli.c1.s108">A clerk also was there beneath him, holding a third position somewhat elevated; and upon the whole thing there were not quite as I would have had them.</s> <s sid="109" id="alli.c1.s109">But, nevertheless, the place looked like a church, and I can hardly say so much for all the modern edifices which have been built in my days towards the glory of God.</s> <s sid="110" id="alli.c1.s110">It looked like a church, and not the less so because in walking up the passage between the pews the visitor trod upon the brass plates which dignified the resting-places of the departed Dales of old.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="alli.c1.p15"><s sid="111" id="alli.c1.s111">Below the church, and between that and the village, stood the vicarage, in such position that the small garden of the vicarage stretched from the churchyard down to the backs of the village cottages.</s> <s sid="112" id="alli.c1.s112">This was a pleasant residence, newly built within the last thirty years, and creditable to the ideas of comfort entertained by the rich collegiate body from which the vicars of Allington always came.</s> <s sid="113" id="alli.c1.s113">Doubtless we shall in the course of our sojourn at Allington visit the vicarage now and then, but I do not know that any farther detailed account of its comforts will be necessary to us.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="alli.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="114" id="alli.c1.s114">Passing by the lane leading to the vicarage, the church, and to the house, the high road descends rapidly to a little brook which runs through the village.</s> <s sid="115" id="alli.c1.s115">On the right as you descend you will have seen the <qs/>"Red Lion,"<qe/> and will have seen no other house conspicuous in any way.</s> <s sid="116" id="alli.c1.s116">At the bottom, close to the brook, is the post-office, kept surely by the crossest old woman in all those parts.</s> <s sid="117" id="alli.c1.s117">Here the road passes through the water, the accommodation of a narrow wooden bridge having been afforded for those on foot.</s> <s sid="118" id="alli.c1.s118">But before passing the stream, you will see a cross street, running to the left, as had run that other lane leading to the house.</s> <s sid="119" id="alli.c1.s119">Here, as this cross street rises the hill, are the best houses in the village.</s> <s sid="120" id="alli.c1.s120">The baker lives here, and that respectable woman, Mrs Frummage, who sells ribbons, and toys, and soap, and straw bonnets, with many other things too long to mention.</s> <s sid="121" id="alli.c1.s121">Here, too, lives an apothecary, whom the veneration of this and neighbouring parishes has raised to the dignity of a doctor.</s> <s sid="122" id="alli.c1.s122">And here also, in the smallest but prettiest cottage that can be imagined, lives Mrs Hearn, the widow of a former vicar, on terms, however, with her neighbour the squire which I regret to say are not as friendly as they should be.</s> <s sid="123" id="alli.c1.s123">Beyond this lady's modest residence, Allington Street, for so the road is called, turns suddenly round towards the church, and at the point of the turn is a pretty low iron railing with a gate, and with a covered way, which leads up to the front door of the house which stands there, I will only say here, at this fag end of a chapter, that it is the Small House at Allington.</s> <s sid="124" id="alli.c1.s124">Allington Street, as I have said, turns short round towards the church at this point, and there ends at a white gate, leading into the churchyard by a second entrance.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="alli.c1.p17"><s sid="125" id="alli.c1.s125">So much it was needful that I should say of Allington Great House, of the Squire, and of the village.</s> <s sid="126" id="alli.c1.s126">Of the Small House, I will speak separately in a further chapter.</s> </p></div>

<title>CHAPTER III THE WIDOW DALE OF ALLINGTON</title>

<p pid="1" id="alli.c3.p1"><s sid="1" id="alli.c3.s1">As Mrs Dale, of the Small House, was not a Dale by birth, there can be no necessity for insisting on the fact that none of the Dale peculiarities should be sought for in her character.</s> <s sid="2" id="alli.c3.s2">These peculiarities were not, perhaps, very conspicuous in her daughters, who had taken more in that respect from their mother than from their father; but a close observer might recognise the girls as Dales.</s> <s sid="3" id="alli.c3.s3">They were constant, perhaps obstinate, occasionally a little uncharitable in their judgment, and prone to think that there was a great deal in being a Dale, though not prone to say much about it.</s> <s sid="4" id="alli.c3.s4">But they had also a better pride than this, which had come to them as their mother's heritage.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="alli.c3.p2"><s sid="5" id="alli.c3.s5">Mrs Dale was certainly a proud woman--not that there was anything appertaining to herself in which she took a pride.</s> <s sid="6" id="alli.c3.s6">In birth she had been much lower than her husband, seeing that her grandfather had been almost nobody.</s> <s sid="7" id="alli.c3.s7">Her fortune had been considerable for her rank in life, and on its proceeds she now mainly depended; but it had not been sufficient to give any of the pride of wealth.</s> <s sid="8" id="alli.c3.s8">And she had been a beauty; according to my taste, was still very lovely; but certainly at this time of life, she, a widow of fifteen years' standing, with two grown-up daughters, took no pride in her beauty.</s> <s sid="9" id="alli.c3.s9">Nor had she any conscious pride in the fact that she was a lady.</s> <s sid="10" id="alli.c3.s10">That she was a lady, inwards and outwards, from the crown of her head to the sole of her feet, in head, in heart, and in mind, a lady by education and a lady by nature, a lady also by birth in spite of that deficiency respecting her grandfather, I hereby state as a fact--mea periculo.</s> <s sid="11" id="alli.c3.s11">And the squire, though he had no special love for her, had recognised this, and in all respects treated her as his equal.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER IV MRS ROPER'S BOARDING-HOUSE</title>

<p pid="1" id="alli.c4.p1"><s sid="1" id="alli.c4.s1">I have said that John Eames had been petted by none but his mother, but I would not have it supposed, on this account, that John Eames had no friends.</s> <s sid="2" id="alli.c4.s2">There is a class of young men who never get petted, though they may not be the less esteemed, or perhaps loved.</s> <s sid="3" id="alli.c4.s3">They do not come forth to the world as Apollos, nor shine at all, keeping what light they may have for inward purposes.</s> <s sid="4" id="alli.c4.s4">Such young men are often awkward, ungainly, and not yet formed in their gait; they straggle with their limbs, and are shy; words do not come to them with ease, when words are required, among any but their accustomed associates.</s> <s sid="5" id="alli.c4.s5">Social meetings are periods of penance to them, and any appearance in public will unnerve them.</s> <s sid="6" id="alli.c4.s6">They go much about alone, and blush when women speak to them.</s> <s sid="7" id="alli.c4.s7">In truth, they are not as yet men, whatever the number may be of their years; and, as they are no longer boys, the world has found for them the ungraceful name of hobbledehoy.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="alli.c4.p2"><s sid="8" id="alli.c4.s8">Such observations, however, as I have been enabled to make in this matter have led me to believe that the hobbledehoy is by no means the least valuable species of the human race.</s> <s sid="9" id="alli.c4.s9">When I compare the hobbledehoy of one or two and twenty to some finished Apollo of the same age, I regard the former as unripe fruit, and the latter as fruit that is ripe.</s> <s sid="10" id="alli.c4.s10">Then comes the question as to the two fruits.</s> <s sid="11" id="alli.c4.s11">Which is the better fruit, that which ripens early--which is, perhaps, favoured with some little forcing apparatus, or which, at least, is backed by the warmth of a southern wall; or that fruit of slower growth, as to which nature works without assistance, on which the sun operates in its own time--or perhaps never operates if some ungenial shade has been allowed to interpose itself?</s> <s sid="12" id="alli.c4.s12">The world, no doubt, is in favour of the forcing apparatus or of the southern wall.</s> <s sid="13" id="alli.c4.s13">The fruit comes certainly, and at an assured period.</s> <s sid="14" id="alli.c4.s14">It is spotless, speck-less, and of a certain quality by no means despicable.</s> <s sid="15" id="alli.c4.s15">The owner has it when he wants it, and it serves its turn.</s> <s sid="16" id="alli.c4.s16">But, nevertheless, according to my thinking, the fullest flavour of the sun is given to that other fruit--is given in the sun's own good time, if so be that no ungenial shade has interposed itself.</s> <s sid="17" id="alli.c4.s17">I like the smack of the natural growth, and like it, perhaps, the better because that which has been obtained has been obtained without favour.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="alli.c4.p3"><s sid="18" id="alli.c4.s18">But the hobbledehoy, though he blushes when women address him, and is uneasy even when he is near them, though he is not master of his limbs in a ball-room, and is hardly master of his tongue at any time, is the most eloquent of beings, and especially eloquent among beautiful women.</s> <s sid="19" id="alli.c4.s19">He enjoys all the triumphs of a Don Juan, without any of Don Juan's heartlessness, and is able to conquer in all encounters, through the force of his wit and the sweetness of his voice.</s> <s sid="20" id="alli.c4.s20">But this eloquence is heard only by his own inner ears, and these triumphs are the triumphs of his imagination.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="alli.c4.p4"><s sid="21" id="alli.c4.s21">The true hobbledehoy is much alone, not being greatly given to social intercourse even with other hohbledehoys--a trait in his character which I think has hardly been sufficiently observed by the world at large.</s> <s sid="22" id="alli.c4.s22">He has probably become a hobbledehoy instead of an Apollo, because circumstances have not afforded him much social intercourse; and, therefore, he wanders about in solitude, taking long walks, in which he dreams of those successes which are so far removed from his powers of achievement.</s> <s sid="23" id="alli.c4.s23">Out in the fields, with his stick in his hand, he is very eloquent, cutting off the heads of the springing summer weeds, as he practises his oratory with energy.</s> <s sid="24" id="alli.c4.s24">And thus he feeds an imagination for which those who know him give him but scanty credit, and unconsciously prepares himself for that latter ripening, if only the ungenial shade will some day cease to interpose itself.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="alli.c4.p5"><s sid="25" id="alli.c4.s25">Such hobbledehoys receive but little petting, unless it be from a mother; and such a hobbledehoy was John Eames when he was sent away from Guestwick to begin his life in the big room of a public office in London.</s> <s sid="26" id="alli.c4.s26">We may say that there was nothing of the young Apollo about him.</s> <s sid="27" id="alli.c4.s27">But yet he was not without friends--friends who wished him well, and thought much of his welfare.</s> <s sid="28" id="alli.c4.s28">And he had a younger sister who loved him dearly, who had no idea that he was a hobbledehoy, being somewhat of a hobbledehoy herself.</s> <s sid="29" id="alli.c4.s29">Mrs Eames, their mother, was a widow, living in a small house in Guestwick, whose husband had been throughout his whole life an intimate friend of our squire.</s> <s sid="30" id="alli.c4.s30">He had been a man of many misfortunes, having begun the world almost with affluence, and having ended it in poverty.</s> <s sid="31" id="alli.c4.s31">He had lived all his days in Guestwick, having at one time occupied a large tract of land, and lost much money in experimental farming; and late in life he had taken a small house on the outskirts of the town, and there had died, some two years previously to the commencement of this story.</s> <s sid="32" id="alli.c4.s32">With no other man had Mr Dale lived on terms so intimate; and when Mr Eames died Mr Dale acted as executor under his will, and as guardian to his children.</s> <s sid="33" id="alli.c4.s33">He had, moreover, obtained for John Eames that situation under the Crown which he now held.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="alli.c4.p6"><s sid="34" id="alli.c4.s34">And Mrs Eames had been and still was on very friendly terms with Mrs Dale.</s> <s sid="35" id="alli.c4.s35">The squire had never taken quite kindly to Mrs Eames, whom her husband had not met till he was already past forty years of age.</s> <s sid="36" id="alli.c4.s36">But Mrs Dale had made up by her kindness to the poor forlorn woman for any lack of that cordiality which might have been shown to her from the Great House.</s> <s sid="37" id="alli.c4.s37">Mrs Eames was a poor forlorn woman--forlorn even during the time of her husband's life, but very woebegone now in her widowhood.</s> <s sid="38" id="alli.c4.s38">In matters of importance the squire had been kind to her; arranging for her little money affairs, advising her about her house and income, also getting for her that appointment for her son.</s> <s sid="39" id="alli.c4.s39">But he snubbed her when he met her, and poor Mrs Eames held him in great awe.</s> <s sid="40" id="alli.c4.s40">Mrs Dale held her brother-in-law in no awe, and sometimes gave to the widow from Guestwick advice quite at variance to that given by the squire.</s> <s sid="41" id="alli.c4.s41">In this way there had grown up an intimacy between Bell and Lily and the young Eames, and either of the girls was prepared to declare that Johnny Eames was her own and well-loved friend.</s> <s sid="42" id="alli.c4.s42">Nevertheless, they spoke of him occasionally with some little dash of merriment--as is not unusual with pretty girls who have hobbledehoys among their intimate friends, and who are not themselves unaccustomed to the grace of an Apollo.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="alli.c4.p7"><s sid="43" id="alli.c4.s43">I may as well announce at once that John Eames, when he went up to London, was absolutely and irretrievably in love with Lily Dale.</s> <s sid="44" id="alli.c4.s44">He had declared his passion in the most moving language a hundred times; but he had declared it only to himself.</s> <s sid="45" id="alli.c4.s45">He had written much poetry about Lily, but he kept his lines safe under double lock and key.</s> <s sid="46" id="alli.c4.s46">When he gave the reins to his imagination, he flattered himself that he might win not only her but the world at large also by his verses; but he would have perished rather than exhibit them to human eye.</s> <s sid="47" id="alli.c4.s47">During the last ten weeks of his life at Guestwick, while he was preparing for his career in London, he hung about Allington, walking over frequently and then walking back again; but all in vain.</s> <s sid="48" id="alli.c4.s48">During these visits he would sit in Mrs Dale's drawing-room, speaking but little, and addressing himself usually to the mother; but on each occasion, as he started on his long, hot walk, he resolved that he would say something by which Lily might know of his love.</s> <s sid="49" id="alli.c4.s49">When he left for London that something had not been said.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="alli.c4.p8"><s sid="50" id="alli.c4.s50">He had not dreamed of asking her to be his wife.</s> <s sid="51" id="alli.c4.s51">John Eames was about to begin the world with eighty pounds a year, and an allowance of twenty more from his mother's purse.</s> <s sid="52" id="alli.c4.s52">He was well aware that with such an income he could not establish himself as a married man in London, and he also felt that the man who might be fortunate enough to win Lily for his wife should be prepared to give her every soft luxury that the world could afford.</s> <s sid="53" id="alli.c4.s53">He knew well that he ought not to expect any assurance of Lily's love; but, nevertheless, he thought it possible that he might give her an assurance of his love.</s> <s sid="54" id="alli.c4.s54">It would probably be in vain.</s> <s sid="55" id="alli.c4.s55">He had no real hope, unless when he was in one of those poetic moods.</s> <s sid="56" id="alli.c4.s56">He had acknowledged to himself, in some indistinct way, that he was no more than a hobbledehoy, awkward, silent, ungainly, with a face unfinished, as it were, or unripe.</s> <s sid="57" id="alli.c4.s57">All this he knew, and knew also that there were Apollos in the world who would be only too ready to carry off Lily in their splendid cars.</s> <s sid="58" id="alli.c4.s58">But not the less did he make up his mind that having loved her once, it behoved him, as a true man, to love her on to the end.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="alli.c4.p9"><s sid="59" id="alli.c4.s59">One little word he had said to her when they parted, but it had been a word of friendship rather than of love.</s> <s sid="60" id="alli.c4.s60">He had strayed out after her on to the lawn, leaving Bell alone in the drawing-room.</s> <s sid="61" id="alli.c4.s61">Perhaps Lily had understood something of the boy's feelings, and had wished to speak kindly to him at parting, or almost more than kindly.</s> <s sid="62" id="alli.c4.s62">There is a silent love which women recognise, and which in some silent way they acknowledge--giving gracious but silent thanks for the respect which accompanies it."</s> <s sid="63" id="alli.c4.s63">I have come to say good-bye, Lily," said Johnny Eames, following the girl down one of the paths.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="alli.c4.p10" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="alli.c4.s64"><qs/>"Good-bye, John,"<qe/> said she, turning round.</s> <s sid="65" id="alli.c4.s65"><qs/>"You know how sorry we are to lose you.</s> <s sid="66" id="alli.c4.s66">But it's a great thing for you to be going up to London."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="alli.c4.p19" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="alli.c4.s86"><qs/>"Do you?"<qe/> said he, as he held her hand for a few happy seconds.</s> <s sid="87" id="alli.c4.s87"><qs/>"And I'm sure I hope you'll always be happy.</s> <s sid="88" id="alli.c4.s88">Good-bye, Lily."<qe/></s> <s sid="89" id="alli.c4.s89">Then he left her, returning to the house, and she continued her walk, wandering down among the trees in the shrubbery, and not showing herself for the next half hour.</s> <s sid="90" id="alli.c4.s90">How many girls have some such lover as that--a lover who says no more to them than Johnny Eames then said to Lily Dale, who never says more than that?</s> <s sid="91" id="alli.c4.s91">And yet when, in after years, they count over the names of all who have loved them, the name of that awkward youth is never forgotten.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="alli.c4.p20"><s sid="92" id="alli.c4.s92">That farewell had been spoken nearly two years since, and Lily Dale was then seventeen.</s> <s sid="93" id="alli.c4.s93">Since that time, John Eames had been home once, and during his month's holidays had often visited Allington.</s> <s sid="94" id="alli.c4.s94">But he had never improved upon that occasion of which I have told.</s> <s sid="95" id="alli.c4.s95">It had seemed to him that Lily was colder to him than in old days, and he had become, if anything, more shy in his ways with her.</s> <s sid="96" id="alli.c4.s96">He was to return to Guestwick again during this autumn; but, to tell honestly the truth in the matter, Lily Dale did not think or care very much for his coming.</s> <s sid="97" id="alli.c4.s97">Girls of nineteen do not care for lovers of one-and-twenty, unless it be when the fruit has had the advantage of some forcing apparatus or southern wall.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="alli.c4.p21"><s sid="98" id="alli.c4.s98">John Eames's love was still as hot as ever, having been sustained on poetry, and kept alive, perhaps, by some close confidence in the ears of a brother clerk; but it is not to be supposed that during these two years he had been a melancholy lover.</s> <s sid="99" id="alli.c4.s99">It might, perhaps, have been better for him had his disposition led him to that line of life.</s> <s sid="100" id="alli.c4.s100">Such, however, had not been the case.</s> <s sid="101" id="alli.c4.s101">He had already abandoned the flute on which he had learned to sound three sad notes before he left Guestwick, and, after the fifth or sixth Sunday, he had relinquished his solitary walks along the towing-path of the Regent's Park Canal.</s> <s sid="102" id="alli.c4.s102">To think of one's absent love is very sweet; but it becomes monotonous after a mile or two of a towing-path, and the mind will turn away to Aunt Sally, the Cremorne Gardens, and financial questions.</s> <s sid="103" id="alli.c4.s103">I doubt whether any girl would be satisfied with her lover's mind if she knew the whole of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="alli.c6.p2"><s sid="3" id="alli.c6.s3">They were fair-haired girls, very like each other, of whom I have before my mind's eye a distinct portrait, which I fear I shall not be able to draw in any such manner as will make it distinct to others.</s> <s sid="4" id="alli.c6.s4">They were something below the usual height, being slight and slender in all their proportions.</s> <s sid="5" id="alli.c6.s5">Lily was the shorter of the two, but the difference was so trifling that it was hardly remembered unless the two were together.</s> <s sid="6" id="alli.c6.s6">And when I said that Bell was the prettier, I should, perhaps, have spoken more justly had I simply declared that her features were more regular than her sister's.</s> <s sid="7" id="alli.c6.s7">The two girls were very fair, so that the soft tint of colour which relieved the whiteness of their complexion was rather acknowledged than distinctly seen.</s> <s sid="8" id="alli.c6.s8">It was there, telling its own tale of health, as its absence would have told a tale of present or coming sickness; and yet nobody could ever talk about the colour in their cheeks.</s> <s sid="9" id="alli.c6.s9">The hair of the two girls was so alike in hue and texture, that no one, not even their mother, could say that there was a difference.</s> <s sid="10" id="alli.c6.s10">It was not flaxen hair, and yet it was very light.</s> <s sid="11" id="alli.c6.s11">Nor did it approach to auburn; and yet there ran through it a golden tint that gave it a distinct brightness of its own.</s> <s sid="12" id="alli.c6.s12">But with Bell it was more plentiful than with Lily, and therefore Lily would always talk of her own scanty locks, and tell how beautiful were those belonging to her sister.</s> <s sid="13" id="alli.c6.s13">Nevertheless Lily's head was quite as lovely as her sister's; for its form was perfect, and the simple braids in which they both wore their hair did not require any great exuberance in quantity.</s> <s sid="14" id="alli.c6.s14">Their eyes were brightly blue; but Bell's were long, and soft, and tender, often hardly daring to raise themselves to your face; while those of Lily were rounder, but brighter, and seldom kept by any want of courage from fixing themselves where they pleased.</s> <s sid="15" id="alli.c6.s15">And Lily's face was perhaps less oval in its formless perfectly oval--than her sister's.</s> <s sid="16" id="alli.c6.s16">The shape of the forehead was, I think, the same, but with Bell the chin was something more slender and delicate.</s> <s sid="17" id="alli.c6.s17">But Bell's chin was unmarked, whereas on her sister's there was a dimple which amply compensated for any other deficiency in its beauty.</s> <s sid="18" id="alli.c6.s18">Bell's teeth were more even than her sister's; but then she showed her teeth more frequently.</s> <s sid="19" id="alli.c6.s19">Her lips were thinner, and, as I cannot but think, less expressive.</s> <s sid="20" id="alli.c6.s20">Her nose was decidedly more regular in its beauty, for Lily's nose was somewhat broader than it should have been.</s> <s sid="21" id="alli.c6.s21">It may, therefore, be understood that Bell would be considered the beauty by the family.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="alli.c6.p3"><s sid="22" id="alli.c6.s22">But there was, perhaps, more in the general impression made by these girls, and in the whole tone of their appearance, than in the absolute loveliness of their features or the grace of their figures.</s> <s sid="23" id="alli.c6.s23">There was about them a dignity of demeanour devoid of all stiffness or pride, and a maidenly modesty which gave itself no airs.</s> <s sid="24" id="alli.c6.s24">In them was always apparent that sense of security which women should receive from an unconscious dependence on their own mingled purity and weakness.</s> <s sid="25" id="alli.c6.s25">These two girls were never afraid of men--never looked as though they were so afraid.</s> <s sid="26" id="alli.c6.s26">And I may say that they had little cause for that kind of fear to which I allude.</s> <s sid="27" id="alli.c6.s27">It might be the lot of either of them to be ill-used by a man, but it was hardly possible that either of them should ever be insulted by one.</s> <s sid="28" id="alli.c6.s28">Lily, as may, perhaps, have been already seen, could be full of play, but in her play she never so carried herself that any one could forget what was due to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="alli.c6.p4"><s sid="29" id="alli.c6.s29">And now Lily Dale was engaged to be married, and the days of her playfulness were over.</s> <s sid="30" id="alli.c6.s30">It sounds sad, this sentence against her, but I fear that it must be regarded as true.</s> <s sid="31" id="alli.c6.s31">And when I think that it is true--when I see that the sportiveness and kitten-like gambols of girlhood should be over, and generally are over, when a girl has given her troth, it becomes a matter of regret to me that the feminine world should be in such a hurry after matrimony.</s> <s sid="32" id="alli.c6.s32">I have, however, no remedy to offer for the evil; and, indeed, am aware that the evil, if there be an evil, is not well expressed in the words I have used.</s> <s sid="33" id="alli.c6.s33">The hurry is not for matrimony, but for love.</s> <s sid="34" id="alli.c6.s34">Then, the love once attained, matrimony seizes it for its own, and the evil is accomplished.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="alli.c6.p5"><s sid="35" id="alli.c6.s35">And Lily Dale was engaged to be married to Adolphus Crosbie--to Apollo Crosbie, as she still called him, confiding her little joke to his own ears.</s> <s sid="36" id="alli.c6.s36">And to her he was an Apollo, as a man who is loved should be to the girl who loves him.</s> <s sid="37" id="alli.c6.s37">He was handsome, graceful, clever, and self-confident, and always cheerful when she ask him to be cheerful.</s> <s sid="38" id="alli.c6.s38">But he had also his more serious moments, and could talk to her of serious matters.</s> <s sid="39" id="alli.c6.s39">He would read to her, and explain to her things which had hitherto been too hard for her young intelligence.</s> <s sid="40" id="alli.c6.s40">His voice, too, was pleasant, and well under command.</s> <s sid="41" id="alli.c6.s41">It could be pathetic if pathos were required, or ring with laughter as merry as her own.</s> <s sid="42" id="alli.c6.s42">Was not such a man fit to be an Apollo to such a girl, when once the girl had acknowledged to herself that she loved him?</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="alli.c6.p6"><s sid="43" id="alli.c6.s43">She had acknowledged it to herself, and had acknowledged it to him--as the reader will perhaps say without much delay.</s> <s sid="44" id="alli.c6.s44">But the courtship had so been carried on that no delay had been needed.</s> <s sid="45" id="alli.c6.s45">All the world had smiled upon it.</s> <s sid="46" id="alli.c6.s46">When Mr Crosbie had first come among them at Allington, as Bernard's guest, during those few days of his early visit, it had seemed as though Bell had been chiefly noticed by him.</s> <s sid="47" id="alli.c6.s47">And Bell in her own quiet way had accepted his admiration, saying nothing of it and thinking but very little.</s> <s sid="48" id="alli.c6.s48">Lily was heart-free at the time, and had ever been so.</s> <s sid="49" id="alli.c6.s49">No first shadow from Love's wing had as yet been thrown across the pure tablets of her bosom.</s> <s sid="50" id="alli.c6.s50">With Bell it was not so--not so in absolute strictness.</s> <s sid="51" id="alli.c6.s51">Bell's story, too, must be told, but not on this page.</s> <s sid="52" id="alli.c6.s52">But before Crosbie had come among them, it was a thing fixed in her mind that such love as she had felt must be overcome and annihilated.</s> <s sid="53" id="alli.c6.s53">We may say that it had been overcome and annihilated, and that she would have sinned in no way had she listened to vows from this new Apollo.</s> <s sid="54" id="alli.c6.s54">It is almost sad to think that such a man might have had the love of either of such girls, but I fear that I must acknowledge that it was so.</s> <s sid="55" id="alli.c6.s55">Apollo, in the plenitude of his power, soon changed his mind; and before the end of his first visit, had transferred the distant homage which he was then paying from the elder to the younger sister.</s> <s sid="56" id="alli.c6.s56">He afterwards returned, as the squire's guest, for a longer sojourn among them, and at the end of the first month had already been accepted as Lily's future husband.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="alli.c6.p7"><s sid="57" id="alli.c6.s57">It was beautiful to see how Bell changed in her mood towards Crosbie and towards her sister as soon as she perceived how the affair was going.</s> <s sid="58" id="alli.c6.s58">She was not long in perceiving it, having caught the first glimpses of the idea on that evening when they both dined at the Great House, leaving their mother alone to eat or to neglect the peas.</s> <s sid="59" id="alli.c6.s59">For some six or seven weeks Crosbie had been gone, and during that time Bell had been much more open in speaking of him than her sister.</s> <s sid="60" id="alli.c6.s60">She had been present when Crosbie had bid them good-bye, and had listened to his eagerness as he declared to Lily that he should soon be back again at Allington.</s> <s sid="61" id="alli.c6.s61">Lily had taken this very quietly, as though it had not belonged at all to herself; but Bell had seen something of the truth, and, believing in Crosbie as an earnest, honest man, had spoken kind words of him, fostering any little aptitude for love which might already have formed itself in Lily's bosom.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="alli.c6.p8" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="alli.c6.s62"><qs/>"But he is such an Apollo, you know,"<qe/> Lily had said.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="alli.c6.p9" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="alli.c6.s63"><qs/>"He is a gentleman; I can see that."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="alli.c6.p10" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="alli.c6.s64"><qs/>"Oh, yes; a man can't be an Apollo unless he's a gentleman."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="alli.c6.p11" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="alli.c6.s65"><qs/>"And he's very clever."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="alli.c6.p12" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="alli.c6.s66"><qs/>"I suppose he is clever."<qe/></s> <s sid="67" id="alli.c6.s67">There was nothing more said about his being a mere clerk.</s> <s sid="68" id="alli.c6.s68">Indeed, Lily had changed her mind on that subject.</s> <s sid="69" id="alli.c6.s69">Johnny Eames was a mere clerk; whereas Crosbie, if he was to be called a clerk at all, was a clerk of some very special denomination.</s> <s sid="70" id="alli.c6.s70">There may be a great difference between one clerk and another!</s> <s sid="71" id="alli.c6.s71">A Clerk of the Council and a parish clerk are very different persons.</s> <s sid="72" id="alli.c6.s72">Lily had got some such idea as this into her head as she attempted in her own mind to rescue Mr Crosbie from the lower orders of the Government service.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="alli.c6.p13" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="alli.c6.s73"><qs/>"I wish he were not coming,"<qe/> Mrs Dale had said to her eldest daughter.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="alli.c6.p17" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="alli.c6.s78"><qs/>"But she is so young, Bell."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="alli.c6.p18" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="alli.c6.s79"><qs/>"She is nineteen; and if they were engaged, perhaps, they might wait for a year or so.</s> <s sid="80" id="alli.c6.s80">But it's no good talking in that way, mamma.</s> <s sid="81" id="alli.c6.s81">If you were to tell Lily not to give him encouragement, she would not speak to him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="alli.c6.p19" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="alli.c6.s82"><qs/>"I should not think of interfering."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="alli.c6.p20" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="alli.c6.s83"><qs/>"No, mamma; and therefore it must take its course.</s> <s sid="84" id="alli.c6.s84">For myself, I like Mr Crosbie very much."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="alli.c6.p21" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="alli.c6.s85"><qs/>"So do I, my dear."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="alli.c6.p24" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="alli.c6.s89"><qs/>"But it must be considered a good thing if she happens to choose one of his liking."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="alli.c6.p25"><s sid="90" id="alli.c6.s90">In this way the matter had been talked over between the mother and her elder daughter.</s> <s sid="91" id="alli.c6.s91">Then Mr Crosbie had come; and before the end of the first month his declared admiration for Lily had proved the correctness of her sister's foresight.</s> <s sid="92" id="alli.c6.s92">And during that short courtship all had gone well with the lovers.</s> <s sid="93" id="alli.c6.s93">The squire from the first had declared himself satisfied with the match, informing Mrs Dale, in his cold manner, that Mr Crosbie was a gentleman with an income sufficient for matrimony.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="alli.c6.p26" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="alli.c6.s94"><qs/>"It would be close enough in London,"<qe/> Mrs Dale had said.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="alli.c6.p27" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="alli.c6.s95"><qs/>"He has more than my brother had when he married,"<qe/> said the squire.</s> <s sid="96" id="alli.c6.s96"><qs/>"If he will only make her as happy as your brother made me--while it lasted!"<qe/> said Mrs Dale, as she turned away her face to conceal a tear that was coming.</s> <s sid="97" id="alli.c6.s97">And then there was nothing more said about it between the squire and his sister-in-law.</s> <s sid="98" id="alli.c6.s98">The squire spoke no word as to assistance in money matters--did not even suggest that he would lend a hand to the young people at starting, as an uncle in such a position might surely have done.</s> <s sid="99" id="alli.c6.s99">It may well be conceived that Mrs Dale herself said nothing on the subject.</s> <s sid="100" id="alli.c6.s100">And, indeed, it may be conceived, also, that the squire, let his intentions be what they might, would not divulge them to Mrs Dale.</s> <s sid="101" id="alli.c6.s101">This was uncomfortable, but the position was one that was well understood between them.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="alli.c6.p28"><s sid="102" id="alli.c6.s102">Bernard Dale was still at Allington, and had remained there through the period of Crosbie's absence.</s> <s sid="103" id="alli.c6.s103">Whatever words Mrs Dale might choose to speak on the matter would probably be spoken to him; but, then, Bernard could be quite as close as his uncle.</s> <s sid="104" id="alli.c6.s104">When Crosbie returned, he and Bernard had, of course, lived much together; and, as was natural, there came to be close discussion between them as to the two girls, when Crosbie allowed it to be understood that his liking for Lily was becoming strong.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="alli.c6.p29" type="speech"><s sid="105" id="alli.c6.s105"><qs/>"You know, I suppose, that my uncle wishes me to marry the elder one,"<qe/> Bernard had said.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="alli.c7.p2"><s sid="4" id="alli.c7.s4">It will be said that Bernard Dale was not in love; but they who bring such accusation against him, will bring it falsely.</s> <s sid="5" id="alli.c7.s5">He was in love with his cousin Bell according to his manner and fashion.</s> <s sid="6" id="alli.c7.s6">It was not his nature to love Bell as John Eames loved Lily; but then neither would his nature bring him into such a trouble as that which the charms of Amelia Roper had brought upon the poor clerk from the Income-tax Office.</s> <s sid="7" id="alli.c7.s7">Johnny was susceptible, as the word goes; whereas Captain Dale was a man who had his feelings well under control.</s> <s sid="8" id="alli.c7.s8">He was not one to make a fool of himself about a girl, or to die of a broken heart; but, nevertheless, he would probably love his wife when he got a wife, and would be a careful father to his children.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="alli.c7.p3"><s sid="9" id="alli.c7.s9">They were very intimate with each other now--these four.</s> <s sid="10" id="alli.c7.s10">It was Bernard and Adolphus, or sometimes Apollo, and Bell and Lily among them; and Crosbie found it to be pleasant enough.</s> <s sid="11" id="alli.c7.s11">A new position of life had come upon him, and one exceeding pleasant; but, nevertheless, there were moments in which cold fits of a melancholy nature came upon him.</s> <s sid="12" id="alli.c7.s12">He was doing the very thing which throughout all the years of his manhood he had declared to himself that he would not do.</s> <s sid="13" id="alli.c7.s13">According to his plan of life he was to have eschewed marriage, and to have allowed himself to regard it as a possible event only under the circumstances of wealth, rank, and beauty all coming in his way together.</s> <s sid="14" id="alli.c7.s14">As he had expected no such glorious prize, he had regarded himself as a man who would reign at the Beaufort and be potent at Sebright's to the end of his chapter.</s> <s sid="15" id="alli.c7.s15">But now--</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="alli.c7.p4"><s sid="16" id="alli.c7.s16">It was the fact that he had fallen from his settled position, vanquished by a silver voice, a pretty wit, and a pair of moderately bright eyes.</s> <s sid="17" id="alli.c7.s17">He was very fond of Lily, having in truth a stronger capability for falling in love than his friend Captain Dale; but was the sacrifice worth his while?</s> <s sid="18" id="alli.c7.s18">This was the question which he asked himself in those melancholy moments; while he was lying in bed, for instance, awake in the morning, when he was shaving himself, and sometimes also when the squire was prosy after dinner.</s> <s sid="19" id="alli.c7.s19">At such times as these, while he would be listening to Mr Dale, his self-reproaches would sometimes be very bitter.</s> <s sid="20" id="alli.c7.s20">Why should he undergo this, he, Crosbie of Sebright's, Crosbie of the General Committee Office, Crosbie who would allow no one to bore him between Charing Cross and the far end of Bayswater--why should he listen to the long-winded stories of such a one as Squire Dale?</s> <s sid="21" id="alli.c7.s21">If, indeed, the squire intended to be liberal to his niece, then it might be very well.</s> <s sid="22" id="alli.c7.s22">But as yet the squire had given no sign of such intention, and Crosbie was angry with himself in that he had not had the courage to ask a question on that subject.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="alli.c7.p5" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="alli.c7.s23">And thus the course of love was not all smooth to our Apollo.</s> <s sid="24" id="alli.c7.s24">It was still pleasant for him when he was there on the croquet ground, or sitting in Mrs Dale's drawing-room with all the privileges of an accepted lover.</s> <s sid="25" id="alli.c7.s25">It was pleasant to him also as he sipped the squire's claret, knowing that his coffee would soon be handed to him by a sweet girl who would have tripped across the two gardens on purpose to perform for him this service.</s> <s sid="26" id="alli.c7.s26">There is nothing pleasanter than all this, although a man when so treated does feel himself to look like a calf at the altar, ready for the knife, with blue ribbons round his horns and neck.</s> <s sid="27" id="alli.c7.s27">Crosbie felt that he was such a calf--and the more calf-like, in that he had not as yet dared to as a question about his wife's fortune.</s> <s sid="28" id="alli.c7.s28"><qs/>"I will have it out of the old fellow this evening,"<qe/> he said to himself, as he buttoned on his dandy shooting gaiters that morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="alli.c7.p6" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="alli.c7.s29"><qs/>"How nice he looks in them,"<qe/> Lily said to her sister afterwards, knowing nothing of the thoughts which had troubled her lover's mind while he was adorning his legs.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="alli.c7.p7" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="alli.c7.s30"><qs/>"I suppose we shall come back this way,"<qe/> Crosbie said, as they prepared to move away on their proper business when lunch was over.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="alli.c7.p8" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="alli.c7.s31"><qs/>"Well, not exactly!"<qe/> said Bernard.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="alli.c7.p9" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="alli.c7.s32"><qs/>"We shall make our way round by Darvell's farm, and so back by Gruddock's.</s> <s sid="33" id="alli.c7.s33">Are the girls going to dine up at the Great House today?"<qe/></s> <s sid="34" id="alli.c7.s34">The girls declared that they were not going to dine up at the Great House--that they did not intend going to the Great House at all that evening.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="alli.c7.p10" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="alli.c7.s35"><qs/>"Then, as you won't have to dress, you might as well meet us at Gruddock's gate, at the back of the farmyard.</s> <s sid="36" id="alli.c7.s36">We'll be there exactly at half-past five."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="alli.c7.p11" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="alli.c7.s37"><qs/>"That is to say, we're to be there at half-past five, and you'll keep us waiting for three-quarters of an hour,"<qe/> said Lily.</s> <s sid="38" id="alli.c7.s38">Nevertheless the arrangement as proposed was made, and the two ladies were not at all unwilling to make it.</s> <s sid="39" id="alli.c7.s39">It is thus that the game is carried on among unsophisticated people who really live in the country.</s> <s sid="40" id="alli.c7.s40">The farmyard gate at Farmer Gruddock's has not a fitting sound as a trysting-place in romance, but for people who are in earnest it does as well as any oak in the middle glade of a forest.</s> <s sid="41" id="alli.c7.s41">Lily Dale was quite in earnest--and so indeed was Adolphus Crosbie--only with him the earnest was beginning to take that shade of brown which most earnest things have to wear in this vale of tears.</s> <s sid="42" id="alli.c7.s42">With Lily it was as yet all rose-coloured.</s> <s sid="43" id="alli.c7.s43">And Bernard Dale was also in earnest.</s> <s sid="44" id="alli.c7.s44">Throughout this morning he had stood very near to Bell on the lawn, and had thought that his cousin did not receive his little whisperings with any aversion.</s> <s sid="45" id="alli.c7.s45">Why should she?</s> <s sid="46" id="alli.c7.s46">Lucky girl that she was, thus to have eight hundred a year pinned to her skirt!</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="alli.c7.p12" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="alli.c7.s47"><qs/>"I say, Dale,"<qe/> Crosbie said, as in the course of their day's work they had come round upon Gruddock's ground, and were preparing to finish off his turnips before they reached the farmyard gate.</s> <s sid="48" id="alli.c7.s48">And now, as Crosbie spoke, they stood leaning on the gate, looking at the turnips while the two dogs squatted on their haunches.</s> <s sid="49" id="alli.c7.s49">Crosbie had been very silent for the last mile or two, and had been making up his mind for this conversation.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="alli.c7.p13" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="alli.c7.s50"><qs/>"I say, Dale--your uncle has never said a word to me yet as to Lily's fortune."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="alli.c7.p18" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="alli.c7.s60"><qs/>"You should have asked him the question, if you thought there was any room for such a question."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="alli.c7.p22" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="alli.c7.s67"><qs/>"I only meant to say, that any discontent you may feel as to her money, or want of money, you must refer to my uncle, and not to the family at the Small House."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="alli.c8.p1"><s sid="1" id="alli.c8.s1">On the following morning at breakfast each of the three gentlemen at the Great House received a little note on pink paper, nominally from Mrs Dale, asking them to drink tea at the Small House on that day week.</s> <s sid="2" id="alli.c8.s2">At the bottom of the note which Lily had written for Mr Crosbie was added:</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="alli.c8.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="alli.c8.s3"><qs/>"Dancing on the lawn, if we can get anybody to stand up.</s> <s sid="4" id="alli.c8.s4">Of course you must come, whether you like it or not.</s> <s sid="5" id="alli.c8.s5">And Bernard also.</s> <s sid="6" id="alli.c8.s6">Do your possible to talk my uncle into coming."<qe/></s> <s sid="7" id="alli.c8.s7">And this note did something towards re-creating good-humour among them at the breakfast-table.</s> <s sid="8" id="alli.c8.s8">It was shown to the squire, and at last he was brought to say that he would perhaps go to Mrs Dale's little evening-party.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="alli.c8.p3"><s sid="9" id="alli.c8.s9">It may be well to explain that this promised entertainment had been originated with no special view to the pleasure of Mr Crosbie, but altogether on behalf of poor Johnny Eames.</s> <s sid="10" id="alli.c8.s10">What was to be done in that matter?</s> <s sid="11" id="alli.c8.s11">This question had been fully discussed between Mrs Dale and Bell, and they had come to the conclusion that it would behest to ask Johnny over to a little friendly gathering, in which he might be able to meet Lily with some strangers around them.</s> <s sid="12" id="alli.c8.s12">In this way his embarrassment might be overcome.</s> <s sid="13" id="alli.c8.s13">It would never do, as Mrs Dale said, that he should be suffered to stay away, unnoticed by them.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="alli.c8.p4" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="alli.c8.s14"><qs/>"When the ice is once broken he won't mind it,"<qe/> said Bell.</s> <s sid="15" id="alli.c8.s15">And, therefore, early in the day, a messenger was sent over to Guestwick, who returned with a note from Mrs Eames, saying that she would come on the evening in question, with her son and daughter.</s> <s sid="16" id="alli.c8.s16">They would keep the fly and get back to Guestwick the same evening.</s> <s sid="17" id="alli.c8.s17">This was added, as an offer had been made of beds for Mrs Eames and Mary.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="alli.c8.p5"><s sid="18" id="alli.c8.s18">Before the evening of the party another memorable occurrence had taken place at Allington, which must be described, in order that the feelings of the different people on that evening may be understood.</s> <s sid="19" id="alli.c8.s19">The squire had given his nephew to understand that he wished to have that matter settled as to his niece Bell; and as Bernard's views were altogether in accordance with the squire's, he resolved to comply with his uncle's wishes.</s> <s sid="20" id="alli.c8.s20">The project with him was not a new thing.</s> <s sid="21" id="alli.c8.s21">He did love his cousin quite sufficiently for purposes of matrimony, and was minded that it would be a good thing for him to marry.</s> <s sid="22" id="alli.c8.s22">He could not marry without money, but this marriage would give him an income without the trouble of intricate settlements, or the interference of lawyers hostile to his own interests.</s> <s sid="23" id="alli.c8.s23">It was possible that he might do better; but then it was possible also that he might do much worse; and, in addition to this, he was fond of his cousin.</s> <s sid="24" id="alli.c8.s24">He discussed the matter within himself, very calmly; made some excellent resolutions as to the kind of life which it would behove him to live as a married man; settled on the street in London in which he would have his house, and behaved very prettily to Bell for four or five days running.</s> <s sid="25" id="alli.c8.s25">That he did not make love to her, in the ordinary sense of the word, must, I suppose, be taken for granted, seeing that Bell herself did not recognise the fact.</s> <s sid="26" id="alli.c8.s26">She had always liked her cousin, and thought that in these days he was making himself particularly agreeable.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="alli.c8.p6"><s sid="27" id="alli.c8.s27">On the evening before the party the girls were at the Great House, having come up nominally with the intention of discussing the expediency of dancing on the lawn.</s> <s sid="28" id="alli.c8.s28">Lily had made up her mind that it was to be so, but Bell had objected that it would be cold and damp, and that the drawing-room would be nicer for dancing.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="alli.c8.p7" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="alli.c8.s29"><qs/>"You see we've only got four young gentlemen and one ungrown,"<qe/><sss/> said Lily; <sse/><qs/>"and they will look so stupid standing up all properly in a room, as though we had a regular party."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="alli.c8.p8" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="alli.c8.s30"><qs/>"Thank you for the compliment,"<qe/> said Crosbie, taking off his straw hat.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="alli.c8.p9" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="alli.c8.s31"><qs/>"So you will; and we girls will look more stupid still.</s> <s sid="32" id="alli.c8.s32">But out on the lawn it won't look stupid at all.</s> <s sid="33" id="alli.c8.s33">Two or three might stand up on the lawn, and it would be jolly enough."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="alli.c8.p10" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="alli.c8.s34"><qs/>"I don't quite see it,"<qe/> said Bernard.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="alli.c8.p11" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="alli.c8.s35"><qs/>"Yes, I think I see it,"<qe/> said Crosbie.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="alli.c8.p12" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="alli.c8.s36"><qs/>"The unadaptability of the lawn for the purpose of a ball--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="alli.c8.p13" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="alli.c8.s37"><qs/>"Nobody is thinking of a ball,"<qe/> said Lily, with mock petulance.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="alli.c8.p14" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="alli.c8.s38"><qs/>"I'm defending you, and yet you won't let me speak.</s> <s sid="39" id="alli.c8.s39">The unadaptability of the lawn for the purpose of a ball will conceal the insufficiency of four men and a boy as a supply of male dancers.</s> <s sid="40" id="alli.c8.s40">But, Lily, who is the ungrown gentleman?</s> <s sid="41" id="alli.c8.s41">Is it your old friend Johnny Eames?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="alli.c8.p15"><s sid="42" id="alli.c8.s42">Lily's voice became sobered as she answered him.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="alli.c8.p16" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="alli.c8.s43"><qs/>"Oh, no; I did not mean Mr Eames.</s> <s sid="44" id="alli.c8.s44">He is coming, but I did not mean him.</s> <s sid="45" id="alli.c8.s45">Dick Boyce, Mr Boyce's son, is only sixteen.</s> <s sid="46" id="alli.c8.s46">He is the ungrown gentleman."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="alli.c8.p17" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="alli.c8.s47"><qs/>"And who is the fourth adult."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="alli.c8.p18" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="alli.c8.s48"><qs/>"Dr Crofts, from Guestwick.</s> <s sid="49" id="alli.c8.s49">I do hope you will like him, Adolphus.</s> <s sid="50" id="alli.c8.s50">We think he is the very perfection of a man."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="alli.c8.p19" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="alli.c8.s51"><qs/>"Then of course I shall hate him; and be very jealous, too!"<qe/></s> <s sid="52" id="alli.c8.s52">And then that pair went off together, fighting their own little battle on that head, as turtle-doves will sometimes do.</s> <s sid="53" id="alli.c8.s53">They went off, and Bernard was left with Bell standing together over the ha-ha fence which divides the garden at the back of the house from the field.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="alli.c8.p20" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="alli.c8.s54"><qs/>"Bell,"<qe/> he said," they seem very happy, don't they?</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="alli.c8.p21" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="alli.c8.s55"><qs/>"And they ought to be happy now, oughtn't they?</s> <s sid="56" id="alli.c8.s56">Dear Lily!</s> <s sid="57" id="alli.c8.s57">I hope he will be good to her.</s> <s sid="58" id="alli.c8.s58">Do you know, Bernard, though he is your friend, I am very, very anxious about it.</s> <s sid="59" id="alli.c8.s59">It is such a vast trust to put in a man when we do not quite know him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="alli.c8.p22" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="alli.c8.s60"><qs/>"Yes, it is; but they'll do very well together.</s> <s sid="61" id="alli.c8.s61">Lily will be happy enough."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="alli.c8.p23" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="alli.c8.s62"><qs/>"And he?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="alli.c8.p24" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="alli.c8.s63"><qs/>"I suppose he'll be happy, too.</s> <s sid="64" id="alli.c8.s64">He'll feel himself a little straightened as to income at first, but that will all come round."<qe/></s> <s sid="65" id="alli.c8.s65"><qs/>"If he is not, she will be wretched."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="alli.c8.p25" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="alli.c8.s66"><qs/>"They will do very well.</s> <s sid="67" id="alli.c8.s67">Lily must be prepared to make the money go as far as she can, that's all."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="alli.c8.p26" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="alli.c8.s68"><qs/>"Lily won't feel the want of money.</s> <s sid="69" id="alli.c8.s69">It is not that.</s> <s sid="70" id="alli.c8.s70">But if he lets her know that she has made him a poor man, then she will be unhappy.</s> <s sid="71" id="alli.c8.s71">Is he extravagant, Bernard?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="alli.c8.p27"><s sid="72" id="alli.c8.s72">But Bernard was anxious to discuss another subject, and therefore would not speak such words of wisdom as to Lily's engagement as might have been expected from him had he been in a different frame of mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="alli.c8.p28" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="alli.c8.s73"><qs/>"No, I should say not,"<qe/> said he."</s> <s sid="74" id="alli.c8.s74">But, Bell--"</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="alli.c8.p29" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="alli.c8.s75"><qs/>"I do not know that we could have acted otherwise than we have done, and yet I fear that we have been rash.</s> <s sid="76" id="alli.c8.s76">If he makes her unhappy, Bernard, I shall never forgive you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="alli.c8.p30"><s sid="77" id="alli.c8.s77">But as she said this she put her hand lovingly upon his arm, as a cousin might do, and spoke in a tone which divested her threat of its acerbity.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="alli.c8.p31" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="alli.c8.s78"><qs/>"You must not quarrel with me, Bell, whatever may happen.</s> <s sid="79" id="alli.c8.s79">I cannot afford to quarrel with you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="alli.c8.p32" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="alli.c8.s80"><qs/>"Of course I was not in earnest as to that."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="alli.c8.p33" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="alli.c8.s81"><qs/>"You and I must never quarrel, Bell; at least, I hope not.</s> <s sid="82" id="alli.c8.s82">I could bear to quarrel with any one rather than with you."<qe/></s> <s sid="83" id="alli.c8.s83">And then, as he spoke, there was something in his voice which gave the girl some slight, indistinct warning of what might be his intention.</s> <s sid="84" id="alli.c8.s84">Not that she said to herself at once, that he was going to make her an offer of his hand--now, on the spot; but she felt that he intended something beyond the tenderness of ordinary cousinly affection.</s> <s sid="85" id="alli.c8.s85"><qs/>"I hope we shall never quarrel,"<qe/> she said.</s> <s sid="86" id="alli.c8.s86">But as she spoke, her mind was settling itself--forming its resolution, and coming to a conclusion as to the sort of love which Bernard might, perhaps, expect.</s> <s sid="87" id="alli.c8.s87">And it formed another conclusion; as to the sort of love which might be given in return.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="alli.c8.p34" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="alli.c8.s88"><qs/>"Bell,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"you and I have always been dear friends."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="alli.c8.p36" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="alli.c8.s90"><qs/>"Why should we not be something more than friends?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="alli.c8.p37"><s sid="91" id="alli.c8.s91">To give Captain Dale his due I must declare that his voice was perfectly natural as he asked this question, and that he showed no signs of nervousness, either in his face or limbs.</s> <s sid="92" id="alli.c8.s92">He had made up his mind to do it on that occasion, and he did it without any signs of outward disturbance.</s> <s sid="93" id="alli.c8.s93">He asked his question, and then he waited for his answer.</s> <s sid="94" id="alli.c8.s94">In this he was rather hard upon his cousin; for, though the question had certainly been asked in language that could not be mistaken, still the matter had not been put forward with all that fullness which a young lady, under such circumstances, has a right to expect.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="alli.c8.p38" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="alli.c8.s95">They had sat down on the turf close to the ha-ha, and they were so near that Bernard was able to put out his hand with the view of taking that of his cousin within his own.</s> <s sid="96" id="alli.c8.s96">But she contrived to keep her hands locked together, so that he merely held her gently by the wrist.</s> <s sid="97" id="alli.c8.s97"><qs/>"I don't quite understand, Bernard,"<qe/> she said, after a minute's pause.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="alli.c8.p39" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="alli.c8.s98"><qs/>"Shall we be more than cousins?</s> <s sid="99" id="alli.c8.s99">Shall we be man and wife?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="alli.c8.p40"><s sid="100" id="alli.c8.s100">Now, at least, she could not say that she did not understand.</s> <s sid="101" id="alli.c8.s101">If the question was ever asked plainly, Bernard Dale had asked it plainly.</s> <s sid="102" id="alli.c8.s102">Shall we be man and wife?</s> <s sid="103" id="alli.c8.s103">Few men, I fancy, dare to put it all at once in so abrupt a way, and yet I do not know that the English language affords any better terms for the question.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="alli.c8.p41" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="alli.c8.s104"><qs/>"Oh, Bernard! you have surprised me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="alli.c8.p43"><s sid="110" id="alli.c8.s110">He did not then say anything about his uncle, and the eight hundred a year; but he fully intended to do so as soon as an opportunity should serve.</s> <s sid="111" id="alli.c8.s111">He was quite of opinion that eight hundred a year and the good-will of a rich uncle were strong ground for matrimony--were grounds even for love; and he did not doubt but his cousin would see the matter in the same light.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="alli.c8.p44" type="speech"><s sid="112" id="alli.c8.s112"><qs/>"You are very good to me--more than good.</s> <s sid="113" id="alli.c8.s113">Of course I know that.</s> <s sid="114" id="alli.c8.s114">But, oh, Bernard I did not expect this a bit."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="alli.c15.p2"><s sid="7" id="alli.c15.s7">But Lily Dale had not yet been taught these lessons by her world's experience, and she expected that this sweetest cup of which she had ever drank should go on being sweet--sweeter and still sweeter--as long as she could press it to her lips.</s> <s sid="8" id="alli.c15.s8">How the dregs had come to mix themselves with the last drops we have already seen; and on that same day--on the Monday evening--the bitter task still remained; for Crosbie, as they walked about through the gardens in the evening, found other subjects on which he thought it necessary to give her sundry hints, intended for her edification, which came to her with much of the savour of a lecture.</s> <s sid="9" id="alli.c15.s9">A girl, when she is thoroughly in love, as surely was the case with Lily, likes to receive hints as to her future life from the man to whom she is devoted; but she would, I think, prefer that such hints should be short, and that the lesson should be implied rather than declared--that they should, in fact, be hints and not lectures.</s> <s sid="10" id="alli.c15.s10">Crosbie, who was a man of tact, who understood the world and had been dealing with women for many years, no doubt understood all this as well as we do.</s> <s sid="11" id="alli.c15.s11">But he had come to entertain a notion that he was an injured man, that he was giving very much more than was to be given to him, and that therefore he was entitled to take liberties which might not fairly be within the reach of another lover.</s> <s sid="12" id="alli.c15.s12">My reader will say that in all this he was ungenerous.</s> <s sid="13" id="alli.c15.s13">Well; he was ungenerous.</s> <s sid="14" id="alli.c15.s14">I do not know that I have ever said that much generosity was to be expected from him.</s> <s sid="15" id="alli.c15.s15">He had some principles of right and wrong under the guidance of which it may perhaps be hoped that he will not go utterly astray; but his past life had not been of a nature to make him unselfish.</s> <s sid="16" id="alli.c15.s16">He was ungenerous, and Lily felt it, though she would not acknowledge it even to herself.</s> <s sid="17" id="alli.c15.s17">She had been very open with him--acknowledging the depth of her love for him; telling him that he was now all in all to her; that life without his love would be impossible to her: and in a certain way he took advantage of these strong avowals, treating her as though she were a creature utterly in his power--as indeed she was.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="alli.c15.p3"><s sid="18" id="alli.c15.s18">On that evening he said no more of Johnny Eames, but said much of the difficulty of a man establishing himself with a wife in London, who had nothing but his own moderate income on which to rely.</s> <s sid="19" id="alli.c15.s19">He did not in so many words tell her that if her friends could make up for her two or three thousand pounds--that being much less than he had expected when he first made his offer--this terrible difficulty would be removed; but he said enough to make her understand that the world would call him very imprudent in taking a girl who had nothing.</s> <s sid="20" id="alli.c15.s20">And as he spoke of these things, Lily remaining for the most part silent as he did so, it occurred to him that he might talk to her freely of his past life--more freely than he would have done had he feared that he might lose her by any such disclosures.</s> <s sid="21" id="alli.c15.s21">He had no fear of losing her.</s> <s sid="22" id="alli.c15.s22">Alas! might it not be possible that he had some such hope!</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="alli.c15.p4" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="alli.c15.s23">He told her that his past life had been expensive; that, though he was not in debt, he had lived up to every shilling that he had, and that he had contracted habits of expenditure which it would be almost impossible for him to lay aside at a day's notice.</s> <s sid="24" id="alli.c15.s24">Then he spoke of entanglements, meaning, as he did so, to explain more fully what were their nature--but not daring to do so when he found that Lily was altogether in the dark as to what he meant.</s> <s sid="25" id="alli.c15.s25">No; he was not a generous man--a very ungenerous man.</s> <s sid="26" id="alli.c15.s26">And yet, during all this time, he thought that he was guided by principle.</s> <s sid="27" id="alli.c15.s27"><qs/>"It will be best that I should be honest with her,"<qe/> he said to himself.</s> <s sid="28" id="alli.c15.s28">And then he told himself, scores of times, that when making his offer he had expected, and had a right to expect, that she would not be penniless.</s> <s sid="29" id="alli.c15.s29">Under those circumstances he had done the best he could for her--offering her his heart honestly, with a quick readiness to make her his own at the earliest day that she might think possible.</s> <s sid="30" id="alli.c15.s30">Had he been more cautious, he need not have fallen into this cruel mistake; but she, at any rate, could not quarrel with him for his imprudence.</s> <s sid="31" id="alli.c15.s31">And still he was determined to stand by his engagement and willing to marry her, although, as he the more thought of it, he felt the more strongly that he would thereby ruin his prospects, and thrust beyond his own reach all those good things which he had hoped to win.</s> <s sid="32" id="alli.c15.s32">As he continued to talk to her he gave himself special credit for his generosity, and felt that he was only doing his duty by her in pointing out to her all the difficulties which lay in the way of their marriage.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="alli.c15.p5" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="alli.c15.s33">At first Lily said some words intended to convey an assurance that she would be the most economical wife that man ever had, but she soon ceased from such promises as these.</s> <s sid="34" id="alli.c15.s34">Her perceptions were keen, and she discovered that the difficulties of which he was afraid were those which he must overcome before his marriage, not any which might be expected to overwhelm him after it.</s> <s sid="35" id="alli.c15.s35"><qs/>"A cheap and nasty menage would be my aversion,"<qe/> he said to her.</s> <s sid="36" id="alli.c15.s36"><qs/>"It is that which I want to avoid--chiefly for your sake."<qe/></s> <s sid="37" id="alli.c15.s37">Then she promised him that she would wait patiently for his time--<qs/>"I suppose we shall have to wait two years.</s> <s sid="38" id="alli.c15.s38">And that's a deuce of a bore--a terrible bore."<qe/></s> <s sid="39" id="alli.c15.s39">And there was that in the tone of his voice which grated on her feelings, and made her wretched for the moment.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="alli.c15.p6" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="alli.c15.s40">As he parted with her for the night on her own side of the little bridge which led from one garden to the other, he put his arm round her to embrace her and kiss her, as he had often done at that spot.</s> <s sid="41" id="alli.c15.s41">It had become a habit with them to say their evening farewells there, and the secluded little nook amongst the shrubs was inexpressibly dear to Lily.</s> <s sid="42" id="alli.c15.s42">But on the present occasion she made an effort to avoid his caress, She turned from him--very slightly, but it was enough, and he felt it.</s> <s sid="43" id="alli.c15.s43"><qs/>"Are you angry with me?"<qe/> he said.</s> <s sid="44" id="alli.c15.s44"><qs/>"Oh, no!</s> <s sid="45" id="alli.c15.s45">Adolphus; how can I be angry with you?"<qe/></s> <s sid="46" id="alli.c15.s46">And then she turned to him and gave him her face to kiss almost before he had again asked for it.</s> <s sid="47" id="alli.c15.s47"><qs/>"He shall not at any rate think that I am unkind to him--and it will not matter now,"<qe/> she said to herself, as she walked slowly across the lawn, in the dark, up to her mother's drawing-room window.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="alli.c15.p7" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="alli.c15.s48"><qs/>"Well, dearest,"<qe/><sls/> said Mrs Dale, who was there alone; <sle/><qs/>"did the beards wag merry in the Great Hall this evening?"<qe/></s> <s sid="49" id="alli.c15.s49">That was a joke with them, for neither Crosbie nor Bernard Dale used a razor at his toilet.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="alli.c15.p8" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="alli.c15.s50"><qs/>"Not specially merry.</s> <s sid="51" id="alli.c15.s51">And I think it was my fault, for I have a headache.</s> <s sid="52" id="alli.c15.s52">Mamma, I believe I will go at once to bed."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="alli.c15.p9"><s sid="53" id="alli.c15.s53">"My darling, is there anything wrong?</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="alli.c15.p10" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="alli.c15.s54"><qs/>"Nothing, mamma.</s> <s sid="55" id="alli.c15.s55">But we had such a long ride; and then Adolphus is going, and of course we have so much to say.</s> <s sid="56" id="alli.c15.s56">Tomorrow will be the last day, for I shall only just see him on Wednesday morning; and as I want to be well, if possible, I'll go to bed."<qe/></s> <s sid="57" id="alli.c15.s57">And so she took her candle and went.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="alli.c15.p11" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="alli.c15.s58">When Bell came up, Lily was still awake, but she begged her sister not to disturb her.</s> <s sid="59" id="alli.c15.s59"><qs/>"Don't talk to me, Bell,"<qe/> she said."</s> <s sid="60" id="alli.c15.s60">I'm trying to make myself quiet, and I half feel that I should get childish if I went on talking.</s> <s sid="61" id="alli.c15.s61">I have almost more to think of than I know how to manage."</s> <s sid="62" id="alli.c15.s62">And she strove, not altogether unsuccessfully, to speak with a cheery tone, as though the cares which weighed upon her were not unpleasant in their nature.</s> <s sid="63" id="alli.c15.s63">Then her sister kissed her and left her to her thoughts.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="alli.c15.p12"><s sid="64" id="alli.c15.s64">And she had great matter for thinking; so great, that many hours sounded in her ears from the clock on the stairs before she brought her thoughts to a shape that satisfied herself.</s> <s sid="65" id="alli.c15.s65">She did so bring them at last, and then she slept.</s> <s sid="66" id="alli.c15.s66">She did so bring them, toiling over her work with tears that made her pillow wet, with heart-burning and almost with heart-breaking, with much doubting, and many anxious, eager inquiries within her own bosom as to that which she ought to do, and that which she could endure to do.</s> <s sid="67" id="alli.c15.s67">But at last her resolve was taken, and then she slept.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="alli.c15.p13"><s sid="68" id="alli.c15.s68">It had been agreed between them that Crosbie should come down to the Small House on the next day after breakfast, and remain there till the time came for riding.</s> <s sid="69" id="alli.c15.s69">But Lily determined to alter this arrangement, and accordingly put on her hat immediately after breakfast, and posted herself at the bridge, so as to intercept her lover as he came.</s> <s sid="70" id="alli.c15.s70">He soon appeared with his friend Dale, and she at once told him her purpose.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="alli.c15.p14" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="alli.c15.s71"><qs/>"I want to have a talk with you, Adolphus, before you go in to mamma; so come with me into the field."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="alli.c15.p15" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="alli.c15.s72"><qs/>"All right,"<qe/> said he.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="alli.c15.p16" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="alli.c15.s73"><qs/>"And Bernard can finish his cigar on the lawn.</s> <s sid="74" id="alli.c15.s74">Mamma and Bell will join him there."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="alli.c15.p17" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="alli.c15.s75"><qs/>"All right,"<qe/> said Bernard.</s> <s sid="76" id="alli.c15.s76">So they separated; and Crosbie went away with Lily into the field where they had first learned to know each other in those haymaking days.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="alli.c15.p18"><s sid="77" id="alli.c15.s77">She did not say much till they were well away from the house; but answered what words he chose to speak--not knowing very well of what he spoke.</s> <s sid="78" id="alli.c15.s78">But when she considered that they had reached the proper spot, she began very abruptly.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="alli.c15.p19" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="alli.c15.s79"><qs/>"Adolphus,"<qe/><sss/> she said, <sse/><qs/>"I have something to say to you--something to which you must listen very carefully."<qe/></s> <s sid="80" id="alli.c15.s80">Then he looked at her, and at once knew that she was in earnest.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="alli.c17.p1"><s sid="1" id="alli.c17.s1">Courcy Castle was very full.</s> <s sid="2" id="alli.c17.s2">In the first place, there was a great gathering there of all the Courcy family.</s> <s sid="3" id="alli.c17.s3">The earl was there--and the countess, of course.</s> <s sid="4" id="alli.c17.s4">At this period of the year Lady de Courcy was always at home; but the presence of the earl himself had heretofore been by no means so certain.</s> <s sid="5" id="alli.c17.s5">He was a man who had been much given to royal visitings and attendances, to parties in the Highlands, to--no doubt necessary--prolongations of the London season, to sojournings at certain German watering-places, convenient, probably, in order that he might study the ways and ceremonies of German Courts--and to various other absences from home, occasioned by a close pursuit of his own special aims in life; for the Earl de Courcy had been a great courtier.</s> <s sid="6" id="alli.c17.s6">But of late gout, lumbago, and perhaps also some diminution in his powers of making himself generally agreeable, had reconciled him to domestic duties, and the earl spent much of his time at home.</s> <s sid="7" id="alli.c17.s7">The countess, in former days, had been heard to complain of her lord's frequent absence.</s> <s sid="8" id="alli.c17.s8">But it is hard to please some women--and now she would not always be satisfied with his presence.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="alli.c17.p2"><s sid="9" id="alli.c17.s9">And all the sons and daughters were there--excepting Lord Porlock, the eldest, who never met his father.</s> <s sid="10" id="alli.c17.s10">The earl and Lord Porlock were not on terms, and indeed hated each other as only such fathers and such sons can hate.</s> <s sid="11" id="alli.c17.s11">The Honourable George de Courcy was there with his bride, he having lately performed a manifest duty, in having married a young woman with money.</s> <s sid="12" id="alli.c17.s12">Very young she was not--having reached some years of her life in advance of thirty; but then, neither was the Honourable George very young; and in this respect the two were not ill-sorted.</s> <s sid="13" id="alli.c17.s13">The lady's money had not been very much--perhaps thirty thousand pounds or so.</s> <s sid="14" id="alli.c17.s14">But then the Honourable George's money had been absolutely none.</s> <s sid="15" id="alli.c17.s15">Now he had an income on which he could live, and therefore his father and mother had forgiven him all his sins, and taken him again to their bosom.</s> <s sid="16" id="alli.c17.s16">And the marriage was matter of great moment, for the elder scion of the house had not yet taken to himself a wife, and the De Courcy family might have to look to this union for an heir.</s> <s sid="17" id="alli.c17.s17">The lady herself was not beautiful, or clever, or of imposing manners--nor was she of high birth.</s> <s sid="18" id="alli.c17.s18">But neither was she ugly, nor unbearably stupid.</s> <s sid="19" id="alli.c17.s19">Her manners were, at any rate, innocent; and as to her birth--seeing that, from the first, she was not supposed to have had any--no disappointment was felt.</s> <s sid="20" id="alli.c17.s20">Her father had been a coal-merchant.</s> <s sid="21" id="alli.c17.s21">She was always called Mrs George, and the effort made respecting her by everybody in and about the family was to treat her as though she were a figure of a woman, a large well-dressed resemblance of a being, whom it was necessary for certain purposes that the De Courcys should carry in their train.</s> <s sid="22" id="alli.c17.s22">Of the Honourable George we may further observe, that, having been a spendthrift all his life, he had now become strictly parsimonious.</s> <s sid="23" id="alli.c17.s23">Having reached the discreet age of forty, he had at last learned that beggary was objectionable; and he, therefore, devoted every energy of his mind to saving shillings and pence wherever pence and shillings might be saved.</s> <s sid="24" id="alli.c17.s24">When first this turn came upon him both his father and mother were delighted to observe it; but, although it had hardly yet lasted over twelve months, some evil results were beginning to appear.</s> <s sid="25" id="alli.c17.s25">Though possessed of an income, he would take no steps towards possessing himself of a house.</s> <s sid="26" id="alli.c17.s26">He hung by the paternal mansion, either in town or country; drank the paternal wines, rode the paternal horses, and had even contrived to obtain his wife's dresses from the maternal milliner.</s> <s sid="27" id="alli.c17.s27">In the completion of which little last success, however, some slight family dissent had showed itself.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="alli.c17.p3"><s sid="28" id="alli.c17.s28">The Honourable John, the third son, was also at Courcy.</s> <s sid="29" id="alli.c17.s29">He had as yet taken to himself no wife, and as he had not hitherto made himself conspicuously useful in any special walk of life his family were beginning to regard him as a burden.</s> <s sid="30" id="alli.c17.s30">Having no income of his own to save, he had not copied his brother's virtue of parsimony; and, to tell the truth plainly, had made himself so generally troublesome to his father, that he had been on more than one occasion threatened with expulsion from the family roof.</s> <s sid="31" id="alli.c17.s31">But it is not easy to expel a son.</s> <s sid="32" id="alli.c17.s32">Human fledglings cannot be driven out of the nest like young birds.</s> <s sid="33" id="alli.c17.s33">An Honourable John turned adrift into absolute poverty will make himself heard of in the world--if in no other way, by his ugliness as he starves.</s> <s sid="34" id="alli.c17.s34">A thorough-going ne'er-do-well in the upper classes has eminent advantages on his side in the battle which he fights against respectability.</s> <s sid="35" id="alli.c17.s35">He can't be sent to Australia against his will.</s> <s sid="36" id="alli.c17.s36">He can't be sent to the poor-house without the knowledge of all the world.</s> <s sid="37" id="alli.c17.s37">He can't be kept out of tradesmen's shops; nor, without terrible scandal, can he be kept away from the paternal properties.</s> <s sid="38" id="alli.c17.s38">The earl had threatened, and snarled, and shown his teeth; he was an angry man, and a man who could look very angry; with eyes which could almost become red, and a brow that wrinkled itself in perpendicular wrinkles, sometimes very terrible to behold.</s> <s sid="39" id="alli.c17.s39">But he was an inconstant man, and the Honourable John had learned to measure his father, and in an accurate balance.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="alli.c17.p4"><s sid="40" id="alli.c17.s40">I have mentioned the sons first, because it is to be presumed that they were the elder, seeing that their names were mentioned before those of their sisters in all the peerages.</s> <s sid="41" id="alli.c17.s41">But there were four daughters--the Ladies Amelia, Rosina, Margaretta, and Alexandrina.</s> <s sid="42" id="alli.c17.s42">They, we may say, were the flowers of the family, having so lived that they had created none of those family feuds which had been so frequent between their father and their brothers.</s> <s sid="43" id="alli.c17.s43">They were discreet, highbred women, thinking, perhaps, a little too much of their own position in the world, and somewhat apt to put a wrong value on those advantages which they possessed, and on those which they did not possess.</s> <s sid="44" id="alli.c17.s44">The Lady Amelia was already married, having made a substantial if not a brilliant match with Mr Mortimer Gazebee, a flourishing solicitor, belonging to a firm which had for many years acted as agents to the De Courcy property.</s> <s sid="45" id="alli.c17.s45">Mortimer Gazebee was now member of Parliament for Barchester, partly through the influence of his father-in-law.</s> <s sid="46" id="alli.c17.s46">That this should be so was a matter of great disgust to the Honourable George, who thought that the seat should have belonged to him.</s> <s sid="47" id="alli.c17.s47">But as Mr Gazebee had paid the very heavy expenses of the election out of his own pocket, and as George de Courcy certainly could not have paid them, the justice of his claim may be questionable.</s> <s sid="48" id="alli.c17.s48">Mrs Gazebee was now the happy mother of many babies, whom she was wont to carry with her on her visits to Courcy Castle, and had become an excellent partner to her husband He would perhaps have liked it better if she had not spoken so frequently to him of her own high position as the daughter of an earl, or so frequently to others of her low position as the wife of an attorney.</s> <s sid="49" id="alli.c17.s49">But, on the whole, they did very well together, and Mr Gazebee had gotten from his marriage quite as much as he expected when he made it.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="alli.c17.p5"><s sid="50" id="alli.c17.s50">The Lady Rosina was very religious; and I do not know that she was conspicuous in any other way, unless it might be that she somewhat resembled her father, in her temper.</s> <s sid="51" id="alli.c17.s51">It was of the Lady Rosina that the servants were afraid, especially with reference to that so-called day of rest which, under her dominion, had become to many of them a day of restless torment.</s> <s sid="52" id="alli.c17.s52">It had not always been so with the Lady Rosina; but her eyes had been opened by the wife of a great church dignitary in the neighbourhood, and she had undergone regeneration.</s> <s sid="53" id="alli.c17.s53">How great may be the misery inflicted by an energetic, unmarried, healthy woman in that condition--a woman with no husband, or children, or duties, to distract her from her work--I pray that my readers may never know.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="alli.c17.p6"><s sid="54" id="alli.c17.s54">The Lady Margaretta was her mother's favourite, and she was like her mother in all things--except that her mother had been a beauty.</s> <s sid="55" id="alli.c17.s55">The world called her proud, disdainful, and even insolent; but the world was not aware that in all that she did she was acting in accordance with a principle which had called for much self-abnegation.</s> <s sid="56" id="alli.c17.s56">She had considered it her duty to be a De Courcy and an earl's daughter at all times; and consequently she had sacrificed to her idea of duty all popularity, adulation, and such admiration as would have been awarded to her as a well-dressed, tall, fashionable, and by no means stupid young woman.</s> <s sid="57" id="alli.c17.s57">To be at all times in something higher than they who were manifestly below her in rank--that was the effort that she was ever making.</s> <s sid="58" id="alli.c17.s58">But she had been a good daughter, assisting her mother, as best she might, in all family troubles, and never repining at the cold, colourless, unlovely life which had been vouchsafed to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="alli.c17.p7"><s sid="59" id="alli.c17.s59">Alexandrina was the beauty of the family, and was in truth the youngest.</s> <s sid="60" id="alli.c17.s60">But even she was not very young, and was beginning to make her friends uneasy lest she, too, should let the precious season of hay-harvest run by without due use of her summer's sun.</s> <s sid="61" id="alli.c17.s61">She had, perhaps, counted too much on her beauty, which had been beauty according to law rather than beauty according to taste, and had looked, probably, for too bounteous a harvest.</s> <s sid="62" id="alli.c17.s62">That her forehead, and nose, and cheeks, and chin were well-formed, no man could deny.</s> <s sid="63" id="alli.c17.s63">Her hair was soft and plentiful.</s> <s sid="64" id="alli.c17.s64">Her teeth were good, and her eyes were long and oval.</s> <s sid="65" id="alli.c17.s65">But the fault of her face was this--that when you left her you could not remember it.</s> <s sid="66" id="alli.c17.s66">After a first acquaintance you could meet her again and not know her.</s> <s sid="67" id="alli.c17.s67">After many meetings you would fail to carry away with you any portrait of her features.</s> <s sid="68" id="alli.c17.s68">But such as she had been at twenty, such was she now at thirty.</s> <s sid="69" id="alli.c17.s69">Years had not robbed her face of its regularity, or ruffled the smoothness of her too even forehead.</s> <s sid="70" id="alli.c17.s70">Rumour had declared that on more than one, or perhaps more than two occasions, Lady Alexandrina had been already induced to plight her troth in return for proffered love; but we all know that Rumour, when she takes to such topics, exaggerates the truth, and sets down much in malice.</s> <s sid="71" id="alli.c17.s71">The lady was once engaged, the engagement lasting for two years, and the engagement had been broken off, owing to some money difficulties between the gentlemen of the families.</s> <s sid="72" id="alli.c17.s72">Since that she had become somewhat querulous, and was supposed to be uneasy on that subject of her haymaking.</s> <s sid="73" id="alli.c17.s73">Her glass and her maid assured her that her sun shone still as brightly as ever; but her spirit was becoming weary with waiting, and she dreaded lest she should become a terror to all, as was her sister Rosina, or an object of interest to none, as was Margaretta.</s> <s sid="74" id="alli.c17.s74">It was from her especially that this message had been sent to our friend Crosbie; for, during the last spring in London, she and Crosbie had known each other well.</s> <s sid="75" id="alli.c17.s75">Yes, my gentle readers; it is true, as your heart suggests to you.</s> <s sid="76" id="alli.c17.s76">Under such circumstances Mr Crosbie should not have gone to Courcy Castle.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="alli.c17.p8"><s sid="77" id="alli.c17.s77">Such was the family circle of the De Courcys.</s> <s sid="78" id="alli.c17.s78">Among their present guests I need not enumerate many.</s> <s sid="79" id="alli.c17.s79">First and foremost in all respects was Lady Dumbello, of whose parentage and position a few words were said in the last chapter.</s> <s sid="80" id="alli.c17.s80">She was a lady still very young, having as yet been little more than two years married.</s> <s sid="81" id="alli.c17.s81">But in those two years her triumphs had been many--so many, that in the great world her standing already equalled that of her celebrated mother-in-law, the Marchioness of Hartletop, who, for twenty years, had owned no greater potentate than herself in the realms of fashion.</s> <s sid="82" id="alli.c17.s82">But Lady Dumbello was every inch as great as she; and men said, and women also, that the daughter-in-law would soon be the greater.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="alli.c17.p9" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="alli.c17.s83">"I'll be hanged if I can understand how she does it, "a certain noble peer had once said to Crosbie, standing at the door of Sebright's, during the latter days of the last season.</s> <s sid="84" id="alli.c17.s84"><qs/>"She never says anything to any one.</s> <s sid="85" id="alli.c17.s85">She won't speak ten words a whole night through."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="alli.c17.p10" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="alli.c17.s86"><qs/>"I don't think she has an idea in her head,"<qe/> said Crosbie.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="alli.c17.p11" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="alli.c17.s87"><qs/>"Let me tell you that she must be a very clever woman,"<qe/> continued the noble peer.</s> <s sid="88" id="alli.c17.s88"><qs/>"No fool could do as she does.</s> <s sid="89" id="alli.c17.s89">Remember, she's only a parson's daughter; and as for beauty--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="alli.c17.p12" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="alli.c17.s90"><qs/>"I don't admire her for one,"<qe/> said Crosbie.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="alli.c17.p13" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="alli.c17.s91"><qs/>"I don't want to run away with her, if you mean that,"<qe/><sss/> said the peer; <sse/><qs/>"but she is handsome, no doubt.</s> <s sid="92" id="alli.c17.s92">I wonder whether Dumbello likes it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="alli.c17.p14"><s sid="93" id="alli.c17.s93">Dumbello did like it.</s> <s sid="94" id="alli.c17.s94">It satisfied his ambition to be led about as the senior lacquey in his wife's train.</s> <s sid="95" id="alli.c17.s95">He believed himself to be a great man because the world fought for his wife's presence; and considered himself to be distinguished even among the eldest suns of marquises, by the greatness reflected from the parson's daughter whom he had married.</s> <s sid="96" id="alli.c17.s96">He had now been brought to Courcy Castle, and felt himself proud of his situation because Lady Dumbello had made considerable difficulty in according this week to the Countess de Courcy.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="alli.c17.p15" type="speech"><s sid="97" id="alli.c17.s97">And Lady Julia de Guest was already there, the sister of the other old earl, who lived in the next county.</s> <s sid="98" id="alli.c17.s98">She had only arrived on the day before, but had been quick in spreading the news as to Crosbie's engagement.</s> <s sid="99" id="alli.c17.s99"><qs/>"Engaged to one of the Dales, is he?"<qe/> said the countess, with a pretty little smile, which showed plainly that the matter was one of no interest to herself.</s> <s sid="100" id="alli.c17.s100"><qs/>"Has she got any money?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="alli.c17.p16" type="speech"><s sid="101" id="alli.c17.s101"><qs/>"Not a shilling, I should think,"<qe/> said the Lady Julia.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="alli.c17.p17" type="speech"><s sid="102" id="alli.c17.s102"><qs/>"Pretty, I suppose?"<qe/> suggested the countess.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="alli.c17.p18" type="speech"><s sid="103" id="alli.c17.s103"><qs/>"Why, yes; she is pretty--and a nice girl.</s> <s sid="104" id="alli.c17.s104">I don't know whether her mother and uncle were very wise in encouraging Mr Crosbie.</s> <s sid="105" id="alli.c17.s105">I don't hear that he has anything special to recommend him--in the way of money I mean."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="alli.c17.p19" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="alli.c17.s106"><qs/>"I dare say it will come to nothing,"<qe/> said the countess, who liked to hear of girls being engaged and then losing their promised husbands.</s> <s sid="107" id="alli.c17.s107">She did not know that she liked it, but she did; and already had pleasure in anticipating poor Lily's discomfiture.</s> <s sid="108" id="alli.c17.s108">But not the less was she angry with Crosbie, feeling that he was making his way into her house under false pretences.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="alli.c17.p20" type="speech"><s sid="109" id="alli.c17.s109">And Alexandrina also was angry when Lady Julia repeated the same tidings in her hearing <qs/>"I really don't think we care very much about it, Lady Julia,"<qe/> said she, with a little toss of her head."</s> <s sid="110" id="alli.c17.s110">That's three times we've been told of Miss Dale's good fortune."</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="alli.c17.p21" type="speech"><s sid="111" id="alli.c17.s111"><qs/>"The Dales are related to you, I think?"<qe/> said Margaretta.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="alli.c17.p22" type="speech"><s sid="112" id="alli.c17.s112"><qs/>"Not at all,"<qe/> said Lady Julia, bristling up.</s> <s sid="113" id="alli.c17.s113"><qs/>"The lady whom Mr Crosbie proposes to marry is in no way connected with us.</s> <s sid="114" id="alli.c17.s114">Her cousin, who is the heir to the Allington property, is my nephew by his mother."<qe/></s> <s sid="115" id="alli.c17.s115">And then the subject was dropped.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="alli.c17.p23"><s sid="116" id="alli.c17.s116">Crosbie, on his arrival, was shown up into his room, told the hour of dinner, and left to his devices.</s> <s sid="117" id="alli.c17.s117">He had been at the castle before, and knew the ways of the house.</s> <s sid="118" id="alli.c17.s118">So he sat himself down to his table, and began a letter to Lily.</s> <s sid="119" id="alli.c17.s119">But he had not proceeded far, not having as yet indeed made up his mind as to the form in which he would commence it, but was sitting idly with the pen in his hand, thinking of Lily, and thinking also how such houses as this in which he now found himself would be soon closed against him, when there came a rap at his door, and before he could answer the Honourable John entered the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="alli.c17.p24" type="speech"><s sid="120" id="alli.c17.s120"><qs/>"Well, old fellow,"<qe/> said the Honourable John, "how are you?</s> <s sid="121" id="alli.c17.s121">Crosbie had been intimate with John de Courcy, but never felt for him either friendship or liking.</s> <s sid="122" id="alli.c17.s122">Crosbie did not like such men as John de Courcy; but nevertheless, they called each other old fellow, poked each other's ribs, and were very intimate.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="alli.c20.p1"><s sid="1" id="alli.c20.s1">If there was anything in the world as to which Isabella Dale was quite certain, it was this--that she was not in love with Dr Crofts.</s> <s sid="2" id="alli.c20.s2">As to being in love with her cousin Bernard, she had never had occasion to ask herself any question on that head.</s> <s sid="3" id="alli.c20.s3">She liked him very well, but she had never thought of marrying him; and now, when he made his proposal, she could not bring herself to think of it.</s> <s sid="4" id="alli.c20.s4">But as regards Dr Crofts, she had thought of it, and had make up her mind--in the manner above described.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="alli.c20.p2"><s sid="5" id="alli.c20.s5">It may be said that she could not have been justified in discussing the matter even within her own bosom, unless authorised to do so by Dr Crofts himself.</s> <s sid="6" id="alli.c20.s6">Let it then be considered that Dr Crofts had given her some such authority.</s> <s sid="7" id="alli.c20.s7">This may be done in more ways than one; and Miss Dale could not have found herself asking herself questions about him, unless there had been fitting occasion for her to do so.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="alli.c20.p3"><s sid="8" id="alli.c20.s8">The profession of a medical man in a small provincial town is not often one which gives to its owner in early life a large income.</s> <s sid="9" id="alli.c20.s9">Perhaps in no career has a man to work harder for what he earns, or to do more work without earning anything.</s> <s sid="10" id="alli.c20.s10">It has sometimes seemed to me as though the young doctors and the old doctors had agreed to divide between them the different results of their profession--the young doctors doing all the work and the old doctors taking all the money.</s> <s sid="11" id="alli.c20.s11">If this be so it may account for that appearance of premature gravity which is borne by so many of the medical profession.</s> <s sid="12" id="alli.c20.s12">Under such an arrangement a man may be excused for a desire to put away childish things very early in life.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="alli.c20.p4"><s sid="13" id="alli.c20.s13">Dr Crofts had now been practising in Guestwick nearly seven years, having settled himself in that town when he was twenty-three years old, and being at this period about thirty.</s> <s sid="14" id="alli.c20.s14">During those seven years his skill and industry had been so fully admitted that he had succeeded in obtaining the medical care of all the paupers in the union, for which work he was paid at the rate of one hundred pounds a year.</s> <s sid="15" id="alli.c20.s15">He was also assistant-surgeon at a small hospital which was maintained in that town, and held two or three other similar public positions, all of which attested his respectability and general proficiency.</s> <s sid="16" id="alli.c20.s16">They, moreover, thoroughly saved him from any of the dangers of idleness; but, unfortunately, they did not enable him to regard himself as a successful professional man.</s> <s sid="17" id="alli.c20.s17">Whereas old Dr Gruffen, of whom but few people spoke well, had made a fortune in Guestwick, and even still drew from the ailments of the town a considerable and hardly yet decreasing income.</s> <s sid="18" id="alli.c20.s18">Now this was hard upon Dr Crofts--unless there was existing some such well-understood arrangement as that above named.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="alli.c20.p5"><s sid="19" id="alli.c20.s19">He had been known to the family of the Dales long previous to his settlement at Guestwick, and had been very intimate with them from that time to the present day.</s> <s sid="20" id="alli.c20.s20">Of all the men, young or old, whom Mrs Dale counted among her intimate friends, he was the one whom she most trusted and admired.</s> <s sid="21" id="alli.c20.s21">And he was a man to be trusted by those who knew him well.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="alli.c20.p6"><s sid="22" id="alli.c20.s22">He was not bright and always ready, as was Crosbie, nor had he all the practical worldly good sense of Bernard Dale.</s> <s sid="23" id="alli.c20.s23">In mental power I doubt whether he was superior to John Eames--to John Eames, such as he might become when the period of his hobbledehoyhood should have altogether passed away.</s> <s sid="24" id="alli.c20.s24">But Crofts, compared with the other three, as they all were at present, was a man more to be trusted than any of them.</s> <s sid="25" id="alli.c20.s25">And there was, moreover, about him an occasional dash of humour, without which Mrs Dale would hardly have regarded him with that thorough liking which she had for him.</s> <s sid="26" id="alli.c20.s26">But it was a quiet humour, apt to show itself when he had but one friend with him, rather than in general society.</s> <s sid="27" id="alli.c20.s27">Crosbie, on the other hand, would be much more bright among a dozen, than he could with a single companion.</s> <s sid="28" id="alli.c20.s28">Bernard Dale was never bright; and as for Johnny Eames--but in this matter of brightness, Johnny Eames had not yet shown to the world what his character might be.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="alli.c20.p7"><s sid="29" id="alli.c20.s29">It was now two years since Crofts had been called upon for medical advice on behalf of his friend Mrs Dale.</s> <s sid="30" id="alli.c20.s30">She had then been ill for a long period--some two or three months, and Dr Crofts had been frequent in his visits at Allington.</s> <s sid="31" id="alli.c20.s31">At that time he became very intimate with Mrs Dale's daughters, and especially so with the eldest.</s> <s sid="32" id="alli.c20.s32">Young unmarried doctors ought perhaps to be excluded from homes in which there are young ladies.</s> <s sid="33" id="alli.c20.s33">I know, at any rate, that many sage matrons hold very strongly to that opinion, thinking, no doubt, that doctors ought to get themselves married before they venture to begin working for a living.</s> <s sid="34" id="alli.c20.s34">Mrs Dale, perhaps, regarded her own girls as still merely children, for Bell, the elder, was then hardly eighteen; or perhaps she held imprudent and heterodox opinions on this subject; or it may be that she selfishly preferred Dr Crofts, with all the danger to her children, to Dr Gruffen, with all the danger to herself.</s> <s sid="35" id="alli.c20.s35">But the result was that the young doctor one day informed himself, as he was riding back to Guestwick, that much of his happiness in this world would depend on his being able to marry Mrs Dale's eldest daughter.</s> <s sid="36" id="alli.c20.s36">At that time his total income amounted to little more than two hundred a year, and he had resolved within his own mind that Dr Gruffen was esteemed as much the better doctor by the general public opinion of Guestwick, and that Dr Gruffen's sandy-haired assistant would even have a better chance of success in the town than himself, should it ever come to pass that the doctor was esteemed too old for personal practice.</s> <s sid="37" id="alli.c20.s37">Crofts had no fortune of his own, and he was aware that Miss Dale had none.</s> <s sid="38" id="alli.c20.s38">Then, under those circumstances, what was he to do?</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="alli.c20.p8"><s sid="39" id="alli.c20.s39">It is not necessary that we should inquire at any great length into those love passages of the doctor's life which took place three years before the commencement of this narrative.</s> <s sid="40" id="alli.c20.s40">He made no declaration to Bell; but Bell, young as she was, understood well that he would fain have done so, had not his courage failed him, or rather had not his prudence prevented him.</s> <s sid="41" id="alli.c20.s41">To Mrs Dale he did speak, not openly avowing his love even to her, but hinting at it, and then talking to her of his unsatisfied hopes and professional disappointments.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="alli.c20.p9" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="alli.c20.s42"><qs/>"It is not that I complain of being poor as I am,"<qe/><sss/> said he <sse/><qs/>"or at any rate, not so poor that my poverty must be any source of discomfort to me; but I could hardly marry with such an income as I have at present."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="alli.c20.p10" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="alli.c20.s43"><qs/>"But it will increase, will it not?"<qe/> said Mrs Dale.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="alli.c20.p12"><s sid="46" id="alli.c20.s46">Mrs Dale could not tell him that, as far as her voice in the matter went, he was welcome to woo her daughter and marry her, poor as he was, and doubly poor as they would both be together on such a pittance.</s> <s sid="47" id="alli.c20.s47">He had not even mentioned Bell's name, and had he done so she could only have bade him wait and hope.</s> <s sid="48" id="alli.c20.s48">After that he said nothing further to her upon the subject.</s> <s sid="49" id="alli.c20.s49">To Bell he spoke no word of overt love; but on an autumn day, when Mrs Dale was already convalescent, and the repetition of his professional visits had become unnecessary, he got her to walk with him through the half-hidden shrubbery paths, and then told her things which he should never have told her, if he really wished to bind her heart to his.</s> <s sid="50" id="alli.c20.s50">He repeated that story of his income, and explained to her that his poverty was only grievous to him in that it prevented him from thinking of marriage.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="alli.c20.p13" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="alli.c20.s51"><qs/>"I suppose it must,"<qe/> said Bell.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="alli.c20.p14" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="alli.c20.s52"><qs/>"I should think it wrong to ask any lady to share such an income as mine,"<qe/> said he.</s> <s sid="53" id="alli.c20.s53">Whereupon Bell had suggested to him that some ladies had incomes of their own, and that he might in that way get over the difficulty.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="alli.c20.p15" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="alli.c20.s54"><qs/>"I should be afraid of myself in marrying a girl with money,"<qe/><sss/> said he; <sse/><qs/>"besides, that is altogether out of the question now."<qe/></s> <s sid="55" id="alli.c20.s55">Of course Bell did not ask him why it was out of the question, and for a time they went on walking in silence.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="alli.c20.p16" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="alli.c20.s56"><qs/>"It is a hard thing to do,"<qe/> he then said--not looking at her, but looking at the gravel on which he stood.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="alli.c20.p17" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="alli.c20.s57"><qs/>"It is a hard thing to do, but I will determine to think of it no further.</s> <s sid="58" id="alli.c20.s58">I believe a man may be as happy single as he may married--almost."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="alli.c20.p18" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="alli.c20.s59"><qs/>"Perhaps more so,"<qe/> said Bell.</s> <s sid="60" id="alli.c20.s60">Then the doctor left her, and Bell, as I have said before, made up her mind with great firmness that she was not in love with him.</s> <s sid="61" id="alli.c20.s61">I may certainly say that there was nothing in the world as to which she was so certain as she was of this.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="alli.c20.p19"><s sid="62" id="alli.c20.s62">And now, in these days, Dr Crofts did not come over to Allington very often.</s> <s sid="63" id="alli.c20.s63">Had any of the family in the Small House been ill, he would have been there of course.</s> <s sid="64" id="alli.c20.s64">The squire himself employed the apothecary in the village, or if higher aid was needed, would send for Dr Gruffen.</s> <s sid="65" id="alli.c20.s65">On the occasion of Mrs Dale's party, Crofts was there, having been specially invited; but Mrs Dale's special invitations to her friends were very few, and the doctor was well aware that he must himself make occasion for going there if he desired to see the inmates of the house.</s> <s sid="66" id="alli.c20.s66">But he very rarely made such occasion, perhaps feeling that he was more in his element at the workhouse and the hospital.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="alli.c25.p4"><s sid="22" id="alli.c25.s22">As he sat in the train, with a newspaper in his hand, he went on acknowledging to himself that he was a villain.</s> <s sid="23" id="alli.c25.s23">Lady Julia had spoken the truth to him on the stairs at Courcy, and so he confessed over and over again.</s> <s sid="24" id="alli.c25.s24">But he was chiefly angry with himself for this--that he had been a villain without gaining anything by his villany; that he had been a villain, and was to lose so much by his villany.</s> <s sid="25" id="alli.c25.s25">He made comparison between Lily and Alexandrina, and owned to himself, over and over again, that Lily would make the best wife that a man could take to his boom.</s> <s sid="26" id="alli.c25.s26">As to Alexandrina, he knew the thinness of her character.</s> <s sid="27" id="alli.c25.s27">She would stick by him, no doubt; and in a circuitous, discontented, unhappy way, would probably be true to her duties as a wife and mother.</s> <s sid="28" id="alli.c25.s28">She would be nearly such another as Lady Amelia Gazebee.</s> <s sid="29" id="alli.c25.s29">But was that a prize sufficiently rich to make him contented with his own prowess and skill in winning it?</s> <s sid="30" id="alli.c25.s30">And was that a prize sufficiently rich to justify him to himself for his terrible villany?</s> <s sid="31" id="alli.c25.s31">Lily Dale he had loved; and he now declared to himself that he could have continued to love her through his whole life.</s> <s sid="32" id="alli.c25.s32">But what was there for any man to love in Alexandrina de Courcy?</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="alli.c25.p5"><s sid="33" id="alli.c25.s33">While resolving, during his first four or five days at the castle, that he would throw Lily Dale overboard, he had contrived to quiet his conscience by inward allusions to sundry heroes of romance.</s> <s sid="34" id="alli.c25.s34">He had thought of Lothario, Don Juan, and of Lovelace; and had told himself that the world had ever been full of such heroes.</s> <s sid="35" id="alli.c25.s35">And the world, too, had treated such heroes well; not punishing them at all as villains, but caressing them rather, and calling them curled darlings.</s> <s sid="36" id="alli.c25.s36">Why should not he be a curled darling as well as another?</s> <s sid="37" id="alli.c25.s37">Ladies had ever been fond of the Don Juan character, and Don Juan had generally been popular with men also.</s> <s sid="38" id="alli.c25.s38">And then he named to himself a dozen modern Lotharios--men who were holding their heads well above water, although it was known that they had played this lady false, and brought that other one to death's door, or perhaps even to death itself.</s> <s sid="39" id="alli.c25.s39">War and love were alike, and the world was prepared to forgive any guile to militants in either camp.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="alli.c25.p6"><s sid="40" id="alli.c25.s40">But now that he had done the deed he found himself forced to look at it from quite another point of view.</s> <s sid="41" id="alli.c25.s41">Suddenly that character of Lothario showed itself to him in a different light, and one in which it did not please him to look at it as belonging to himself.</s> <s sid="42" id="alli.c25.s42">He began to feel that it would be almost impossible for him to write that letter to Lily, which it was absolutely necessary that he should write.</s> <s sid="43" id="alli.c25.s43">He was in a position in which his mind would almost turn itself to thoughts of self-destruction as the only means of escape.</s> <s sid="44" id="alli.c25.s44">A fortnight ago he was a happy man, having everything before him that a man ought to want; and now--now that he was the accepted son-in-law of an earl, and the confident expectant of high promotion--he was the most miserable, degraded wretch in the world!</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="alli.c25.p7"><s sid="45" id="alli.c25.s45">He changed his clothes at his lodgings in Mount Street and went down to his club to dinner.</s> <s sid="46" id="alli.c25.s46">He could, at any rate, do nothing that night.</s> <s sid="47" id="alli.c25.s47">His letter to Allington must, no doubt, be written at once; but, as he could not send it before the next night's post, he was not forced to set to work upon it that evening.</s> <s sid="48" id="alli.c25.s48">As he walked along Piccadilly on his way to St.</s> <s sid="49" id="alli.c25.s49">James's Square, it occurred to him that it might be well to write a short line to Lily, telling her nothing of the truth--a note written as though his engagement with her was still unbroken, but yet written with care, saying nothing about that engagement, so as to give him a little time.</s> <s sid="50" id="alli.c25.s50">Then he thought that he would telegraph to Bernard and tell everything to him.</s> <s sid="51" id="alli.c25.s51">Bernard would, of course, be prepared to avenge his cousin in some way, but for such vengeance Crosbie felt that he should care little.</s> <s sid="52" id="alli.c25.s52">Lady Julia had told him that Lily was without father or brother, thereby accusing him of the basest cowardice.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="alli.c28.p2"><s sid="3" id="alli.c28.s3">He went early to his office, knowing that he had before him the work of writing two letters, neither of which would run very glibly from his pen.</s> <s sid="4" id="alli.c28.s4">One was to be his missive to the squire, to be delivered by his friend; the other, that fatal epistle to poor Lily, which, as the day passed away, he found himself utterly unable to accomplish.</s> <s sid="5" id="alli.c28.s5">The letter to the squire he did write, under certain threats; and, as we have seen, was considered to have degraded himself to the vermin rank of humanity by the meanness of his production.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="alli.c28.p3"><s sid="6" id="alli.c28.s6">But on reaching his office he found that other cares awaited him--cares which he would have taken much delight in bearing, had the state of his mind enabled him to take delight in anything.</s> <s sid="7" id="alli.c28.s7">On entering the lobby of his office, at ten o'clock, he became aware that he was received by the messengers assembled there with almost more than their usual deference.</s> <s sid="8" id="alli.c28.s8">He was always a great man at the General Committee Office; but there are shades of greatness and shades of deference, which, though quite beyond the powers of definition, nevertheless manifest themselves clearly to the experienced ear and eye.</s> <s sid="9" id="alli.c28.s9">He walked through to his own apartment, and there found two official letters addressed to him lying on his table.</s> <s sid="10" id="alli.c28.s10">The first which came to hand, though official, was small, and marked private, and it was addressed in the handwriting of his old friend, Butterwell, the outgoing secretary.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="alli.c44.p1"><s sid="1" id="alli.c44.s1">Lily had exacted a promise from her mother before her illness, and during the period of her convalescence often referred to it, reminding her mother that that promise had been made, and must be kept.</s> <s sid="2" id="alli.c44.s2">Lily was to be told the day on which Crosbie was to be married.</s> <s sid="3" id="alli.c44.s3">It had come to the knowledge of them all that the marriage was to take place in February.</s> <s sid="4" id="alli.c44.s4">But this was not sufficient for Lily.</s> <s sid="5" id="alli.c44.s5">She must know the day.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="alli.c44.p2"><s sid="6" id="alli.c44.s6">And as the time drew nearer--Lily becoming stronger the while, and less subject to medical authority--the marriage of Crosbie and Alexandrina was spoken of much more frequently at the Small House.</s> <s sid="7" id="alli.c44.s7">It was not a subject which Mrs Dale or Bell would have chosen for conversation; but Lily would refer to it.</s> <s sid="8" id="alli.c44.s8">She would begin by doing so almost in a drolling strain, alluding to herself as a forlorn damsel in a play-book; and then she would go on to speak of his interests as a matter which was still of great moment to her.</s> <s sid="9" id="alli.c44.s9">But in the course of such talking she would too often break down, showing by some sad word or melancholy tone how great was the burden on her heart.</s> <s sid="10" id="alli.c44.s10">Mrs Dale and Bell would willingly have avoided the subject, but Lily would not have it avoided.</s> <s sid="11" id="alli.c44.s11">For them it was a very difficult matter on which to speak in her hearing.</s> <s sid="12" id="alli.c44.s12">It was not permitted to them to say a word of abuse against Crosbie, as to whom they thought that no word of condemnation could be sufficiently severe; and they were forced to listen to such excuses for his conduct as Lily chose to manufacture, never daring to point out how vain those excuses were.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="alli.c44.p3"><s sid="13" id="alli.c44.s13">Indeed, in those days Lily reigned as a queen at the Small House. ill-usage and illness together falling into her hands had given her such power, that none of the other women were able to withstand it.</s> <s sid="14" id="alli.c44.s14">Nothing was said about it; but it was understood by them all, Jane and the cook included, that Lily was for the time paramount.</s> <s sid="15" id="alli.c44.s15">She was a dear, gracious, loving, brave queen, and no one was anxious to rebel--only that those praises of Crosbie were so very bitter in the ears of her subjects.</s> <s sid="16" id="alli.c44.s16">The day was named soon enough, and the tidings came down to Allington.</s> <s sid="17" id="alli.c44.s17">On the fourteenth of February, Crosbie was to be made a happy man.</s> <s sid="18" id="alli.c44.s18">This was not known to the Dales till the twelfth, and they would willingly have spared the knowledge then, had it been possible to spare it.</s> <s sid="19" id="alli.c44.s19">But it was not so, and on that evening Lily was told.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER XLV VALENTINE'S DAY IN LONDON</title>

<p pid="1" id="alli.c45.p1"><s sid="1" id="alli.c45.s1">The fourteenth of February in London was quite as black, and cold, and as wintersome as it was at Allington, and was, perhaps, somewhat more melancholy in its coldness.</s> <s sid="2" id="alli.c45.s2">Nevertheless Lady Alexandrina de Courcy looked as bright as bridal finery could make her, when she got out of her carriage and walked into St.</s> <s sid="3" id="alli.c45.s3">James's church at eleven o'clock on that morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="alli.c45.p2"><s sid="4" id="alli.c45.s4">It had been finally arranged that the marriage should take place in London.</s> <s sid="5" id="alli.c45.s5">There were certainly many reasons which would have made a marriage from Courcy Castle more convenient.</s> <s sid="6" id="alli.c45.s6">The De Courcy family were all assembled at their country family residence, and could therefore have been present at the ceremony without cost or trouble.</s> <s sid="7" id="alli.c45.s7">The castle too was warm with the warmth of life, and the pleasantness of home would have lent a grace to the departure of one of the daughters of the house.</s> <s sid="8" id="alli.c45.s8">The retainers and servants were there, and something of the rich mellowness of a noble alliance might have been felt, at any rate by Crosbie, at a marriage so celebrated.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="alli.c45.p3"><s sid="9" id="alli.c45.s9">And it must have been acknowledged, even by Lady de Courcy, that the house in Portman Square was very cold--that a marriage from thence would be cold--that there could be no hope of attaching to it any honour and glory, or of making it resound with fashionable clat in the columns of the Morning Post.</s> <s sid="10" id="alli.c45.s10">But then, had they been married in the country, the earl would have been there; whereas there was no probability of his travelling up to London for the purpose of being present on such an occasion.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="alli.c45.p4"><s sid="11" id="alli.c45.s11">The earl was very terrible in these days, and Alexandrina, as she became confidential in her communications with her future husband, spoke of him as of an ogre, who could not by any means be avoided in all the concerns of life, but whom one might shun now and again by some subtle device and careful arrangement of favourable circumstances.</s> <s sid="12" id="alli.c45.s12">Crosbie had more than once taken upon himself to hint that he did not specially regard the ogre, seeing that for the future he could keep himself altogether apart from the malicious monster's dominions.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="alli.c45.p5" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="alli.c45.s13"><qs/>"He will not come to me in our new home,"<qe/> he had said to his love, with some little touch of affection.</s> <s sid="14" id="alli.c45.s14">But to this view of the case Lady Alexandrina had demurred.</s> <s sid="15" id="alli.c45.s15">The ogre in question was not only her parent, but was also a noble peer, and she could not agree to any arrangement by which their future connection with the earl, and with nobility in general, might be endangered.</s> <s sid="16" id="alli.c45.s16">Her parent, doubtless, was an ogre, and in his ogreship could make himself very terrible to those near him; but then might it not be better for them to be near to an earl who was an ogre, than not to be near to any earl at all?</s> <s sid="17" id="alli.c45.s17">She had therefore signified to Crosbie that the ogre must be endured.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="alli.c45.p6"><s sid="18" id="alli.c45.s18">But, nevertheless, it was a great thing to be rid of him on that happy occasion.</s> <s sid="19" id="alli.c45.s19">He would have said very dreadful things--things so dreadful that there might have been a question whether the bridegroom could have borne them.</s> <s sid="20" id="alli.c45.s20">Since he had heard of Crosbie's accident at the railway station, he had constantly talked with fiendish glee of the beating which had been administered to his son-in-law.</s> <s sid="21" id="alli.c45.s21">Lady de Courcy in taking Crosbie's part, and maintaining that the match was fitting for her daughter, had ventured to declare before her husband that Crosbie was a man of fashion, and the earl would now ask, with a loathsome grin, whether the bridegroom's fashion had been improved by his little adventure at Paddington.</s> <s sid="22" id="alli.c45.s22">Crosbie, to whom all this was not repeated, would have preferred a wedding in the country.</s> <s sid="23" id="alli.c45.s23">But the countess and Lady Alexandrina knew better.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="alli.c45.p7" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="alli.c45.s24">The earl had strictly interdicted any expenditure, and the countess had of necessity construed this as forbidding any unnecessary expense.</s> <s sid="25" id="alli.c45.s25"><qs/>"To marry a girl without any immediate cost was a thing which nobody could understand,"<qe/> as the countess remarked to her eldest daughter.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="alli.c45.p9"><s sid="34" id="alli.c45.s34">To this Crosbie had assented very willingly, though he had not relished the manner in which the countess had explained to him her views.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="alli.c45.p23"><s sid="56" id="alli.c45.s56">Mr Gazebee, who also had had his own experiences, hardly dared to hope so much.</s> <s sid="57" id="alli.c45.s57">His home had been satisfactory to him, because he had been a calculating man, and having made his calculation correctly was willing to take the net result.</s> <s sid="58" id="alli.c45.s58">He had done so all his life with success.</s> <s sid="59" id="alli.c45.s59">In his house his wife was paramount--as he very well knew.</s> <s sid="60" id="alli.c45.s60">But no effort on his wife's part, had she wished to make such effort, could have forced him to spend more than two-thirds of his income.</s> <s sid="61" id="alli.c45.s61">Of this she also was aware, and had trimmed her sails accordingly, likening herself to him in this respect.</s> <s sid="62" id="alli.c45.s62">But of such wisdom, and such trimmings, and such adaptability, what likelihood was there with Mr Crosbie and Lady Alexandrina?</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER LIX JOHN EAMES BECOMES A MAN Eames, when he was half way up to London in the railway carriage took out from his pocket a letter and read it. During the former portion of his journey he had been thinking of other things; but gradually he had resolved that it would be better for him not to think more of those other things for the present, and therefore he had recourse to his letter by way of dissipating his thoughts.

<p pid="1" id="alli.c61.p1"><s sid="1" id="alli.c61.s1">It was early in June that Lily went up to her uncle at the Great House, pleading for Hopkins--pleading that to Hopkins might be restored all the privileges of head gardener at the Great House.</s> <s sid="2" id="alli.c61.s2">There was some absurdity in this, seeing that he had never really relinquished his privileges; but the manner of the quarrel had been in this wise.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="alli.c61.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="alli.c61.s3">There was in those days, and had been for years, a vexed question between Hopkins and Jolliffe the bailiff on the matter of stable manure.</s> <s sid="4" id="alli.c61.s4">Hopkins had pretended to the right of taking what he required from the farmyard, without asking leave of any one.</s> <s sid="5" id="alli.c61.s5">Jolliffe in return had hinted, that if this were so, Hopkins would take it all.</s> <s sid="6" id="alli.c61.s6"><qs/>"But I can't eat it,"<qe/> Hopkins had said.</s> <s sid="7" id="alli.c61.s7">Jolliffe merely grunted, signifying by the grunt, as Hopkins thought, that though a gardener couldn't eat a mountain of manure fifty feet long and fifteen high--couldn't eat in the body--he might convert it into things edible for his own personal use.</s> <s sid="8" id="alli.c61.s8">And so there had been a great feud.</s> <s sid="9" id="alli.c61.s9">The unfortunate squire had of course been called on to arbitrate, and having postponed his decision by every contrivance possible to him, had at last been driven by Jolliffe to declare that Hopkins should take nothing that was not assigned to him.</s> <s sid="10" id="alli.c61.s10">Hopkins, when the decision was made known to him by his master, bit his old lips, and turned round upon his old heel, speechless.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="alli.c61.p3" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="alli.c61.s11"><qs/>"You'll find it's so at all other places,"<qe/> said the squire, apologetically.</s> <s sid="12" id="alli.c61.s12"><qs/>"Other places!"<qe/> sneered Hopkins.</s> <s sid="13" id="alli.c61.s13">Where would he find other gardeners like himself?</s> <s sid="14" id="alli.c61.s14">It is hardly necessary to declare that from that moment he resolved that he would abide by no such order.</s> <s sid="15" id="alli.c61.s15">Jolliffe on the next morning informed the squire that the order had been broken, and the squire fretted and fumed, wishing that Jolliffe were well buried under the mountain in question.</s> <s sid="16" id="alli.c61.s16"><qs/>"If they all is to do as they like,"<qe/><sss/> said Jolliffe, <sse/><qs/>"then nobody won't care for nobody."<qe/></s> <s sid="17" id="alli.c61.s17">The squire understood than an order if given must be obeyed, and therefore, with many inner groanings of the spirit, resolved that war must be waged against Hopkins.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="alli.c61.p4"><s sid="18" id="alli.c61.s18">On the following morning he found the old man himself wheeling a huge barrow of manure round from the yard into the kitchen-garden.</s> <s sid="19" id="alli.c61.s19">Now, on ordinary occasions, Hopkins was not required to do with his own hands work of that description.</s> <s sid="20" id="alli.c61.s20">He had a man under him who hewed wood, and carried water, and wheeled barrows--one man always, and often two.</s> <s sid="21" id="alli.c61.s21">The squire knew when he saw him that he was sinning, and bade him stop upon his road.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="alli.c61.p5" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="alli.c61.s22"><qs/>"Hopkins,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"why didn't you ask for what you wanted, before you took it?"<qe/></s> <s sid="23" id="alli.c61.s23">The old man put down the barrow on the ground, looked up in his master's face, spat into his hands, and then again resumed his barrow.</s> <s sid="24" id="alli.c61.s24"><qs/>"Hopkins, that won't do,"<qe/> said the squire.</s> <s sid="25" id="alli.c61.s25"><qs/>"Stop where you are."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="alli.c61.p6" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="alli.c61.s26"><qs/>"What won't do?"<qe/> said Hopkins, still holding the barrow from the ground, but not as yet progressing.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="alli.c61.p7" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="alli.c61.s27"><qs/>"Put it down, Hopkins,"<qe/> and Hopkins did put it down.</s> <s sid="28" id="alli.c61.s28">Don't you know that you are flatly disobeying my orders?"</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="alli.c61.p8" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="alli.c61.s29"><qs/>"Squire, I've been here about this place going on nigh seventy years."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="alli.c61.p9" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="alli.c61.s30"><qs/>"If you've been going on a hundred and seventy it wouldn't do that there should be more than one master.</s> <s sid="31" id="alli.c61.s31">I'm the master here, and I intend to be so to the end.</s> <s sid="32" id="alli.c61.s32">Take that manure back into the yard."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="alli.c61.p10" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="alli.c61.s33"><qs/>"Back into the yard?"<qe/> said Hopkins, very slowly.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="alli.c61.p11" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="alli.c61.s34"><qs/>"Yes; back into the yard."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="alli.c61.p12" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="alli.c61.s35"><qs/>"What--afore all their faces?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="alli.c61.p13" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="alli.c61.s36"><qs/>"Yes; you've disobeyed me before all their faces?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="alli.c61.p14"><s sid="37" id="alli.c61.s37">Hopkins paused a moment, looking away from the squire, and shaking his head as though he had need of deep thought, but by the aid of deep thought had come at last to a right conclusion.</s> <s sid="38" id="alli.c61.s38">Then he resumed the barrow, and putting himself almost into a trot, carried away his prize into the kitchen-garden.</s> <s sid="39" id="alli.c61.s39">At the pace which he went it would have been beyond the squire's power to stop him, nor would Mr Dale have wished to come to a personal encounter with his servant.</s> <s sid="40" id="alli.c61.s40">But he called after the man in dire wrath that if he were not obeyed the disobedient servant should rue the consequences for ever.</s> <s sid="41" id="alli.c61.s41">Hopkins, equal to the occasion, shook his head as he trotted on, deposited his load at the foot of the cucumber-frames, and then at once returning to his master, tendered to him the key of the greenhouse.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="alli.c61.p15" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="alli.c61.s42"><qs/>"Master,"<qe/><sls/> said Hopkins, speaking as best he could with his scanty breath, <sle/><qs/>"there it is--there's the key; of course I don't want no warning, and doesn't care about my week's wages.</s> <s sid="43" id="alli.c61.s43">I'll be out of the cottage afore night, and as for the work'us, I suppose they'll let me in at once, if your honour'll give 'em a line."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="alli.c61.p16"><s sid="44" id="alli.c61.s44">Now as Hopkins was well known by the squire to be the owner of three or four hundred pounds, the hint about the workhouse must be allowed to have been melodramatic.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="alli.c61.p17" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="alli.c61.s45"><qs/>"Don't be a fool,"<qe/> said the squire, almost gnashing his teeth.</s> <s sid="46" id="alli.c61.s46"><qs/>"I know I've been a fool,"<qe/><sss/> said Hopkins, <sse/><qs/>"about that 'ere doong; my feelings has been too much for me.</s> <s sid="47" id="alli.c61.s47">When a man's feelings has been too much for him, he'd better just take hisself off, and lie in the work'us till he dies."<qe/></s> <s sid="48" id="alli.c61.s48">And then he again tendered the key.</s> <s sid="49" id="alli.c61.s49">But the squire did not take the key, and so Hopkins went on.</s> <s sid="50" id="alli.c61.s50"><qs/>"I s'pose I'd better just see to the lights and the like of that, till you've suited yourself, Mr Dale.</s> <s sid="51" id="alli.c61.s51">It 'ud be a pity all them grapes should go off, and they, as you may say, all one as fit for the table.</s> <s sid="52" id="alli.c61.s52">It's a long way the best crop I ever see on 'em.</s> <s sid="53" id="alli.c61.s53">I've been that careful with 'em that I haven't had a natural night's rest, not since February.</s> <s sid="54" id="alli.c61.s54">There ain't nobody about this place as understands grapes, nor yet anywhere nigh that could be got at.</s> <s sid="55" id="alli.c61.s55">My lord's head man is wery ignorant; but even if he knew ever so, of course he couldn't come here.</s> <s sid="56" id="alli.c61.s56">I suppose I'd better keep the key till you're suited, Mr Dale."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="alli.c61.p18"><s sid="57" id="alli.c61.s57">Then for a fortnight there was an interregnum in the gardens, terrible in the annals of Allington.</s> <s sid="58" id="alli.c61.s58">Hopkins lived in his cottage indeed, and looked most sedulously after the grapes.</s> <s sid="59" id="alli.c61.s59">In looking after the grapes, too, he took the greenhouses under his care; but he would have nothing to do with the outer gardens, took no wages, returning the amount sent to him back to the squire, and insisted with everybody that he had been dismissed.</s> <s sid="60" id="alli.c61.s60">He went about with some terrible horticultural implement always in his hand, with which it was said that he intended to attack Jolliffe; but Jolliffe prudently kept out of his way.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="alli.c61.p19"><s sid="61" id="alli.c61.s61">As soon as it had been resolved by Mrs Dale and Lily that the flitting from the Small House at Allington was not to be accomplished, Lily communicated the fact to Hopkins.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="alli.c61.p20" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="alli.c61.s62"><qs/>"Miss,"<qe/><sss/> said he, <sse/><qs/>"when I said them few words to you and your mamma, I knew that you would listen to reason."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="alli.c61.p21"><s sid="63" id="alli.c61.s63">This was no more than Lily had expected; that Hopkins should claim the honour of having prevailed by his arguments was a matter of course.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="alli.c61.p22" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="alli.c61.s64"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/><sss/> said Lily; <sse/><qs/>"we've made up our minds to stay.</s> <s sid="65" id="alli.c61.s65">Uncle wishes it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="alli.c61.p24" type="speech" form="extended" position="beginning"><s sid="71" id="alli.c61.s71"><qs/>"But, Hopkins, it's decided.</s> <s sid="72" id="alli.c61.s72">We're going to stay.</s> <s sid="73" id="alli.c61.s73">What I want to know is this; can you come at once and help me to unpack?</s> </p><p pid="25" id="alli.c61.p25" type="speech" form="extended" position="end"><s sid="74" id="alli.c61.s74">"What! this very evening, as is--"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="26" id="alli.c61.p26" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="alli.c61.s75"><qs/>"Yes, now; we want to have the things about again before they come back from Guestwick."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="alli.c61.p27" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="alli.c61.s76">Hopkins scratched his head and hesitated, not wishing to yield to any proposition that could be considered as childish; but he gave way at last, feeling that the work itself was a good work.</s> <s sid="77" id="alli.c61.s77">Mrs Dale also assented, laughing at Lily for her folly as she did so, and in this way the things were unpacked very quickly, and the alliance between Lily and Hopkins became, for the time, very close.</s> <s sid="78" id="alli.c61.s78">This work of unpacking and resettling was not yet over, when the battle of the manure broke out, and therefore it was that Hopkins, when his feelings had become altogether too much for him <qs/>"about the doong,"<qe/> came at last to Lily, and laying down at her feet all the weight and all the glory of his sixty odd years of life, implored her to make matters straight for him.</s> <s sid="79" id="alli.c61.s79"><qs/>"It's been a killing me, miss, so it has; to see the way they've been a cutting that 'sparagus.</s> <s sid="80" id="alli.c61.s80">It ain't cutting at all.</s> <s sid="81" id="alli.c61.s81">It's just hocking it up--what is fit, and what isn't, all together.</s> <s sid="82" id="alli.c61.s82">And they've been a-putting the plants in where I didn't mean 'em, though they know'd I didn't mean 'em.</s> <s sid="83" id="alli.c61.s83">I've stood by, miss, and said never a word.</s> <s sid="84" id="alli.c61.s84">I'd a died sooner.</s> <s sid="85" id="alli.c61.s85">But, Miss Lily, what my sufferings have been, 'cause of my feelings getting the better of me about that--you know, miss--nobody will ever tell--nobody--nobody--nobody."<qe/></s> <s sid="86" id="alli.c61.s86">Then Hopkins turned away and wept.</s> </p>
