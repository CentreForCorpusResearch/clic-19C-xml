<stru>Vanity Fair by William Makepeace Thackeray</stru>







BEFORE THE CURTAIN





As the manager of the Performance sits before the curtain on the

boards and looks into the Fair, a feeling of profound melancholy

comes over him in his survey of the bustling place. There is a great

quantity of eating and drinking, making love and jilting, laughing

and the contrary, smoking, cheating, fighting, dancing and fiddling;

there are bullies pushing about, bucks ogling the women, knaves

picking pockets, policemen on the look-out, quacks (OTHER quacks,

plague take them!) bawling in front of their booths, and yokels

looking up at the tinselled dancers and poor old rouged tumblers,

while the light-fingered folk are operating upon their pockets

behind. Yes, this is VANITY FAIR; not a moral place certainly; nor a

merry one, though very noisy.  Look at the faces of the actors and

buffoons when they come off from their business; and Tom Fool

washing the paint off his cheeks before he sits down to dinner with

his wife and the little Jack Puddings behind the canvas.   The

curtain will be up presently, and he will be turning over head and

heels, and crying, "How are you?"



A man with a reflective turn of mind, walking through an exhibition

of this sort, will not be oppressed, I take it, by his own or other

people's hilarity.   An episode of humour or kindness touches and

amuses him here and there--a pretty child looking at a gingerbread

stall; a pretty girl blushing whilst her lover talks to her and

chooses her fairing; poor Tom Fool, yonder behind the waggon,

mumbling his bone with the honest family which lives by his

tumbling; but the general impression is one more melancholy than

mirthful.  When you come home you sit down in a sober,

contemplative, not uncharitable frame of mind, and apply yourself to

your books or your business.



I have no other moral than this to tag to the present story of

"Vanity Fair." Some people consider Fairs immoral altogether, and

eschew such, with their servants and families: very likely they are

right.  But persons who think otherwise, and are of a lazy, or a

benevolent, or a sarcastic mood, may perhaps like to step in for

half an hour, and look at the performances. There are scenes of all

sorts; some dreadful combats, some grand and lofty horse-riding,

some scenes of high life, and some of very middling indeed; some

love-making for the sentimental, and some light comic business; the

whole accompanied by appropriate scenery and brilliantly illuminated

with the Author's own candles.



What more has the Manager of the Performance to say?--To acknowledge

the kindness with which it has been received in all the principal

towns of England through which the Show has passed, and where it has

been most favourably noticed by the respected conductors of the

public Press, and by the Nobility and Gentry.  He is proud to think

that his Puppets have given satisfaction to the very best company in

this empire.  The famous little Becky Puppet has been pronounced to

be uncommonly flexible in the joints, and lively on the wire; the

Amelia Doll, though it has had a smaller circle of admirers, has yet

been carved and dressed with the greatest care by the artist; the

Dobbin Figure, though apparently clumsy, yet dances in a very

amusing and natural manner; the Little Boys' Dance has been liked by

some; and please to remark the richly dressed figure of the Wicked

Nobleman, on which no expense has been spared, and which Old Nick

will fetch away at the end of this singular performance.



And with this, and a profound bow to his patrons, the Manager

retires, and the curtain rises.

<title>CHAPTER I Chiswick Mall</title>

<p pid="1" id="vanity.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="vanity.c1.s1">While the present century was in its teens, and on one sunshiny morning in June, there drove up to the great iron gate of Miss Pinkerton's academy for young ladies, on Chiswick Mall, a large family coach, with two fat horses in blazing harness, driven by a fat coachman in a three-cornered hat and wig, at the rate of four miles an hour.</s> <s sid="2" id="vanity.c1.s2">A black servant, who reposed on the box beside the fat coachman, uncurled his bandy legs as soon as the equipage drew up opposite Miss Pinkerton's shining brass plate, and as he pulled the bell at least a score of young heads were seen peering out of the narrow windows of the stately old brick house.</s> <s sid="3" id="vanity.c1.s3">Nay, the acute observer might have recognized the little red nose of good-natured Miss Jemima Pinkerton herself, rising over some geranium pots in the window of that lady's own drawing-room.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vanity.c1.p2" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="vanity.c1.s4"><qs/>"It is Mrs. Sedley's coach, sister,"<qe/> said Miss Jemima.</s> <s sid="5" id="vanity.c1.s5"><qs/>"Sambo, the black servant, has just rung the bell; and the coachman has a new red waistcoat."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vanity.c1.p3" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="vanity.c1.s6"><qs/>"Have you completed all the necessary preparations incident to Miss Sedley's departure, Miss Jemima?"<qe/> asked Miss Pinkerton herself, that majestic lady; the Semiramis of Hammersmith, the friend of Doctor Johnson, the correspondent of Mrs. Chapone herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="vanity.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="vanity.c1.s7"><qs/>"The girls were up at four this morning, packing her trunks, sister,"<qe/><sss/> replied Miss Jemima; <sse/><qs/>"we have made her a bow-pot."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="vanity.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="vanity.c1.s8"><qs/>"Say a bouquet, sister Jemima, 'tis more genteel."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="vanity.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="vanity.c1.s9"><qs/>"Well, a booky as big almost as a haystack; I have put up two bottles of the gillyflower water for Mrs. Sedley, and the receipt for making it, in Amelia's box."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="vanity.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="vanity.c1.s10"><qs/>"And I trust, Miss Jemima, you have made a copy of Miss Sedley's account.</s> <s sid="11" id="vanity.c1.s11">This is it, is it?</s> <s sid="12" id="vanity.c1.s12">Very good--ninety-three pounds, four shillings.</s> <s sid="13" id="vanity.c1.s13">Be kind enough to address it to John Sedley, Esquire, and to seal this billet which I have written to his lady."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="vanity.c1.p8"><s sid="14" id="vanity.c1.s14">In Miss Jemima's eyes an autograph letter of her sister, Miss Pinkerton, was an object of as deep veneration as would have been a letter from a sovereign.</s> <s sid="15" id="vanity.c1.s15">Only when her pupils quitted the establishment, or when they were about to be married, and once, when poor Miss Birch died of the scarlet fever, was Miss Pinkerton known to write personally to the parents of her pupils; and it was Jemima's opinion that if anything could console Mrs. Birch for her daughter's loss, it would be that pious and eloquent composition in which Miss Pinkerton announced the event.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="vanity.c1.p9"><s sid="16" id="vanity.c1.s16">In the present instance Miss Pinkerton's "billet" was to the following effect:--</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="vanity.c1.p12"><s sid="20" id="vanity.c1.s20">In music, in dancing, in orthography, in every variety of embroidery and needlework, she will be found to have realized her friends' fondest wishes.</s> <s sid="21" id="vanity.c1.s21">In geography there is still much to be desired; and a careful and undeviating use of the backboard, for four hours daily during the next three years, is recommended as necessary to the acquirement of that dignified DEPORTMENT AND CARRIAGE, so requisite for every young lady of FASHION.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="vanity.c1.p13"><s sid="22" id="vanity.c1.s22">In the principles of religion and morality, Miss Sedley will be found worthy of an establishment which has been honoured by the presence of THE GREAT LEXICOGRAPHER, and the patronage of the admirable Mrs. Chapone.</s> <s sid="23" id="vanity.c1.s23">In leaving the Mall, Miss Amelia carries with her the hearts of her companions, and the affectionate regards of her mistress, who has the honour to subscribe herself,</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="vanity.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="vanity.c1.s28">This letter completed, Miss Pinkerton proceeded to write her own name, and Miss Sedley's, in the fly-leaf of a Johnson's Dictionary-- the interesting work which she invariably presented to her scholars, on their departure from the Mall.</s> <s sid="29" id="vanity.c1.s29">On the cover was inserted a copy of <qs/>"Lines addressed to a young lady on quitting Miss Pinkerton's school, at the Mall; by the late revered Doctor Samuel Johnson."<qe/></s> <s sid="30" id="vanity.c1.s30">In fact, the Lexicographer's name was always on the lips of this majestic woman, and a visit he had paid to her was the cause of her reputation and her fortune.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="vanity.c1.p17"><s sid="31" id="vanity.c1.s31">Being commanded by her elder sister to get "the Dictionary" from the cupboard, Miss Jemima had extracted two copies of the book from the receptacle in question.</s> <s sid="32" id="vanity.c1.s32">When Miss Pinkerton had finished the inscription in the first, Jemima, with rather a dubious and timid air, handed her the second.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="vanity.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="vanity.c1.s33"><qs/>"For whom is this, Miss Jemima?"<qe/> said Miss Pinkerton, with awful coldness.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="vanity.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="vanity.c1.s34"><qs/>"For Becky Sharp,"<qe/> answered Jemima, trembling very much, and blushing over her withered face and neck, as she turned her back on her sister.</s> <s sid="35" id="vanity.c1.s35"><qs/>"For Becky Sharp: she's going too."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="vanity.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="vanity.c1.s36"><qs/>"MISS JEMIMA!"<qe/> exclaimed Miss Pinkerton, in the largest capitals.</s> <s sid="37" id="vanity.c1.s37"><qs/>"Are you in your senses?</s> <s sid="38" id="vanity.c1.s38">Replace the Dixonary in the closet, and never venture to take such a liberty in future."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="vanity.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="vanity.c1.s39"><qs/>"Well, sister, it's only two-and-ninepence, and poor Becky will be miserable if she don't get one."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="vanity.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="vanity.c1.s40"><qs/>"Send Miss Sedley instantly to me,"<qe/> said Miss Pinkerton.</s> <s sid="41" id="vanity.c1.s41">And so venturing not to say another word, poor Jemima trotted off, exceedingly flurried and nervous.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="vanity.c1.p23"><s sid="42" id="vanity.c1.s42">Miss Sedley's papa was a merchant in London, and a man of some wealth; whereas Miss Sharp was an articled pupil, for whom Miss Pinkerton had done, as she thought, quite enough, without conferring upon her at parting the high honour of the Dixonary.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="vanity.c1.p24"><s sid="43" id="vanity.c1.s43">Although schoolmistresses' letters are to be trusted no more nor less than churchyard epitaphs; yet, as it sometimes happens that a person departs this life who is really deserving of all the praises the stone cutter carves over his bones; who IS a good Christian, a good parent, child, wife, or husband; who actually DOES leave a disconsolate family to mourn his loss; so in academies of the male and female sex it occurs every now and then that the pupil is fully worthy of the praises bestowed by the disinterested instructor.</s> <s sid="44" id="vanity.c1.s44">Now, Miss Amelia Sedley was a young lady of this singular species; and deserved not only all that Miss Pinkerton said in her praise, but had many charming qualities which that pompous old Minerva of a woman could not see, from the differences of rank and age between her pupil and herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="vanity.c1.p25"><s sid="45" id="vanity.c1.s45">For she could not only sing like a lark, or a Mrs. Billington, and dance like Hillisberg or Parisot; and embroider beautifully; and spell as well as a Dixonary itself; but she had such a kindly, smiling, tender, gentle, generous heart of her own, as won the love of everybody who came near her, from Minerva herself down to the poor girl in the scullery, and the one-eyed tart-woman's daughter, who was permitted to vend her wares once a week to the young ladies in the Mall.</s> <s sid="46" id="vanity.c1.s46">She had twelve intimate and bosom friends out of the twenty-four young ladies.</s> <s sid="47" id="vanity.c1.s47">Even envious Miss Briggs never spoke ill of her; high and mighty Miss Saltire (Lord Dexter's granddaughter) allowed that her figure was genteel; and as for Miss Swartz, the rich woolly-haired mulatto from St.</s> <s sid="48" id="vanity.c1.s48">Kitt's, on the day Amelia went away, she was in such a passion of tears that they were obliged to send for Dr. Floss, and half tipsify her with salvolatile.</s> <s sid="49" id="vanity.c1.s49">Miss Pinkerton's attachment was, as may be supposed from the high position and eminent virtues of that lady, calm and dignified; but Miss Jemima had already whimpered several times at the idea of Amelia's departure; and, but for fear of her sister, would have gone off in downright hysterics, like the heiress (who paid double) of St.</s> <s sid="50" id="vanity.c1.s50">Kitt's.</s> <s sid="51" id="vanity.c1.s51">Such luxury of grief, however, is only allowed to parlour-boarders.</s> <s sid="52" id="vanity.c1.s52">Honest Jemima had all the bills, and the washing, and the mending, and the puddings, and the plate and crockery, and the servants to superintend.</s> <s sid="53" id="vanity.c1.s53">But why speak about her?</s> <s sid="54" id="vanity.c1.s54">It is probable that we shall not hear of her again from this moment to the end of time, and that when the great filigree iron gates are once closed on her, she and her awful sister will never issue therefrom into this little world of history.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="vanity.c1.p26"><s sid="55" id="vanity.c1.s55">But as we are to see a great deal of Amelia, there is no harm in saying, at the outset of our acquaintance, that she was a dear little creature; and a great mercy it is, both in life and in novels, which (and the latter especially) abound in villains of the most sombre sort, that we are to have for a constant companion so guileless and good-natured a person.</s> <s sid="56" id="vanity.c1.s56">As she is not a heroine, there is no need to describe her person; indeed I am afraid that her nose was rather short than otherwise, and her cheeks a great deal too round and red for a heroine; but her face blushed with rosy health, and her lips with the freshest of smiles, and she had a pair of eyes which sparkled with the brightest and honestest good-humour, except indeed when they filled with tears, and that was a great deal too often; for the silly thing would cry over a dead canary-bird; or over a mouse, that the cat haply had seized upon; or over the end of a novel, were it ever so stupid; and as for saying an unkind word to her, were any persons hard-hearted enough to do so--why, so much the worse for them.</s> <s sid="57" id="vanity.c1.s57">Even Miss Pinkerton, that austere and godlike woman, ceased scolding her after the first time, and though she no more comprehended sensibility than she did Algebra, gave all masters and teachers particular orders to treat Miss Sedley with the utmost gentleness, as harsh treatment was injurious to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="vanity.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="vanity.c1.s58">So that when the day of departure came, between her two customs of laughing and crying, Miss Sedley was greatly puzzled how to act.</s> <s sid="59" id="vanity.c1.s59">She was glad to go home, and yet most woefully sad at leaving school.</s> <s sid="60" id="vanity.c1.s60">For three days before, little Laura Martin, the orphan, followed her about like a little dog.</s> <s sid="61" id="vanity.c1.s61">She had to make and receive at least fourteen presents--to make fourteen solemn promises of writing every week:</s> <s sid="62" id="vanity.c1.s62"><qs/>"Send my letters under cover to my grandpapa, the Earl of Dexter,"<qe/> said Miss Saltire (who, by the way, was rather shabby).</s> <s sid="63" id="vanity.c1.s63"><qs/>"Never mind the postage, but write every day, you dear darling,"<qe/><sls/> said the impetuous and woolly-headed, but generous and affectionate Miss Swartz; and the orphan little Laura Martin (who was just in round-hand), took her friend's hand and said, looking up in her face wistfully, <sle/><qs/>"Amelia, when I write to you I shall call you Mamma."<qe/></s> <s sid="64" id="vanity.c1.s64">All which details, I have no doubt, JONES, who reads this book at his Club, will pronounce to be excessively foolish, trivial, twaddling, and ultra-sentimental.</s> <s sid="65" id="vanity.c1.s65">Yes; I can see Jones at this minute (rather flushed with his joint of mutton and half pint of wine), taking out his pencil and scoring under the words <qs/>"foolish, twaddling,"<qe/><sls/> &amp;c., and adding to them his own remark of <sle/><qs/>"QUITE TRUE."<qe/></s> <s sid="66" id="vanity.c1.s66">Well, he is a lofty man of genius, and admires the great and heroic in life and novels; and so had better take warning and go elsewhere.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="vanity.c1.p28"><s sid="67" id="vanity.c1.s67">Well, then.</s> <s sid="68" id="vanity.c1.s68">The flowers, and the presents, and the trunks, and bonnet-boxes of Miss Sedley having been arranged by Mr. Sambo in the carriage, together with a very small and weather-beaten old cow's- skin trunk with Miss Sharp's card neatly nailed upon it, which was delivered by Sambo with a grin, and packed by the coachman with a corresponding sneer--the hour for parting came; and the grief of that moment was considerably lessened by the admirable discourse which Miss Pinkerton addressed to her pupil.</s> <s sid="69" id="vanity.c1.s69">Not that the parting speech caused Amelia to philosophise, or that it armed her in any way with a calmness, the result of argument; but it was intolerably dull, pompous, and tedious; and having the fear of her schoolmistress greatly before her eyes, Miss Sedley did not venture, in her presence, to give way to any ebullitions of private grief.</s> <s sid="70" id="vanity.c1.s70">A seed-cake and a bottle of wine were produced in the drawing-room, as on the solemn occasions of the visits of parents, and these refreshments being partaken of, Miss Sedley was at liberty to depart.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="vanity.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="vanity.c1.s73">Miss Pinkerton did not understand French; she only directed those who did: but biting her lips and throwing up her venerable and Roman-nosed head (on the top of which figured a large and solemn turban), she said, <qs/>"Miss Sharp, I wish you a good morning."<qe/></s> <s sid="74" id="vanity.c1.s74">As the Hammersmith Semiramis spoke, she waved one hand, both by way of adieu, and to give Miss Sharp an opportunity of shaking one of the fingers of the hand which was left out for that purpose.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="vanity.c1.p32" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="vanity.c1.s75">Miss Sharp only folded her own hands with a very frigid smile and bow, and quite declined to accept the proffered honour; on which Semiramis tossed up her turban more indignantly than ever.</s> <s sid="76" id="vanity.c1.s76">In fact, it was a little battle between the young lady and the old one, and the latter was worsted.</s> <s sid="77" id="vanity.c1.s77"><qs/>"Heaven bless you, my child,"<qe/> said she, embracing Amelia, and scowling the while over the girl's shoulder at Miss Sharp.</s> <s sid="78" id="vanity.c1.s78"><qs/>"Come away, Becky,"<qe/> said Miss Jemima, pulling the young woman away in great alarm, and the drawing-room door closed upon them for ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="vanity.c2.p16"><s sid="59" id="vanity.c2.s59">The fact is, the old lady believed Rebecca to be the meekest creature in the world, so admirably, on the occasions when her father brought her to Chiswick, used Rebecca to perform the part of the ingenue; and only a year before the arrangement by which Rebecca had been admitted into her house, and when Rebecca was sixteen years old, Miss Pinkerton majestically, and with a little speech, made her a present of a doll--which was, by the way, the confiscated property of Miss Swindle, discovered surreptitiously nursing it in school- hours.</s> <s sid="60" id="vanity.c2.s60">How the father and daughter laughed as they trudged home together after the evening party (it was on the occasion of the speeches, when all the professors were invited) and how Miss Pinkerton would have raged had she seen the caricature of herself which the little mimic, Rebecca, managed to make out of her doll.</s> <s sid="61" id="vanity.c2.s61">Becky used to go through dialogues with it; it formed the delight of Newman Street, Gerrard Street, and the Artists' quarter: and the young painters, when they came to take their gin-and-water with their lazy, dissolute, clever, jovial senior, used regularly to ask Rebecca if Miss Pinkerton was at home: she was as well known to them, poor soul! as Mr. Lawrence or President West.</s> <s sid="62" id="vanity.c2.s62">Once Rebecca had the honour to pass a few days at Chiswick; after which she brought back Jemima, and erected another doll as Miss Jemmy: for though that honest creature had made and given her jelly and cake enough for three children, and a seven-shilling piece at parting, the girl's sense of ridicule was far stronger than her gratitude, and she sacrificed Miss Jemmy quite as pitilessly as her sister.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="vanity.c5.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="vanity.c5.s1">Cuff's fight with Dobbin, and the unexpected issue of that contest, will long be remembered by every man who was educated at Dr. Swishtail's famous school.</s> <s sid="2" id="vanity.c5.s2">The latter Youth (who used to be called Heigh-ho Dobbin, Gee-ho Dobbin, and by many other names indicative of puerile contempt) was the quietest, the clumsiest, and, as it seemed, the dullest of all Dr. Swishtail's young gentlemen.</s> <s sid="3" id="vanity.c5.s3">His parent was a grocer in the city: and it was bruited abroad that he was admitted into Dr. Swishtail's academy upon what are called <qs/>"mutual principles"<qe/>--that is to say, the expenses of his board and schooling were defrayed by his father in goods, not money; and he stood there--most at the bottom of the school--in his scraggy corduroys and jacket, through the seams of which his great big bones were bursting--as the representative of so many pounds of tea, candles, sugar, mottled-soap, plums (of which a very mild proportion was supplied for the puddings of the establishment), and other commodities.</s> <s sid="4" id="vanity.c5.s4">A dreadful day it was for young Dobbin when one of the youngsters of the school, having run into the town upon a poaching excursion for hardbake and polonies, espied the cart of Dobbin &amp; Rudge, Grocers and Oilmen, Thames Street, London, at the Doctor's door, discharging a cargo of the wares in which the firm dealt.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vanity.c5.p3" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="vanity.c5.s10"><qs/>"Your father's only a merchant, Osborne,"<qe/> Dobbin said in private to the little boy who had brought down the storm upon him.</s> <s sid="11" id="vanity.c5.s11">At which the latter replied haughtily, "My father's a gentleman, and keeps his carriage"; and Mr. William Dobbin retreated to a remote outhouse in the playground, where he passed a half-holiday in the bitterest sadness and woe.</s> <s sid="12" id="vanity.c5.s12">Who amongst us is there that does not recollect similar hours of bitter, bitter childish grief?</s> <s sid="13" id="vanity.c5.s13">Who feels injustice; who shrinks before a slight; who has a sense of wrong so acute, and so glowing a gratitude for kindness, as a generous boy? and how many of those gentle souls do you degrade, estrange, torture, for the sake of a little loose arithmetic, and miserable dog-latin?</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="vanity.c5.p4"><s sid="14" id="vanity.c5.s14">Now, William Dobbin, from an incapacity to acquire the rudiments of the above language, as they are propounded in that wonderful book the Eton Latin Grammar, was compelled to remain among the very last of Doctor Swishtail's scholars, and was "taken down" continually by little fellows with pink faces and pinafores when he marched up with the lower form, a giant amongst them, with his downcast, stupefied look, his dog's-eared primer, and his tight corduroys.</s> <s sid="15" id="vanity.c5.s15">High and low, all made fun of him.</s> <s sid="16" id="vanity.c5.s16">They sewed up those corduroys, tight as they were.</s> <s sid="17" id="vanity.c5.s17">They cut his bed-strings.</s> <s sid="18" id="vanity.c5.s18">They upset buckets and benches, so that he might break his shins over them, which he never failed to do.</s> <s sid="19" id="vanity.c5.s19">They sent him parcels, which, when opened, were found to contain the paternal soap and candles.</s> <s sid="20" id="vanity.c5.s20">There was no little fellow but had his jeer and joke at Dobbin; and he bore everything quite patiently, and was entirely dumb and miserable.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="vanity.c5.p5"><s sid="21" id="vanity.c5.s21">Cuff, on the contrary, was the great chief and dandy of the Swishtail Seminary.</s> <s sid="22" id="vanity.c5.s22">He smuggled wine in.</s> <s sid="23" id="vanity.c5.s23">He fought the town-boys.</s> <s sid="24" id="vanity.c5.s24">Ponies used to come for him to ride home on Saturdays.</s> <s sid="25" id="vanity.c5.s25">He had his top-boots in his room, in which he used to hunt in the holidays.</s> <s sid="26" id="vanity.c5.s26">He had a gold repeater: and took snuff like the Doctor.</s> <s sid="27" id="vanity.c5.s27">He had been to the Opera, and knew the merits of the principal actors, preferring Mr. Kean to Mr. Kemble.</s> <s sid="28" id="vanity.c5.s28">He could knock you off forty Latin verses in an hour.</s> <s sid="29" id="vanity.c5.s29">He could make French poetry.</s> <s sid="30" id="vanity.c5.s30">What else didn't he know, or couldn't he do?</s> <s sid="31" id="vanity.c5.s31">They said even the Doctor himself was afraid of him.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="vanity.c5.p9" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="vanity.c5.s38"><qs/>"You CAN'T?"<qe/> says Mr. Cuff, laying hold of that document (in which many words were scratched out, many were mis-spelt, on which had been spent I don't know how much thought, and labour, and tears; for the poor fellow was writing to his mother, who was fond of him, although she was a grocer's wife, and lived in a back parlour in Thames Street).</s> <s sid="39" id="vanity.c5.s39"><qs/>"You CAN'T?"<qe/> says Mr. Cuff:</s> <s sid="40" id="vanity.c5.s40"><qs/>"I should like to know why, pray?</s> <s sid="41" id="vanity.c5.s41">Can't you write to old Mother Figs to-morrow?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="vanity.c5.p11" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="vanity.c5.s43"><qs/>"Well, sir, will you go?"<qe/> crowed the cock of the school.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="vanity.c5.p12" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="vanity.c5.s44"><qs/>"Put down the letter,"<qe/><sss/> Dobbin replied; <sse/><qs/>"no gentleman readth letterth."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="vanity.c5.p15"><s sid="49" id="vanity.c5.s49">Some time after this interview, it happened that Mr. Cuff, on a sunshiny afternoon, was in the neighbourhood of poor William Dobbin, who was lying under a tree in the playground, spelling over a favourite copy of the Arabian Nights which he had apart from the rest of the school, who were pursuing their various sports--quite lonely, and almost happy.</s> <s sid="50" id="vanity.c5.s50">If people would but leave children to themselves; if teachers would cease to bully them; if parents would not insist upon directing their thoughts, and dominating their feelings--those feelings and thoughts which are a mystery to all (for how much do you and I know of each other, of our children, of our fathers, of our neighbour, and how far more beautiful and sacred are the thoughts of the poor lad or girl whom you govern likely to be, than those of the dull and world-corrupted person who rules him?)--if, I say, parents and masters would leave their children alone a little more, small harm would accrue, although a less quantity of as in praesenti might be acquired.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="vanity.c5.p16"><s sid="51" id="vanity.c5.s51">Well, William Dobbin had for once forgotten the world, and was away with Sindbad the Sailor in the Valley of Diamonds, or with Prince Ahmed and the Fairy Peribanou in that delightful cavern where the Prince found her, and whither we should all like to make a tour; when shrill cries, as of a little fellow weeping, woke up his pleasant reverie; and looking up, he saw Cuff before him, belabouring a little boy.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="vanity.c5.p17" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="vanity.c5.s52">It was the lad who had peached upon him about the grocer's cart; but he bore little malice, not at least towards the young and small.</s> <s sid="53" id="vanity.c5.s53"><qs/>"How dare you, sir, break the bottle?"<qe/> says Cuff to the little urchin, swinging a yellow cricket-stump over him.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="vanity.c5.p18"><s sid="54" id="vanity.c5.s54">The boy had been instructed to get over the playground wall (at a selected spot where the broken glass had been removed from the top, and niches made convenient in the brick); to run a quarter of a mile; to purchase a pint of rum-shrub on credit; to brave all the Doctor's outlying spies, and to clamber back into the playground again; during the performance of which feat, his foot had slipt, and the bottle was broken, and the shrub had been spilt, and his pantaloons had been damaged, and he appeared before his employer a perfectly guilty and trembling, though harmless, wretch.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="vanity.c5.p19" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="vanity.c5.s55"><qs/>"How dare you, sir, break it?"<qe/><sss/> says Cuff; <sse/><qs/>"you blundering little thief.</s> <s sid="56" id="vanity.c5.s56">You drank the shrub, and now you pretend to have broken the bottle.</s> <s sid="57" id="vanity.c5.s57">Hold out your hand, sir."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="vanity.c5.p21" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="vanity.c5.s62"><qs/>"Hold out your other hand, sir,"<qe/> roars Cuff to his little schoolfellow, whose face was distorted with pain.</s> <s sid="63" id="vanity.c5.s63">Dobbin quivered, and gathered himself up in his narrow old clothes.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="vanity.c5.p22" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="vanity.c5.s64"><qs/>"Take that, you little devil!"<qe/> cried Mr. Cuff, and down came the wicket again on the child's hand.--Don't be horrified, ladies, every boy at a public school has done it.</s> <s sid="65" id="vanity.c5.s65">Your children will so do and be done by, in all probability.</s> <s sid="66" id="vanity.c5.s66">Down came the wicket again; and Dobbin started up.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="vanity.c5.p23" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="vanity.c5.s67">I can't tell what his motive was.</s> <s sid="68" id="vanity.c5.s68">Torture in a public school is as much licensed as the knout in Russia.</s> <s sid="69" id="vanity.c5.s69">It would be ungentlemanlike (in a manner) to resist it.</s> <s sid="70" id="vanity.c5.s70">Perhaps Dobbin's foolish soul revolted against that exercise of tyranny; or perhaps he had a hankering feeling of revenge in his mind, and longed to measure himself against that splendid bully and tyrant, who had all the glory, pride, pomp, circumstance, banners flying, drums beating, guards saluting, in the place.</s> <s sid="71" id="vanity.c5.s71">Whatever may have been his incentive, however, up he sprang, and screamed out, <qs/>"Hold off, Cuff; don't bully that child any more; or I'll--"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="vanity.c5.p28" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="vanity.c5.s80"><qs/>"Well, if you like,"<qe/> little Osborne replied; for you see his papa kept a carriage, and he was rather ashamed of his champion.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="vanity.c5.p29"><s sid="81" id="vanity.c5.s81">Yes, when the hour of battle came, he was almost ashamed to say, "Go it, Figs"; and not a single other boy in the place uttered that cry for the first two or three rounds of this famous combat; at the commencement of which the scientific Cuff, with a contemptuous smile on his face, and as light and as gay as if he was at a ball, planted his blows upon his adversary, and floored that unlucky champion three times running.</s> <s sid="82" id="vanity.c5.s82">At each fall there was a cheer; and everybody was anxious to have the honour of offering the conqueror a knee.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="vanity.c5.p30" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="vanity.c5.s83"><qs/>"What a licking I shall get when it's over,"<qe/> young Osborne thought, picking up his man.</s> <s sid="84" id="vanity.c5.s84"><qs/>"You'd best give in,"<qe/><sss/> he said to Dobbin; <sse/><qs/>"it's only a thrashing, Figs, and you know I'm used to it."<qe/></s> <s sid="85" id="vanity.c5.s85">But Figs, all whose limbs were in a quiver, and whose nostrils were breathing rage, put his little bottle-holder aside, and went in for a fourth time.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="vanity.c5.p31"><s sid="86" id="vanity.c5.s86">As he did not in the least know how to parry the blows that were aimed at himself, and Cuff had begun the attack on the three preceding occasions, without ever allowing his enemy to strike, Figs now determined that he would commence the engagement by a charge on his own part; and accordingly, being a left-handed man, brought that arm into action, and hit out a couple of times with all his might-- once at Mr. Cuff's left eye, and once on his beautiful Roman nose.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="vanity.c5.p32" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="vanity.c5.s87">Cuff went down this time, to the astonishment of the assembly.</s> <s sid="88" id="vanity.c5.s88"><qs/>"Well hit, by Jove,"<qe/> says little Osborne, with the air of a connoisseur, clapping his man on the back.</s> <s sid="89" id="vanity.c5.s89"><qs/>"Give it him with the left, Figs my boy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="vanity.c5.p34"><s sid="97" id="vanity.c5.s97">If I had the pen of a Napier, or a Bell's Life, I should like to describe this combat properly.</s> <s sid="98" id="vanity.c5.s98">It was the last charge of the Guard-- (that is, it would have been, only Waterloo had not yet taken place)--it was Ney's column breasting the hill of La Haye Sainte, bristling with ten thousand bayonets, and crowned with twenty eagles--it was the shout of the beef-eating British, as leaping down the hill they rushed to hug the enemy in the savage arms of battle-- in other words, Cuff coming up full of pluck, but quite reeling and groggy, the Fig-merchant put in his left as usual on his adversary's nose, and sent him down for the last time.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="vanity.c5.p54"><s sid="169" id="vanity.c5.s169">That evening, when Amelia came tripping into the drawing-room in a white muslin frock, prepared for conquest at Vauxhall, singing like a lark, and as fresh as a rose--a very tall ungainly gentleman, with large hands and feet, and large ears, set off by a closely cropped head of black hair, and in the hideous military frogged coat and cocked hat of those times, advanced to meet her, and made her one of the clumsiest bows that was ever performed by a mortal.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="vanity.c6.p1"><s sid="1" id="vanity.c6.s1">I know that the tune I am piping is a very mild one (although there are some terrific chapters coming presently), and must beg the good- natured reader to remember that we are only discoursing at present about a stockbroker's family in Russell Square, who are taking walks, or luncheon, or dinner, or talking and making love as people do in common life, and without a single passionate and wonderful incident to mark the progress of their loves.</s> <s sid="2" id="vanity.c6.s2">The argument stands thus--Osborne, in love with Amelia, has asked an old friend to dinner and to Vauxhall--Jos Sedley is in love with Rebecca.</s> <s sid="3" id="vanity.c6.s3">Will he marry her?</s> <s sid="4" id="vanity.c6.s4">That is the great subject now in hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vanity.c6.p2" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="vanity.c6.s5">We might have treated this subject in the genteel, or in the romantic, or in the facetious manner.</s> <s sid="6" id="vanity.c6.s6">Suppose we had laid the scene in Grosvenor Square, with the very same adventures--would not some people have listened?</s> <s sid="7" id="vanity.c6.s7">Suppose we had shown how Lord Joseph Sedley fell in love, and the Marquis of Osborne became attached to Lady Amelia, with the full consent of the Duke, her noble father: or instead of the supremely genteel, suppose we had resorted to the entirely low, and described what was going on in Mr. Sedley's kitchen--how black Sambo was in love with the cook (as indeed he was), and how he fought a battle with the coachman in her behalf; how the knife-boy was caught stealing a cold shoulder of mutton, and Miss Sedley's new femme de chambre refused to go to bed without a wax candle; such incidents might be made to provoke much delightful laughter, and be supposed to represent scenes of <qs/>"life."<qe/></s> <s sid="8" id="vanity.c6.s8">Or if, on the contrary, we had taken a fancy for the terrible, and made the lover of the new femme de chambre a professional burglar, who bursts into the house with his band, slaughters black Sambo at the feet of his master, and carries off Amelia in her night-dress, not to be let loose again till the third volume, we should easily have constructed a tale of thrilling interest, through the fiery chapters of which the reader should hurry, panting.</s> <s sid="9" id="vanity.c6.s9">But my readers must hope for no such romance, only a homely story, and must be content with a chapter about Vauxhall, which is so short that it scarce deserves to be called a chapter at all.</s> <s sid="10" id="vanity.c6.s10">And yet it is a chapter, and a very important one too.</s> <s sid="11" id="vanity.c6.s11">Are not there little chapters in everybody's life, that seem to be nothing, and yet affect all the rest of the history?</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vanity.c6.p3"><s sid="12" id="vanity.c6.s12">Let us then step into the coach with the Russell Square party, and be off to the Gardens.</s> <s sid="13" id="vanity.c6.s13">There is barely room between Jos and Miss Sharp, who are on the front seat.</s> <s sid="14" id="vanity.c6.s14">Mr. Osborne sitting bodkin opposite, between Captain Dobbin and Amelia.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="vanity.c6.p4" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="vanity.c6.s15">Every soul in the coach agreed that on that night Jos would propose to make Rebecca Sharp Mrs. Sedley.</s> <s sid="16" id="vanity.c6.s16">The parents at home had acquiesced in the arrangement, though, between ourselves, old Mr. Sedley had a feeling very much akin to contempt for his son.</s> <s sid="17" id="vanity.c6.s17">He said he was vain, selfish, lazy, and effeminate.</s> <s sid="18" id="vanity.c6.s18">He could not endure his airs as a man of fashion, and laughed heartily at his pompous braggadocio stories.</s> <s sid="19" id="vanity.c6.s19"><qs/>"I shall leave the fellow half my property,"<qe/><sss/> he said; <sse/><qs/>"and he will have, besides, plenty of his own; but as I am perfectly sure that if you, and I, and his sister were to die to-morrow, he would say <alt-qs/>'Good Gad!'<alt-qe/> and eat his dinner just as well as usual, I am not going to make myself anxious about him.</s> <s sid="20" id="vanity.c6.s20">Let him marry whom he likes.</s> <s sid="21" id="vanity.c6.s21">It's no affair of mine."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="vanity.c6.p5"><s sid="22" id="vanity.c6.s22">Amelia, on the other hand, as became a young woman of her prudence and temperament, was quite enthusiastic for the match.</s> <s sid="23" id="vanity.c6.s23">Once or twice Jos had been on the point of saying something very important to her, to which she was most willing to lend an ear, but the fat fellow could not be brought to unbosom himself of his great secret, and very much to his sister's disappointment he only rid himself of a large sigh and turned away.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="vanity.c6.p6"><s sid="24" id="vanity.c6.s24">This mystery served to keep Amelia's gentle bosom in a perpetual flutter of excitement.</s> <s sid="25" id="vanity.c6.s25">If she did not speak with Rebecca on the tender subject, she compensated herself with long and intimate conversations with Mrs. Blenkinsop, the housekeeper, who dropped some hints to the lady's-maid, who may have cursorily mentioned the matter to the cook, who carried the news, I have no doubt, to all the tradesmen, so that Mr. Jos's marriage was now talked of by a very considerable number of persons in the Russell Square world.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="vanity.c6.p7" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="vanity.c6.s26">It was, of course, Mrs. Sedley's opinion that her son would demean himself by a marriage with an artist's daughter.</s> <s sid="27" id="vanity.c6.s27"><qs/>"But, lor', Ma'am,"<qe/><sss/> ejaculated Mrs. Blenkinsop, <sse/><qs/>"we was only grocers when we married Mr. S., who was a stock-broker's clerk, and we hadn't five hundred pounds among us, and we're rich enough now."<qe/></s> <s sid="28" id="vanity.c6.s28">And Amelia was entirely of this opinion, to which, gradually, the good-natured Mrs. Sedley was brought.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="vanity.c6.p9"><s sid="34" id="vanity.c6.s34">So that everything seemed to smile upon Rebecca's fortunes.</s> <s sid="35" id="vanity.c6.s35">She took Jos's arm, as a matter of course, on going to dinner; she had sate by him on the box of his open carriage (a most tremendous "buck" he was, as he sat there, serene, in state, driving his greys), and though nobody said a word on the subject of the marriage, everybody seemed to understand it.</s> <s sid="36" id="vanity.c6.s36">All she wanted was the proposal, and ah! how Rebecca now felt the want of a mother!--a dear, tender mother, who would have managed the business in ten minutes, and, in the course of a little delicate confidential conversation, would have extracted the interesting avowal from the bashful lips of the young man!</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="vanity.c6.p10"><s sid="37" id="vanity.c6.s37">Such was the state of affairs as the carriage crossed Westminster bridge.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="vanity.c6.p11"><s sid="38" id="vanity.c6.s38">The party was landed at the Royal Gardens in due time.</s> <s sid="39" id="vanity.c6.s39">As the majestic Jos stepped out of the creaking vehicle the crowd gave a cheer for the fat gentleman, who blushed and looked very big and mighty, as he walked away with Rebecca under his arm.</s> <s sid="40" id="vanity.c6.s40">George, of course, took charge of Amelia.</s> <s sid="41" id="vanity.c6.s41">She looked as happy as a rose-tree in sunshine.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="vanity.c6.p13"><s sid="44" id="vanity.c6.s44">He walked very modestly behind them.</s> <s sid="45" id="vanity.c6.s45">He was not willing to spoil sport.</s> <s sid="46" id="vanity.c6.s46">About Rebecca and Jos he did not care a fig.</s> <s sid="47" id="vanity.c6.s47">But he thought Amelia worthy even of the brilliant George Osborne, and as he saw that good-looking couple threading the walks to the girl's delight and wonder, he watched her artless happiness with a sort of fatherly pleasure.</s> <s sid="48" id="vanity.c6.s48">Perhaps he felt that he would have liked to have something on his own arm besides a shawl (the people laughed at seeing the gawky young officer carrying this female burthen); but William Dobbin was very little addicted to selfish calculation at all; and so long as his friend was enjoying himself, how should he be discontented?</s> <s sid="49" id="vanity.c6.s49">And the truth is, that of all the delights of the Gardens; of the hundred thousand extra lamps, which were always lighted; the fiddlers in cocked hats, who played ravishing melodies under the gilded cockle-shell in the midst of the gardens; the singers, both of comic and sentimental ballads, who charmed the ears there; the country dances, formed by bouncing cockneys and cockneyesses, and executed amidst jumping, thumping and laughter; the signal which announced that Madame Saqui was about to mount skyward on a slack-rope ascending to the stars; the hermit that always sat in the illuminated hermitage; the dark walks, so favourable to the interviews of young lovers; the pots of stout handed about by the people in the shabby old liveries; and the twinkling boxes, in which the happy feasters made-believe to eat slices of almost invisible ham--of all these things, and of the gentle Simpson, that kind smiling idiot, who, I daresay, presided even then over the place--Captain William Dobbin did not take the slightest notice.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="vanity.c6.p14"><s sid="50" id="vanity.c6.s50">He carried about Amelia's white cashmere shawl, and having attended under the gilt cockle-shell, while Mrs. Salmon performed the Battle of Borodino (a savage cantata against the Corsican upstart, who had lately met with his Russian reverses)--Mr. Dobbin tried to hum it as he walked away, and found he was humming--the tune which Amelia Sedley sang on the stairs, as she came down to dinner.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="vanity.c6.p15"><s sid="51" id="vanity.c6.s51">He burst out laughing at himself; for the truth is, he could sing no better than an owl.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="vanity.c6.p16"><s sid="52" id="vanity.c6.s52">It is to be understood, as a matter of course, that our young people, being in parties of two and two, made the most solemn promises to keep together during the evening, and separated in ten minutes afterwards.</s> <s sid="53" id="vanity.c6.s53">Parties at Vauxhall always did separate, but 'twas only to meet again at supper-time, when they could talk of their mutual adventures in the interval.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vanity.c7.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="vanity.c7.s3">It is related, with regard to the borough of Queen's Crawley, that Queen Elizabeth in one of her progresses, stopping at Crawley to breakfast, was so delighted with some remarkably fine Hampshire beer which was then presented to her by the Crawley of the day (a handsome gentleman with a trim beard and a good leg), that she forthwith erected Crawley into a borough to send two members to Parliament; and the place, from the day of that illustrious visit, took the name of Queen's Crawley, which it holds up to the present moment.</s> <s sid="4" id="vanity.c7.s4">And though, by the lapse of time, and those mutations which age produces in empires, cities, and boroughs, Queen's Crawley was no longer so populous a place as it had been in Queen Bess's time-- nay, was come down to that condition of borough which used to be denominated rotten--yet, as Sir Pitt Crawley would say with perfect justice in his elegant way, <qs/>"Rotten! be hanged--it produces me a good fifteen hundred a year."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vanity.c9.p2"><s sid="4" id="vanity.c9.s4">Let us set down the items of her happiness.</s> <s sid="5" id="vanity.c9.s5">In the first place, she gave up Peter Butt, a young man who kept company with her, and in consequence of his disappointment in love, took to smuggling, poaching, and a thousand other bad courses.</s> <s sid="6" id="vanity.c9.s6">Then she quarrelled, as in duty bound, with all the friends and intimates of her youth, who, of course, could not be received by my Lady at Queen's Crawley--nor did she find in her new rank and abode any persons who were willing to welcome her.</s> <s sid="7" id="vanity.c9.s7">Who ever did?</s> <s sid="8" id="vanity.c9.s8">Sir Huddleston Fuddleston had three daughters who all hoped to be Lady Crawley.</s> <s sid="9" id="vanity.c9.s9">Sir Giles Wapshot's family were insulted that one of the Wapshot girls had not the preference in the marriage, and the remaining baronets of the county were indignant at their comrade's misalliance.</s> <s sid="10" id="vanity.c9.s10">Never mind the commoners, whom we will leave to grumble anonymously.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vanity.c9.p3"><s sid="11" id="vanity.c9.s11">Sir Pitt did not care, as he said, a brass farden for any one of them.</s> <s sid="12" id="vanity.c9.s12">He had his pretty Rose, and what more need a man require than to please himself?</s> <s sid="13" id="vanity.c9.s13">So he used to get drunk every night: to beat his pretty Rose sometimes: to leave her in Hampshire when he went to London for the parliamentary session, without a single friend in the wide world.</s> <s sid="14" id="vanity.c9.s14">Even Mrs. Bute Crawley, the Rector's wife, refused to visit her, as she said she would never give the pas to a tradesman's daughter.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER XIX Miss Crawley at Nurse</title>

<p pid="1" id="vanity.c19.p1"><s sid="1" id="vanity.c19.s1">We have seen how Mrs. Firkin, the lady's maid, as soon as any event of importance to the Crawley family came to her knowledge, felt bound to communicate it to Mrs. Bute Crawley, at the Rectory; and have before mentioned how particularly kind and attentive that good- natured lady was to Miss Crawley's confidential servant.</s> <s sid="2" id="vanity.c19.s2">She had been a gracious friend to Miss Briggs, the companion, also; and had secured the latter's good-will by a number of those attentions and promises, which cost so little in the making, and are yet so valuable and agreeable to the recipient.</s> <s sid="3" id="vanity.c19.s3">Indeed every good economist and manager of a household must know how cheap and yet how amiable these professions are, and what a flavour they give to the most homely dish in life.</s> <s sid="4" id="vanity.c19.s4">Who was the blundering idiot who said that "fine words butter no parsnips"?</s> <s sid="5" id="vanity.c19.s5">Half the parsnips of society are served and rendered palatable with no other sauce.</s> <s sid="6" id="vanity.c19.s6">As the immortal Alexis Soyer can make more delicious soup for a half-penny than an ignorant cook can concoct with pounds of vegetables and meat, so a skilful artist will make a few simple and pleasing phrases go farther than ever so much substantial benefit-stock in the hands of a mere bungler.</s> <s sid="7" id="vanity.c19.s7">Nay, we know that substantial benefits often sicken some stomachs; whereas, most will digest any amount of fine words, and be always eager for more of the same food.</s> <s sid="8" id="vanity.c19.s8">Mrs. Bute had told Briggs and Firkin so often of the depth of her affection for them; and what she would do, if she had Miss Crawley's fortune, for friends so excellent and attached, that the ladies in question had the deepest regard for her; and felt as much gratitude and confidence as if Mrs. Bute had loaded them with the most expensive favours.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vanity.c19.p2"><s sid="9" id="vanity.c19.s9">Rawdon Crawley, on the other hand, like a selfish heavy dragoon as he was, never took the least trouble to conciliate his aunt's aides- de-camp, showed his contempt for the pair with entire frankness-- made Firkin pull off his boots on one occasion--sent her out in the rain on ignominious messages--and if he gave her a guinea, flung it to her as if it were a box on the ear.</s> <s sid="10" id="vanity.c19.s10">As his aunt, too, made a butt of Briggs, the Captain followed the example, and levelled his jokes at her--jokes about as delicate as a kick from his charger.</s> <s sid="11" id="vanity.c19.s11">Whereas, Mrs. Bute consulted her in matters of taste or difficulty, admired her poetry, and by a thousand acts of kindness and politeness, showed her appreciation of Briggs; and if she made Firkin a twopenny-halfpenny present, accompanied it with so many compliments, that the twopence-half-penny was transmuted into gold in the heart of the grateful waiting-maid, who, besides, was looking forwards quite contentedly to some prodigious benefit which must happen to her on the day when Mrs. Bute came into her fortune.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vanity.c19.p3"><s sid="12" id="vanity.c19.s12">The different conduct of these two people is pointed out respectfully to the attention of persons commencing the world.</s> <s sid="13" id="vanity.c19.s13">Praise everybody, I say to such: never be squeamish, but speak out your compliment both point-blank in a man's face, and behind his back, when you know there is a reasonable chance of his hearing it again.</s> <s sid="14" id="vanity.c19.s14">Never lose a chance of saying a kind word.</s> <s sid="15" id="vanity.c19.s15">As Collingwood never saw a vacant place in his estate but he took an acorn out of his pocket and popped it in; so deal with your compliments through life.</s> <s sid="16" id="vanity.c19.s16">An acorn costs nothing; but it may sprout into a prodigious bit of timber.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="vanity.c19.p4"><s sid="17" id="vanity.c19.s17">In a word, during Rawdon Crawley's prosperity, he was only obeyed with sulky acquiescence; when his disgrace came, there was nobody to help or pity him.</s> <s sid="18" id="vanity.c19.s18">Whereas, when Mrs. Bute took the command at Miss Crawley's house, the garrison there were charmed to act under such a leader, expecting all sorts of promotion from her promises, her generosity, and her kind words.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="vanity.c19.p5"><s sid="19" id="vanity.c19.s19">That he would consider himself beaten, after one defeat, and make no attempt to regain the position he had lost, Mrs. Bute Crawley never allowed herself to suppose.</s> <s sid="20" id="vanity.c19.s20">She knew Rebecca to be too clever and spirited and desperate a woman to submit without a struggle; and felt that she must prepare for that combat, and be incessantly watchful against assault; or mine, or surprise.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="vanity.c19.p6" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="vanity.c19.s21">In the first place, though she held the town, was she sure of the principal inhabitant?</s> <s sid="22" id="vanity.c19.s22">Would Miss Crawley herself hold out; and had she not a secret longing to welcome back the ousted adversary?</s> <s sid="23" id="vanity.c19.s23">The old lady liked Rawdon, and Rebecca, who amused her.</s> <s sid="24" id="vanity.c19.s24">Mrs. Bute could not disguise from herself the fact that none of her party could so contribute to the pleasures of the town-bred lady.</s> <s sid="25" id="vanity.c19.s25"><qs/>"My girls' singing, after that little odious governess's, I know is unbearable,"<qe/> the candid Rector's wife owned to herself.</s> <s sid="26" id="vanity.c19.s26"><qs/>"She always used to go to sleep when Martha and Louisa played their duets.</s> <s sid="27" id="vanity.c19.s27">Jim's stiff college manners and poor dear Bute's talk about his dogs and horses always annoyed her.</s> <s sid="28" id="vanity.c19.s28">If I took her to the Rectory, she would grow angry with us all, and fly, I know she would; and might fall into that horrid Rawdon's clutches again, and be the victim of that little viper of a Sharp.</s> <s sid="29" id="vanity.c19.s29">Meanwhile, it is clear to me that she is exceedingly unwell, and cannot move for some weeks, at any rate; during which we must think of some plan to protect her from the arts of those unprincipled people."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="vanity.c19.p7"><s sid="30" id="vanity.c19.s30">In the very best-of moments, if anybody told Miss Crawley that she was, or looked ill, the trembling old lady sent off for her doctor; and I daresay she was very unwell after the sudden family event, which might serve to shake stronger nerves than hers.</s> <s sid="31" id="vanity.c19.s31">At least, Mrs. Bute thought it was her duty to inform the physician, and the apothecary, and the dame-de-compagnie, and the domestics, that Miss Crawley was in a most critical state, and that they were to act accordingly.</s> <s sid="32" id="vanity.c19.s32">She had the street laid knee-deep with straw; and the knocker put by with Mr. Bowls's plate.</s> <s sid="33" id="vanity.c19.s33">She insisted that the Doctor should call twice a day; and deluged her patient with draughts every two hours.</s> <s sid="34" id="vanity.c19.s34">When anybody entered the room, she uttered a shshshsh so sibilant and ominous, that it frightened the poor old lady in her bed, from which she could not look without seeing Mrs. Bute's beady eyes eagerly fixed on her, as the latter sate steadfast in the arm- chair by the bedside.</s> <s sid="35" id="vanity.c19.s35">They seemed to lighten in the dark (for she kept the curtains closed) as she moved about the room on velvet paws like a cat.</s> <s sid="36" id="vanity.c19.s36">There Miss Crawley lay for days--ever so many days--Mr. Bute reading books of devotion to her: for nights, long nights, during which she had to hear the watchman sing, the night-light sputter; visited at midnight, the last thing, by the stealthy apothecary; and then left to look at Mrs. Bute's twinkling eyes, or the flicks of yellow that the rushlight threw on the dreary darkened ceiling.</s> <s sid="37" id="vanity.c19.s37">Hygeia herself would have fallen sick under such a regimen; and how much more this poor old nervous victim?</s> <s sid="38" id="vanity.c19.s38">It has been said that when she was in health and good spirits, this venerable inhabitant of Vanity Fair had as free notions about religion and morals as Monsieur de Voltaire himself could desire, but when illness overtook her, it was aggravated by the most dreadful terrors of death, and an utter cowardice took possession of the prostrate old sinner.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="vanity.c19.p8"><s sid="39" id="vanity.c19.s39">Sick-bed homilies and pious reflections are, to be sure, out of place in mere story-books, and we are not going (after the fashion of some novelists of the present day) to cajole the public into a sermon, when it is only a comedy that the reader pays his money to witness.</s> <s sid="40" id="vanity.c19.s40">But, without preaching, the truth may surely be borne in mind, that the bustle, and triumph, and laughter, and gaiety which Vanity Fair exhibits in public, do not always pursue the performer into private life, and that the most dreary depression of spirits and dismal repentances sometimes overcome him.</s> <s sid="41" id="vanity.c19.s41">Recollection of the best ordained banquets will scarcely cheer sick epicures.</s> <s sid="42" id="vanity.c19.s42">Reminiscences of the most becoming dresses and brilliant ball triumphs will go very little way to console faded beauties.</s> <s sid="43" id="vanity.c19.s43">Perhaps statesmen, at a particular period of existence, are not much gratified at thinking over the most triumphant divisions; and the success or the pleasure of yesterday becomes of very small account when a certain (albeit uncertain) morrow is in view, about which all of us must some day or other be speculating.</s> <s sid="44" id="vanity.c19.s44">O brother wearers of motley!</s> <s sid="45" id="vanity.c19.s45">Are there not moments when one grows sick of grinning and tumbling, and the jingling of cap and bells?</s> <s sid="46" id="vanity.c19.s46">This, dear friends and companions, is my amiable object--to walk with you through the Fair, to examine the shops and the shows there; and that we should all come home after the flare, and the noise, and the gaiety, and be perfectly miserable in private.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="vanity.c19.p9" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="vanity.c19.s47"><qs/>"If that poor man of mine had a head on his shoulders,"<qe/><sls/> Mrs. Bute Crawley thought to herself, <sle/><qs/>"how useful he might be, under present circumstances, to this unhappy old lady!</s> <s sid="48" id="vanity.c19.s48">He might make her repent of her shocking free-thinking ways; he might urge her to do her duty, and cast off that odious reprobate who has disgraced himself and his family; and he might induce her to do justice to my dear girls and the two boys, who require and deserve, I am sure, every assistance which their relatives can give them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="vanity.c19.p10"><s sid="49" id="vanity.c19.s49">And, as the hatred of vice is always a progress towards virtue, Mrs. Bute Crawley endeavoured to instil her sister-in-law a proper abhorrence for all Rawdon Crawley's manifold sins: of which his uncle's wife brought forward such a catalogue as indeed would have served to condemn a whole regiment of young officers.</s> <s sid="50" id="vanity.c19.s50">If a man has committed wrong in life, I don't know any moralist more anxious to point his errors out to the world than his own relations; so Mrs. Bute showed a perfect family interest and knowledge of Rawdon's history.</s> <s sid="51" id="vanity.c19.s51">She had all the particulars of that ugly quarrel with Captain Marker, in which Rawdon, wrong from the beginning, ended in shooting the Captain.</s> <s sid="52" id="vanity.c19.s52">She knew how the unhappy Lord Dovedale, whose mamma had taken a house at Oxford, so that he might be educated there, and who had never touched a card in his life till he came to London, was perverted by Rawdon at the Cocoa-Tree, made helplessly tipsy by this abominable seducer and perverter of youth, and fleeced of four thousand pounds.</s> <s sid="53" id="vanity.c19.s53">She described with the most vivid minuteness the agonies of the country families whom he had ruined-- the sons whom he had plunged into dishonour and poverty--the daughters whom he had inveigled into perdition.</s> <s sid="54" id="vanity.c19.s54">She knew the poor tradesmen who were bankrupt by his extravagance--the mean shifts and rogueries with which he had ministered to it--the astounding falsehoods by which he had imposed upon the most generous of aunts, and the ingratitude and ridicule by which he had repaid her sacrifices.</s> <s sid="55" id="vanity.c19.s55">She imparted these stories gradually to Miss Crawley; gave her the whole benefit of them; felt it to be her bounden duty as a Christian woman and mother of a family to do so; had not the smallest remorse or compunction for the victim whom her tongue was immolating; nay, very likely thought her act was quite meritorious, and plumed herself upon her resolute manner of performing it.</s> <s sid="56" id="vanity.c19.s56">Yes, if a man's character is to be abused, say what you will, there's nobody like a relation to do the business.</s> <s sid="57" id="vanity.c19.s57">And one is bound to own, regarding this unfortunate wretch of a Rawdon Crawley, that the mere truth was enough to condemn him, and that all inventions of scandal were quite superfluous pains on his friends' parts.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="vanity.c19.p11"><s sid="58" id="vanity.c19.s58">Rebecca, too, being now a relative, came in for the fullest share of Mrs. Bute's kind inquiries.</s> <s sid="59" id="vanity.c19.s59">This indefatigable pursuer of truth (having given strict orders that the door was to be denied to all emissaries or letters from Rawdon), took Miss Crawley's carriage, and drove to her old friend Miss Pinkerton, at Minerva House, Chiswick Mall, to whom she announced the dreadful intelligence of Captain Rawdon's seduction by Miss Sharp, and from whom she got sundry strange particulars regarding the ex-governess's birth and early history.</s> <s sid="60" id="vanity.c19.s60">The friend of the Lexicographer had plenty of information to give.</s> <s sid="61" id="vanity.c19.s61">Miss Jemima was made to fetch the drawing- master's receipts and letters.</s> <s sid="62" id="vanity.c19.s62">This one was from a spunging-house: that entreated an advance: another was full of gratitude for Rebecca's reception by the ladies of Chiswick: and the last document from the unlucky artist's pen was that in which, from his dying bed, he recommended his orphan child to Miss Pinkerton's protection.</s> <s sid="63" id="vanity.c19.s63">There were juvenile letters and petitions from Rebecca, too, in the collection, imploring aid for her father or declaring her own gratitude.</s> <s sid="64" id="vanity.c19.s64">Perhaps in Vanity Fair there are no better satires than letters.</s> <s sid="65" id="vanity.c19.s65">Take a bundle of your dear friend's of ten years back-- your dear friend whom you hate now.</s> <s sid="66" id="vanity.c19.s66">Look at a file of your sister's! how you clung to each other till you quarrelled about the twenty-pound legacy!</s> <s sid="67" id="vanity.c19.s67">Get down the round-hand scrawls of your son who has half broken your heart with selfish undutifulness since; or a parcel of your own, breathing endless ardour and love eternal, which were sent back by your mistress when she married the Nabob-- your mistress for whom you now care no more than for Queen Elizabeth.</s> <s sid="68" id="vanity.c19.s68">Vows, love, promises, confidences, gratitude, how queerly they read after a while!</s> <s sid="69" id="vanity.c19.s69">There ought to be a law in Vanity Fair ordering the destruction of every written document (except receipted tradesmen's bills) after a certain brief and proper interval.</s> <s sid="70" id="vanity.c19.s70">Those quacks and misanthropes who advertise indelible Japan ink should be made to perish along with their wicked discoveries.</s> <s sid="71" id="vanity.c19.s71">The best ink for Vanity Fair use would be one that faded utterly in a couple of days, and left the paper clean and blank, so that you might write on it to somebody else.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="vanity.c19.p12"><s sid="72" id="vanity.c19.s72">From Miss Pinkerton's the indefatigable Mrs. Bute followed the track of Sharp and his daughter back to the lodgings in Greek Street, which the defunct painter had occupied; and where portraits of the landlady in white satin, and of the husband in brass buttons, done by Sharp in lieu of a quarter's rent, still decorated the parlour walls.</s> <s sid="73" id="vanity.c19.s73">Mrs. Stokes was a communicative person, and quickly told all she knew about Mr. Sharp; how dissolute and poor he was; how good- natured and amusing; how he was always hunted by bailiffs and duns; how, to the landlady's horror, though she never could abide the woman, he did not marry his wife till a short time before her death; and what a queer little wild vixen his daughter was; how she kept them all laughing with her fun and mimicry; how she used to fetch the gin from the public-house, and was known in all the studios in the quarter--in brief, Mrs. Bute got such a full account of her new niece's parentage, education, and behaviour as would scarcely have pleased Rebecca, had the latter known that such inquiries were being made concerning her.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="vanity.c19.p13"><s sid="74" id="vanity.c19.s74">Of all these industrious researches Miss Crawley had the full benefit.</s> <s sid="75" id="vanity.c19.s75">Mrs. Rawdon Crawley was the daughter of an opera-girl.</s> <s sid="76" id="vanity.c19.s76">She had danced herself.</s> <s sid="77" id="vanity.c19.s77">She had been a model to the painters.</s> <s sid="78" id="vanity.c19.s78">She was brought up as became her mother's daughter.</s> <s sid="79" id="vanity.c19.s79">She drank gin with her father, &amp;c.</s> <s sid="80" id="vanity.c19.s80">&amp;c.</s> <s sid="81" id="vanity.c19.s81">It was a lost woman who was married to a lost man; and the moral to be inferred from Mrs. Bute's tale was, that the knavery of the pair was irremediable, and that no properly conducted person should ever notice them again.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="vanity.c19.p14"><s sid="82" id="vanity.c19.s82">These were the materials which prudent Mrs. Bute gathered together in Park Lane, the provisions and ammunition as it were with which she fortified the house against the siege which she knew that Rawdon and his wife would lay to Miss Crawley.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="vanity.c19.p15"><s sid="83" id="vanity.c19.s83">But if a fault may be found with her arrangements, it is this, that she was too eager: she managed rather too well; undoubtedly she made Miss Crawley more ill than was necessary; and though the old invalid succumbed to her authority, it was so harassing and severe, that the victim would be inclined to escape at the very first chance which fell in her way.</s> <s sid="84" id="vanity.c19.s84">Managing women, the ornaments of their sex--women who order everything for everybody, and know so much better than any person concerned what is good for their neighbours, don't sometimes speculate upon the possibility of a domestic revolt, or upon other extreme consequences resulting from their overstrained authority.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="vanity.c19.p16"><s sid="85" id="vanity.c19.s85">Thus, for instance, Mrs. Bute, with the best intentions no doubt in the world, and wearing herself to death as she did by foregoing sleep, dinner, fresh air, for the sake of her invalid sister-in-law, carried her conviction of the old lady's illness so far that she almost managed her into her coffin.</s> <s sid="86" id="vanity.c19.s86">She pointed out her sacrifices and their results one day to the constant apothecary, Mr. Clump.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER XX In Which Captain Dobbin Acts as the Messenger of Hymen</title>

<p pid="1" id="vanity.c20.p1"><s sid="1" id="vanity.c20.s1">Without knowing how, Captain William Dobbin found himself the great promoter, arranger, and manager of the match between George Osborne and Amelia.</s> <s sid="2" id="vanity.c20.s2">But for him it never would have taken place:  he could not but confess as much to himself, and smiled rather bitterly as he thought that he of all men in the world should be the person upon whom the care of this marriage had fallen.</s> <s sid="3" id="vanity.c20.s3">But though indeed the conducting of this negotiation was about as painful a task as could be set to him, yet when he had a duty to perform, Captain Dobbin was accustomed to go through it without many words or much hesitation: and, having made up his mind completely, that if Miss Sedley was balked of her husband she would die of the disappointment, he was determined to use all his best endeavours to keep her alive.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vanity.c20.p2"><s sid="4" id="vanity.c20.s4">I forbear to enter into minute particulars of the interview between George and Amelia, when the former was brought back to the feet (or should we venture to say the arms?) of his young mistress by the intervention of his friend honest William.</s> <s sid="5" id="vanity.c20.s5">A much harder heart than George's would have melted at the sight of that sweet face so sadly ravaged by grief and despair, and at the simple tender accents in which she told her little broken-hearted story: but as she did not faint when her mother, trembling, brought Osborne to her; and as she only gave relief to her overcharged grief, by laying her head on her lover's shoulder and there weeping for a while the most tender, copious, and refreshing tears--old Mrs. Sedley, too greatly relieved, thought it was best to leave the young persons to themselves; and so quitted Emmy crying over George's hand, and kissing it humbly, as if he were her supreme chief and master, and as if she were quite a guilty and unworthy person needing every favour and grace from him.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vanity.c20.p3"><s sid="6" id="vanity.c20.s6">This prostration and sweet unrepining obedience exquisitely touched and flattered George Osborne.</s> <s sid="7" id="vanity.c20.s7">He saw a slave before him in that simple yielding faithful creature, and his soul within him thrilled secretly somehow at the knowledge of his power.</s> <s sid="8" id="vanity.c20.s8">He would be generous-minded, Sultan as he was, and raise up this kneeling Esther and make a queen of her:  besides, her sadness and beauty touched him as much as her submission, and so he cheered her, and raised her up and forgave her, so to speak.</s> <s sid="9" id="vanity.c20.s9">All her hopes and feelings, which were dying and withering, this her sun having been removed from her, bloomed again and at once, its light being restored.</s> <s sid="10" id="vanity.c20.s10">You would scarcely have recognised the beaming little face upon Amelia's pillow that night as the one that was laid there the night before, so wan, so lifeless, so careless of all round about.</s> <s sid="11" id="vanity.c20.s11">The honest Irish maid-servant, delighted with the change, asked leave to kiss the face that had grown all of a sudden so rosy.</s> <s sid="12" id="vanity.c20.s12">Amelia put her arms round the girl's neck and kissed her with all her heart, like a child.</s> <s sid="13" id="vanity.c20.s13">She was little more.</s> <s sid="14" id="vanity.c20.s14">She had that night a sweet refreshing sleep, like one--and what a spring of inexpressible happiness as she woke in the morning sunshine!</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="vanity.c20.p4" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="vanity.c20.s15"><qs/>"He will be here again to-day,"<qe/> Amelia thought.</s> <s sid="16" id="vanity.c20.s16"><qs/>"He is the greatest and best of men."<qe/></s> <s sid="17" id="vanity.c20.s17">And the fact is, that George thought he was one of the generousest creatures alive: and that he was making a tremendous sacrifice in marrying this young creature.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="vanity.c20.p5"><s sid="18" id="vanity.c20.s18">While she and Osborne were having their delightful tete-a-tete above stairs, old Mrs. Sedley and Captain Dobbin were conversing below upon the state of the affairs, and the chances and future arrangements of the young people.</s> <s sid="19" id="vanity.c20.s19">Mrs. Sedley having brought the two lovers together and left them embracing each other with all their might, like a true woman, was of opinion that no power on earth would induce Mr. Sedley to consent to the match between his daughter and the son of a man who had so shamefully, wickedly, and monstrously treated him.</s> <s sid="20" id="vanity.c20.s20">And she told a long story about happier days and their earlier splendours, when Osborne lived in a very humble way in the New Road, and his wife was too glad to receive some of Jos's little baby things, with which Mrs. Sedley accommodated her at the birth of one of Osborne's own children.</s> <s sid="21" id="vanity.c20.s21">The fiendish ingratitude of that man, she was sure, had broken Mr. S.'s heart: and as for a marriage, he would never, never, never, never consent.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="vanity.c20.p7" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="vanity.c20.s28">It was not, however, Mr. Sedley's wrath which Dobbin feared, so much as that of the other parent concerned, and he owned that he had a very considerable doubt and anxiety respecting the behaviour of the black-browed old tyrant of a Russia merchant in Russell Square.</s> <s sid="29" id="vanity.c20.s29">He has forbidden the match peremptorily, Dobbin thought.</s> <s sid="30" id="vanity.c20.s30">He knew what a savage determined man Osborne was, and how he stuck by his word.</s> <s sid="31" id="vanity.c20.s31"><qs/>"The only chance George has of reconcilement,"<qe/><sss/> argued his friend, <sse/><qs/>"is by distinguishing himself in the coming campaign.</s> <s sid="32" id="vanity.c20.s32">If he dies they both go together.</s> <s sid="33" id="vanity.c20.s33">If he fails in distinction--what then?</s> <s sid="34" id="vanity.c20.s34">He has some money from his mother, I have heard enough to purchase his majority--or he must sell out and go and dig in Canada, or rough it in a cottage in the country."<qe/></s> <s sid="35" id="vanity.c20.s35">With such a partner Dobbin thought he would not mind Siberia--and, strange to say, this absurd and utterly imprudent young fellow never for a moment considered that the want of means to keep a nice carriage and horses, and of an income which should enable its possessors to entertain their friends genteelly, ought to operate as bars to the union of George and Miss Sedley.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="vanity.c20.p8"><s sid="36" id="vanity.c20.s36">It was these weighty considerations which made him think too that the marriage should take place as quickly as possible.</s> <s sid="37" id="vanity.c20.s37">Was he anxious himself, I wonder, to have it over?--as people, when death has occurred, like to press forward the funeral, or when a parting is resolved upon, hasten it.</s> <s sid="38" id="vanity.c20.s38">It is certain that Mr. Dobbin, having taken the matter in hand, was most extraordinarily eager in the conduct of it.</s> <s sid="39" id="vanity.c20.s39">He urged on George the necessity of immediate action:  he showed the chances of reconciliation with his father, which a favourable mention of his name in the Gazette must bring about.</s> <s sid="40" id="vanity.c20.s40">If need were he would go himself and brave both the fathers in the business.</s> <s sid="41" id="vanity.c20.s41">At all events, he besought George to go through with it before the orders came, which everybody expected, for the departure of the regiment from England on foreign service.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="vanity.c20.p9"><s sid="42" id="vanity.c20.s42">Bent upon these hymeneal projects, and with the applause and consent of Mrs. Sedley, who did not care to break the matter personally to her husband, Mr. Dobbin went to seek John Sedley at his house of call in the City, the Tapioca Coffee-house, where, since his own offices were shut up, and fate had overtaken him, the poor broken- down old gentleman used to betake himself daily, and write letters and receive them, and tie them up into mysterious bundles, several of which he carried in the flaps of his coat.</s> <s sid="43" id="vanity.c20.s43">I don't know anything more dismal than that business and bustle and mystery of a ruined man:  those letters from the wealthy which he shows you:  those worn greasy documents promising support and offering condolence which he places wistfully before you, and on which he builds his hopes of restoration and future fortune.</s> <s sid="44" id="vanity.c20.s44">My beloved reader has no doubt in the course of his experience been waylaid by many such a luckless companion.</s> <s sid="45" id="vanity.c20.s45">He takes you into the corner; he has his bundle of papers out of his gaping coat pocket; and the tape off, and the string in his mouth, and the favourite letters selected and laid before you; and who does not know the sad eager half-crazy look which he fixes on you with his hopeless eyes?</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="vanity.c20.p10" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="vanity.c20.s46">Changed into a man of this sort, Dobbin found the once florid, jovial, and prosperous John Sedley.</s> <s sid="47" id="vanity.c20.s47">His coat, that used to be so glossy and trim, was white at the seams, and the buttons showed the copper.</s> <s sid="48" id="vanity.c20.s48">His face had fallen in, and was unshorn; his frill and neckcloth hung limp under his bagging waistcoat.</s> <s sid="49" id="vanity.c20.s49">When he used to treat the boys in old days at a coffee-house, he would shout and laugh louder than anybody there, and have all the waiters skipping round him; it was quite painful to see how humble and civil he was to John of the Tapioca, a blear-eyed old attendant in dingy stockings and cracked pumps, whose business it was to serve glasses of wafers, and bumpers of ink in pewter, and slices of paper to the frequenters of this dreary house of entertainment, where nothing else seemed to be consumed.</s> <s sid="50" id="vanity.c20.s50">As for William Dobbin, whom he had tipped repeatedly in his youth, and who had been the old gentleman's butt on a thousand occasions, old Sedley gave his hand to him in a very hesitating humble manner now, and called him <qs/>"Sir."<qe/></s> <s sid="51" id="vanity.c20.s51">A feeling of shame and remorse took possession of William Dobbin as the broken old man so received and addressed him, as if he himself had been somehow guilty of the misfortunes which had brought Sedley so low.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="vanity.c20.p11" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="vanity.c20.s52"><qs/>"I am very glad to see you, Captain Dobbin, sir,"<qe/> says he, after a skulking look or two at his visitor (whose lanky figure and military appearance caused some excitement likewise to twinkle in the blear eyes of the waiter in the cracked dancing pumps, and awakened the old lady in black, who dozed among the mouldy old coffee-cups in the bar).</s> <s sid="53" id="vanity.c20.s53"><qs/>"How is the worthy alderman, and my lady, your excellent mother, sir?"<qe/></s> <s sid="54" id="vanity.c20.s54">He looked round at the waiter as he said, <qs/>"My lady,"<qe/><sls/> as much as to say, <sle/><qs/>"Hark ye, John, I have friends still, and persons of rank and reputation, too."<qe/></s> <s sid="55" id="vanity.c20.s55"><qs/>"Are you come to do anything in my way, sir?</s> <s sid="56" id="vanity.c20.s56">My young friends Dale and Spiggot do all my business for me now, until my new offices are ready; for I'm only here temporarily, you know, Captain.</s> <s sid="57" id="vanity.c20.s57">What can we do for you. sir?</s> <s sid="58" id="vanity.c20.s58">Will you like to take anything?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="vanity.c25.p1"><s sid="1" id="vanity.c25.s1">Conducted to the ladies, at the Ship Inn, Dobbin assumed a jovial and rattling manner, which proved that this young officer was becoming a more consummate hypocrite every day of his life.</s> <s sid="2" id="vanity.c25.s2">He was trying to hide his own private feelings, first upon seeing Mrs. George Osborne in her new condition, and secondly to mask the apprehensions he entertained as to the effect which the dismal news brought down by him would certainly have upon her.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vanity.c25.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="vanity.c25.s3"><qs/>"It is my opinion, George,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"that the French Emperor will be upon us, horse and foot, before three weeks are over, and will give the Duke such a dance as shall make the Peninsula appear mere child's play.</s> <s sid="4" id="vanity.c25.s4">But you need not say that to Mrs. Osborne, you know.</s> <s sid="5" id="vanity.c25.s5">There mayn't be any fighting on our side after all, and our business in Belgium may turn out to be a mere military occupation.</s> <s sid="6" id="vanity.c25.s6">Many persons think so; and Brussels is full of fine people and ladies of fashion."<qe/></s> <s sid="7" id="vanity.c25.s7">So it was agreed to represent the duty of the British army in Belgium in this harmless light to Amelia.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vanity.c25.p3"><s sid="8" id="vanity.c25.s8">This plot being arranged, the hypocritical Dobbin saluted Mrs. George Osborne quite gaily, tried to pay her one or two compliments relative to her new position as a bride (which compliments, it must be confessed, were exceedingly clumsy and hung fire woefully), and then fell to talking about Brighton, and the sea-air, and the gaieties of the place, and the beauties of the road and the merits of the Lightning coach and horses--all in a manner quite incomprehensible to Amelia, and very amusing to Rebecca, who was watching the Captain, as indeed she watched every one near whom she came.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vanity.c26.p2"><s sid="3" id="vanity.c26.s3">George pooh-poohed the wine and bullied the waiters royally, and Jos gobbled the turtle with immense satisfaction.</s> <s sid="4" id="vanity.c26.s4">Dobbin helped him to it; for the lady of the house, before whom the tureen was placed, was so ignorant of the contents, that she was going to help Mr. Sedley without bestowing upon him either calipash or calipee.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vanity.c26.p3" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="vanity.c26.s5">The splendour of the entertainment, and the apartments in which it was given, alarmed Mr. Dobbin, who remonstrated after dinner, when Jos was asleep in the great chair.</s> <s sid="6" id="vanity.c26.s6">But in vain he cried out against the enormity of turtle and champagne that was fit for an archbishop.</s> <s sid="7" id="vanity.c26.s7"><qs/>"I've always been accustomed to travel like a gentleman,"<qe/><sss/> George said, <sse/><qs/>"and, damme, my wife shall travel like a lady.</s> <s sid="8" id="vanity.c26.s8">As long as there's a shot in the locker, she shall want for nothing,"<qe/> said the generous fellow, quite pleased with himself for his magnificence of spirit.</s> <s sid="9" id="vanity.c26.s9">Nor did Dobbin try and convince him that Amelia's happiness was not centred in turtle-soup.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="vanity.c26.p11"><s sid="49" id="vanity.c26.s49">While these delicacies were being transacted below, Amelia, leaving the drawing-room, walked upstairs and found herself, she scarce knew how, in the little room which she had occupied before her marriage, and in that very chair in which she had passed so many bitter hours.</s> <s sid="50" id="vanity.c26.s50">She sank back in its arms as if it were an old friend; and fell to thinking over the past week, and the life beyond it.</s> <s sid="51" id="vanity.c26.s51">Already to be looking sadly and vaguely back: always to be pining for something which, when obtained, brought doubt and sadness rather than pleasure; here was the lot of our poor little creature and harmless lost wanderer in the great struggling crowds of Vanity Fair.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="vanity.c26.p12"><s sid="52" id="vanity.c26.s52">Here she sate, and recalled to herself fondly that image of George to which she had knelt before marriage.</s> <s sid="53" id="vanity.c26.s53">Did she own to herself how different the real man was from that superb young hero whom she had worshipped?</s> <s sid="54" id="vanity.c26.s54">It requires many, many years--and a man must be very bad indeed--before a woman's pride and vanity will let her own to such a confession.</s> <s sid="55" id="vanity.c26.s55">Then Rebecca's twinkling green eyes and baleful smile lighted upon her, and filled her with dismay.</s> <s sid="56" id="vanity.c26.s56">And so she sate for awhile indulging in her usual mood of selfish brooding, in that very listless melancholy attitude in which the honest maid-servant had found her, on the day when she brought up the letter in which George renewed his offer of marriage.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="vanity.c26.p16"><s sid="71" id="vanity.c26.s71">For the next day, George had more important "business" to transact than that which took him to see Mr. Kean in Shylock.</s> <s sid="72" id="vanity.c26.s72">Immediately on his arrival in London he had written off to his father's solicitors, signifying his royal pleasure that an interview should take place between them on the morrow.</s> <s sid="73" id="vanity.c26.s73">His hotel bill, losses at billiards and cards to Captain Crawley had almost drained the young man's purse, which wanted replenishing before he set out on his travels, and he had no resource but to infringe upon the two thousand pounds which the attorneys were commissioned to pay over to him.</s> <s sid="74" id="vanity.c26.s74">He had a perfect belief in his own mind that his father would relent before very long.</s> <s sid="75" id="vanity.c26.s75">How could any parent be obdurate for a length of time against such a paragon as he was?</s> <s sid="76" id="vanity.c26.s76">If his mere past and personal merits did not succeed in mollifying his father, George determined that he would distinguish himself so prodigiously in the ensuing campaign that the old gentleman must give in to him.</s> <s sid="77" id="vanity.c26.s77">And if not?</s> <s sid="78" id="vanity.c26.s78">Bah! the world was before him.</s> <s sid="79" id="vanity.c26.s79">His luck might change at cards, and there was a deal of spending in two thousand pounds.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vanity.c28.p2"><s sid="3" id="vanity.c28.s3">That period of Jos's life which now ensued was so full of incident, that it served him for conversation for many years after, and even the tiger-hunt story was put aside for more stirring narratives which he had to tell about the great campaign of Waterloo.</s> <s sid="4" id="vanity.c28.s4">As soon as he had agreed to escort his sister abroad, it was remarked that he ceased shaving his upper lip.</s> <s sid="5" id="vanity.c28.s5">At Chatham he followed the parades and drills with great assiduity.</s> <s sid="6" id="vanity.c28.s6">He listened with the utmost attention to the conversation of his brother officers (as he called them in after days sometimes), and learned as many military names as he could.</s> <s sid="7" id="vanity.c28.s7">In these studies the excellent Mrs. O'Dowd was of great assistance to him; and on the day finally when they embarked on board the Lovely Rose, which was to carry them to their destination, he made his appearance in a braided frock-coat and duck trousers, with a foraging cap ornamented with a smart gold band.</s> <s sid="8" id="vanity.c28.s8">Having his carriage with him, and informing everybody on board confidentially that he was going to join the Duke of Wellington's army, folks mistook him for a great personage, a commissary-general, or a government courier at the very least.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vanity.c28.p3" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="vanity.c28.s9">He suffered hugely on the voyage, during which the ladies were likewise prostrate; but Amelia was brought to life again as the packet made Ostend, by the sight of the transports conveying her regiment, which entered the harbour almost at the same time with the Lovely Rose.</s> <s sid="10" id="vanity.c28.s10">Jos went in a collapsed state to an inn, while Captain Dobbin escorted the ladies, and then busied himself in freeing Jos's carriage and luggage from the ship and the custom-house, for Mr. Jos was at present without a servant, Osborne's man and his own pampered menial having conspired together at Chatham, and refused point-blank to cross the water.</s> <s sid="11" id="vanity.c28.s11">This revolt, which came very suddenly, and on the last day, so alarmed Mr. Sedley, junior, that he was on the point of giving up the expedition, but Captain Dobbin (who made himself immensely officious in the business, Jos said), rated him and laughed at him soundly:  the mustachios were grown in advance, and Jos finally was persuaded to embark.</s> <s sid="12" id="vanity.c28.s12">In place of the well-bred and well-fed London domestics, who could only speak English, Dobbin procured for Jos's party a swarthy little Belgian servant who could speak no language at all; but who, by his bustling behaviour, and by invariably addressing Mr. Sedley as <qs/>"My lord,"<qe/> speedily acquired that gentleman's favour.</s> <s sid="13" id="vanity.c28.s13">Times are altered at Ostend now; of the Britons who go thither, very few look like lords, or act like those members of our hereditary aristocracy.</s> <s sid="14" id="vanity.c28.s14">They seem for the most part shabby in attire, dingy of linen, lovers of billiards and brandy, and cigars and greasy ordinaries.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="vanity.c28.p6"><s sid="28" id="vanity.c28.s28">Everybody had such a perfect feeling of confidence in the leader (for the resolute faith which the Duke of Wellington had inspired in the whole English nation was as intense as that more frantic enthusiasm with which at one time the French regarded Napoleon), the country seemed in so perfect a state of orderly defence, and the help at hand in case of need so near and overwhelming, that alarm was unknown, and our travellers, among whom two were naturally of a very timid sort, were, like all the other multiplied English tourists, entirely at ease.</s> <s sid="29" id="vanity.c28.s29">The famous regiment, with so many of whose officers we have made acquaintance, was drafted in canal boats to Bruges and Ghent, thence to march to Brussels.</s> <s sid="30" id="vanity.c28.s30">Jos accompanied the ladies in the public boats; the which all old travellers in Flanders must remember for the luxury and accommodation they afforded.</s> <s sid="31" id="vanity.c28.s31">So prodigiously good was the eating and drinking on board these sluggish but most comfortable vessels, that there are legends extant of an English traveller, who, coming to Belgium for a week, and travelling in one of these boats, was so delighted with the fare there that he went backwards and forwards from Ghent to Bruges perpetually until the railroads were invented, when he drowned himself on the last trip of the passage-boat.</s> <s sid="32" id="vanity.c28.s32">Jos's death was not to be of this sort, but his comfort was exceeding, and Mrs. O'Dowd insisted that he only wanted her sister Glorvina to make his happiness complete.</s> <s sid="33" id="vanity.c28.s33">He sate on the roof of the cabin all day drinking Flemish beer, shouting for Isidor, his servant, and talking gallantly to the ladies.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="vanity.c28.p9"><s sid="51" id="vanity.c28.s51">Having frequently been in presence of the enemy, or, in other words, faced the ladies at Cheltenham and Bath, our friend, the Collector, had lost a great deal of his pristine timidity, and was now, especially when fortified with liquor, as talkative as might be.</s> <s sid="52" id="vanity.c28.s52">He was rather a favourite with the regiment, treating the young officers with sumptuosity, and amusing them by his military airs.</s> <s sid="53" id="vanity.c28.s53">And as there is one well-known regiment of the army which travels with a goat heading the column, whilst another is led by a deer, George said with respect to his brother-in-law, that his regiment marched with an elephant.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="vanity.c28.p10"><s sid="54" id="vanity.c28.s54">Since Amelia's introduction to the regiment, George began to be rather ashamed of some of the company to which he had been forced to present her; and determined, as he told Dobbin (with what satisfaction to the latter it need not be said), to exchange into some better regiment soon, and to get his wife away from those damned vulgar women.</s> <s sid="55" id="vanity.c28.s55">But this vulgarity of being ashamed of one's society is much more common among men than women (except very great ladies of fashion, who, to be sure, indulge in it); and Mrs. Amelia, a natural and unaffected person, had none of that artificial shamefacedness which her husband mistook for delicacy on his own part.</s> <s sid="56" id="vanity.c28.s56">Thus Mrs. O'Dowd had a cock's plume in her hat, and a very large "repayther" on her stomach, which she used to ring on all occasions, narrating how it had been presented to her by her fawther, as she stipt into the car'ge after her mar'ge; and these ornaments, with other outward peculiarities of the Major's wife, gave excruciating agonies to Captain Osborne, when his wife and the Major's came in contact; whereas Amelia was only amused by the honest lady's eccentricities, and not in the least ashamed of her company.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="vanity.c28.p11" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="vanity.c28.s57">As they made that well-known journey, which almost every Englishman of middle rank has travelled since, there might have been more instructive, but few more entertaining, companions than Mrs. Major O'Dowd.</s> <s sid="58" id="vanity.c28.s58"><qs/>"Talk about kenal boats; my dear!</s> <s sid="59" id="vanity.c28.s59">Ye should see the kenal boats between Dublin and Ballinasloe.</s> <s sid="60" id="vanity.c28.s60">It's there the rapid travelling is; and the beautiful cattle.</s> <s sid="61" id="vanity.c28.s61">Sure me fawther got a goold medal (and his Excellency himself eat a slice of it, and said never was finer mate in his loif) for a four-year-old heifer, the like of which ye never saw in this country any day."<qe/></s> <s sid="62" id="vanity.c28.s62">And Jos owned with a sigh, <qs/>"that for good streaky beef, really mingled with fat and lean, there was no country like England."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="vanity.c31.p7"><s sid="23" id="vanity.c31.s23">Isidor, the valet, had looked on very sulkily, while Osborne's servant was disposing of his master's baggage previous to the Captain's departure:  for in the first place he hated Mr. Osborne, whose conduct to him, and to all inferiors, was generally overbearing (nor does the continental domestic like to be treated with insolence as our own better-tempered servants do), and secondly, he was angry that so many valuables should be removed from under his hands, to fall into other people's possession when the English discomfiture should arrive.</s> <s sid="24" id="vanity.c31.s24">Of this defeat he and a vast number of other persons in Brussels and Belgium did not make the slightest doubt.</s> <s sid="25" id="vanity.c31.s25">The almost universal belief was, that the Emperor would divide the Prussian and English armies, annihilate one after the other, and march into Brussels before three days were over: when all the movables of his present masters, who would be killed, or fugitives, or prisoners, would lawfully become the property of Monsieur Isidor.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vanity.c32.p2" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="vanity.c32.s19">The women were away all this time.</s> <s sid="20" id="vanity.c32.s20">After hearing the firing for a moment, the stout Major's wife bethought her of her friend in the next chamber, and ran in to watch, and if possible to console, Amelia.</s> <s sid="21" id="vanity.c32.s21">The idea that she had that helpless and gentle creature to protect, gave additional strength to the natural courage of the honest Irishwoman.</s> <s sid="22" id="vanity.c32.s22">She passed five hours by her friend's side, sometimes in remonstrance, sometimes talking cheerfully, oftener in silence and terrified mental supplication.</s> <s sid="23" id="vanity.c32.s23"><qs/>"I never let go her hand once,"<qe/><sls/> said the stout lady afterwards, <sle/><qs/>"until after sunset, when the firing was over."<qe/></s> <s sid="24" id="vanity.c32.s24">Pauline, the bonne, was on her knees at church hard by, praying for son homme a elle.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vanity.c32.p3"><s sid="25" id="vanity.c32.s25">When the noise of the cannonading was over, Mrs. O'Dowd issued out of Amelia's room into the parlour adjoining, where Jos sate with two emptied flasks, and courage entirely gone.</s> <s sid="26" id="vanity.c32.s26">Once or twice he had ventured into his sister's bedroom, looking very much alarmed, and as if he would say something.</s> <s sid="27" id="vanity.c32.s27">But the Major's wife kept her place, and he went away without disburthening himself of his speech.</s> <s sid="28" id="vanity.c32.s28">He was ashamed to tell her that he wanted to fly.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="vanity.c32.p4"><s sid="29" id="vanity.c32.s29">But when she made her appearance in the dining-room, where he sate in the twilight in the cheerless company of his empty champagne bottles, he began to open his mind to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="vanity.c32.p5" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="vanity.c32.s30"><qs/>"Mrs. O'Dowd,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"hadn't you better get Amelia ready?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="vanity.c32.p10" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="vanity.c32.s39"><qs/>"And what?"<qe/> asked Mrs. O'Dowd.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="vanity.c32.p11" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="vanity.c32.s40"><qs/>"I'm off for Ghent,"<qe/> Jos answered.</s> <s sid="41" id="vanity.c32.s41"><qs/>"Everybody is going; there's a place for you!</s> <s sid="42" id="vanity.c32.s42">We shall start in half-an-hour."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="vanity.c32.p12" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="vanity.c32.s43">The Major's wife looked at him with infinite scorn.</s> <s sid="44" id="vanity.c32.s44"><qs/>"I don't move till O'Dowd gives me the route,"<qe/> said she.</s> <s sid="45" id="vanity.c32.s45"><qs/>"You may go if you like, Mr. Sedley; but, faith, Amelia and I stop here."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="vanity.c32.p13" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="vanity.c32.s46"><qs/>"She SHALL go,"<qe/> said Jos, with another stamp of his foot.</s> <s sid="47" id="vanity.c32.s47">Mrs. O'Dowd put herself with arms akimbo before the bedroom door.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="vanity.c32.p14" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="vanity.c32.s48"><qs/>"Is it her mother you're going to take her to?"<qe/><sss/> she said; <sse/><qs/>"or do you want to go to Mamma yourself, Mr. Sedley?</s> <s sid="49" id="vanity.c32.s49">Good marning--a pleasant journey to ye, sir.</s> <s sid="50" id="vanity.c32.s50">Bon voyage, as they say, and take my counsel, and shave off them mustachios, or they'll bring you into mischief."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="vanity.c32.p15" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="vanity.c32.s51"><qs/>"D--n!"<qe/> yelled out Jos, wild with fear, rage, and mortification; and Isidor came in at this juncture, swearing in his turn.</s> <s sid="52" id="vanity.c32.s52"><qs/>"Pas de chevaux, sacre bleu!"<qe/> hissed out the furious domestic.</s> <s sid="53" id="vanity.c32.s53">All the horses were gone.</s> <s sid="54" id="vanity.c32.s54">Jos was not the only man in Brussels seized with panic that day.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="vanity.c32.p16"><s sid="55" id="vanity.c32.s55">But Jos's fears, great and cruel as they were already, were destined to increase to an almost frantic pitch before the night was over.</s> <s sid="56" id="vanity.c32.s56">It has been mentioned how Pauline, the bonne, had son homme a elle also in the ranks of the army that had gone out to meet the Emperor Napoleon.</s> <s sid="57" id="vanity.c32.s57">This lover was a native of Brussels, and a Belgian hussar.</s> <s sid="58" id="vanity.c32.s58">The troops of his nation signalised themselves in this war for anything but courage, and young Van Cutsum, Pauline's admirer, was too good a soldier to disobey his Colonel's orders to run away.</s> <s sid="59" id="vanity.c32.s59">Whilst in garrison at Brussels young Regulus (he had been born in the revolutionary times) found his great comfort, and passed almost all his leisure moments, in Pauline's kitchen; and it was with pockets and holsters crammed full of good things from her larder, that he had take leave of his weeping sweetheart, to proceed upon the campaign a few days before.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="vanity.c32.p17"><s sid="60" id="vanity.c32.s60">As far as his regiment was concerned, this campaign was over now.</s> <s sid="61" id="vanity.c32.s61">They had formed a part of the division under the command of his Sovereign apparent, the Prince of Orange, and as respected length of swords and mustachios, and the richness of uniform and equipments, Regulus and his comrades looked to be as gallant a body of men as ever trumpet sounded for.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="vanity.c32.p18"><s sid="62" id="vanity.c32.s62">When Ney dashed upon the advance of the allied troops, carrying one position after the other, until the arrival of the great body of the British army from Brussels changed the aspect of the combat of Quatre Bras, the squadrons among which Regulus rode showed the greatest activity in retreating before the French, and were dislodged from one post and another which they occupied with perfect alacrity on their part.</s> <s sid="63" id="vanity.c32.s63">Their movements were only checked by the advance of the British in their rear.</s> <s sid="64" id="vanity.c32.s64">Thus forced to halt, the enemy's cavalry (whose bloodthirsty obstinacy cannot be too severely reprehended) had at length an opportunity of coming to close quarters with the brave Belgians before them; who preferred to encounter the British rather than the French, and at once turning tail rode through the English regiments that were behind them, and scattered in all directions.</s> <s sid="65" id="vanity.c32.s65">The regiment in fact did not exist any more.</s> <s sid="66" id="vanity.c32.s66">It was nowhere.</s> <s sid="67" id="vanity.c32.s67">It had no head-quarters.</s> <s sid="68" id="vanity.c32.s68">Regulus found himself galloping many miles from the field of action, entirely alone; and whither should he fly for refuge so naturally as to that kitchen and those faithful arms in which Pauline had so often welcomed him?</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="vanity.c32.p19"><s sid="69" id="vanity.c32.s69">At some ten o'clock the clinking of a sabre might have been heard up the stair of the house where the Osbornes occupied a story in the continental fashion.</s> <s sid="70" id="vanity.c32.s70">A knock might have been heard at the kitchen door; and poor Pauline, come back from church, fainted almost with terror as she opened it and saw before her her haggard hussar.</s> <s sid="71" id="vanity.c32.s71">He looked as pale as the midnight dragoon who came to disturb Leonora.</s> <s sid="72" id="vanity.c32.s72">Pauline would have screamed, but that her cry would have called her masters, and discovered her friend.</s> <s sid="73" id="vanity.c32.s73">She stifled her scream, then, and leading her hero into the kitchen, gave him beer, and the choice bits from the dinner, which Jos had not had the heart to taste.</s> <s sid="74" id="vanity.c32.s74">The hussar showed he was no ghost by the prodigious quantity of flesh and beer which he devoured--and during the mouthfuls he told his tale of disaster.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="vanity.c32.p20"><s sid="75" id="vanity.c32.s75">His regiment had performed prodigies of courage, and had withstood for a while the onset of the whole French army.</s> <s sid="76" id="vanity.c32.s76">But they were overwhelmed at last, as was the whole British army by this time.</s> <s sid="77" id="vanity.c32.s77">Ney destroyed each regiment as it came up.</s> <s sid="78" id="vanity.c32.s78">The Belgians in vain interposed to prevent the butchery of the English.</s> <s sid="79" id="vanity.c32.s79">The Brunswickers were routed and had fled--their Duke was killed.</s> <s sid="80" id="vanity.c32.s80">It was a general debacle.</s> <s sid="81" id="vanity.c32.s81">He sought to drown his sorrow for the defeat in floods of beer.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="vanity.c32.p21" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="vanity.c32.s82">Isidor, who had come into the kitchen, heard the conversation and rushed out to inform his master.</s> <s sid="83" id="vanity.c32.s83"><qs/>"It is all over,"<qe/> he shrieked to Jos.</s> <s sid="84" id="vanity.c32.s84"><qs/>"Milor Duke is a prisoner; the Duke of Brunswick is killed; the British army is in full flight; there is only one man escaped, and he is in the kitchen now--come and hear him."<qe/></s> <s sid="85" id="vanity.c32.s85">So Jos tottered into that apartment where Regulus still sate on the kitchen table, and clung fast to his flagon of beer.</s> <s sid="86" id="vanity.c32.s86">In the best French which he could muster, and which was in sooth of a very ungrammatical sort, Jos besought the hussar to tell his tale.</s> <s sid="87" id="vanity.c32.s87">The disasters deepened as Regulus spoke.</s> <s sid="88" id="vanity.c32.s88">He was the only man of his regiment not slain on the field.</s> <s sid="89" id="vanity.c32.s89">He had seen the Duke of Brunswick fall, the black hussars fly, the Ecossais pounded down by the cannon.</s> <s sid="90" id="vanity.c32.s90"><qs/>"And the --th?"<qe/> gasped Jos.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="vanity.c32.p22" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="vanity.c32.s91"><qs/>"Cut in pieces,"<qe/><sls/> said the hussar--upon which Pauline cried out, <sle/><qs/>"O my mistress, ma bonne petite dame,"<qe/> went off fairly into hysterics, and filled the house with her screams.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="vanity.c32.p23"><s sid="92" id="vanity.c32.s92">Wild with terror, Mr. Sedley knew not how or where to seek for safety.</s> <s sid="93" id="vanity.c32.s93">He rushed from the kitchen back to the sitting-room, and cast an appealing look at Amelia's door, which Mrs. O'Dowd had closed and locked in his face; but he remembered how scornfully the latter had received him, and after pausing and listening for a brief space at the door, he left it, and resolved to go into the street, for the first time that day.</s> <s sid="94" id="vanity.c32.s94">So, seizing a candle, he looked about for his gold-laced cap, and found it lying in its usual place, on a console-table, in the anteroom, placed before a mirror at which Jos used to coquet, always giving his side-locks a twirl, and his cap the proper cock over his eye, before he went forth to make appearance in public.</s> <s sid="95" id="vanity.c32.s95">Such is the force of habit, that even in the midst of his terror he began mechanically to twiddle with his hair, and arrange the cock of his hat.</s> <s sid="96" id="vanity.c32.s96">Then he looked amazed at the pale face in the glass before him, and especially at his mustachios, which had attained a rich growth in the course of near seven weeks, since they had come into the world.</s> <s sid="97" id="vanity.c32.s97">They WILL mistake me for a military man, thought he, remembering Isidor's warning as to the massacre with which all the defeated British army was threatened; and staggering back to his bedchamber, he began wildly pulling the bell which summoned his valet.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="vanity.c32.p24"><s sid="98" id="vanity.c32.s98">Isidor answered that summons.</s> <s sid="99" id="vanity.c32.s99">Jos had sunk in a chair--he had torn off his neckcloths, and turned down his collars, and was sitting with both his hands lifted to his throat.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="vanity.c32.p25" type="speech"><s sid="100" id="vanity.c32.s100"><qs/>"Coupez-moi, Isidor,"<qe/><sss/> shouted he; <sse/><qs/>"vite!</s> <s sid="101" id="vanity.c32.s101">Coupez-moi!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="vanity.c32.p26"><s sid="102" id="vanity.c32.s102">Isidor thought for a moment he had gone mad, and that he wished his valet to cut his throat.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="vanity.c32.p27" type="speech"><s sid="103" id="vanity.c32.s103"><qs/>"Les moustaches,"<qe/><sss/> gasped Joe; <sse/><qs/>"les moustaches--coupy, rasy, vite!"<qe/>-- his French was of this sort--voluble, as we have said, but not remarkable for grammar.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="vanity.c32.p28" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="vanity.c32.s104">Isidor swept off the mustachios in no time with the razor, and heard with inexpressible delight his master's orders that he should fetch a hat and a plain coat.</s> <s sid="105" id="vanity.c32.s105"><qs/>"Ne porty ploo--habit militair--bonn--bonny a voo, prenny dehors"<qe/>--were Jos's words--the coat and cap were at last his property.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="vanity.c32.p29"><s sid="106" id="vanity.c32.s106">This gift being made, Jos selected a plain black coat and waistcoat from his stock, and put on a large white neckcloth, and a plain beaver.</s> <s sid="107" id="vanity.c32.s107">If he could have got a shovel hat he would have worn it.</s> <s sid="108" id="vanity.c32.s108">As it was, you would have fancied he was a flourishing, large parson of the Church of England.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="vanity.c32.p30" type="speech"><s sid="109" id="vanity.c32.s109"><qs/>"Venny maintenong,"<qe/><sss/> he continued, <sse/><qs/>"sweevy--ally--party--dong la roo."<qe/></s> <s sid="110" id="vanity.c32.s110">And so having said, he plunged swiftly down the stairs of the house, and passed into the street.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="vanity.c32.p31"><s sid="111" id="vanity.c32.s111">Although Regulus had vowed that he was the only man of his regiment or of the allied army, almost, who had escaped being cut to pieces by Ney, it appeared that his statement was incorrect, and that a good number more of the supposed victims had survived the massacre.</s> <s sid="112" id="vanity.c32.s112">Many scores of Regulus's comrades had found their way back to Brussels, and all agreeing that they had run away--filled the whole town with an idea of the defeat of the allies.</s> <s sid="113" id="vanity.c32.s113">The arrival of the French was expected hourly; the panic continued, and preparations for flight went on everywhere.</s> <s sid="114" id="vanity.c32.s114">No horses!  thought Jos, in terror.</s> <s sid="115" id="vanity.c32.s115">He made Isidor inquire of scores of persons, whether they had any to lend or sell, and his heart sank within him, at the negative answers returned everywhere.</s> <s sid="116" id="vanity.c32.s116">Should he take the journey on foot?</s> <s sid="117" id="vanity.c32.s117">Even fear could not render that ponderous body so active.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="vanity.c32.p32"><s sid="118" id="vanity.c32.s118">Almost all the hotels occupied by the English in Brussels face the Parc, and Jos wandered irresolutely about in this quarter, with crowds of other people, oppressed as he was by fear and curiosity.</s> <s sid="119" id="vanity.c32.s119">Some families he saw more happy than himself, having discovered a team of horses, and rattling through the streets in retreat; others again there were whose case was like his own, and who could not for any bribes or entreaties procure the necessary means of flight.</s> <s sid="120" id="vanity.c32.s120">Amongst these would-be fugitives, Jos remarked the Lady Bareacres and her daughter, who sate in their carriage in the porte-cochere of their hotel, all their imperials packed, and the only drawback to whose flight was the same want of motive power which kept Jos stationary.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="vanity.c32.p33"><s sid="121" id="vanity.c32.s121">Rebecca Crawley occupied apartments in this hotel; and had before this period had sundry hostile meetings with the ladies of the Bareacres family.</s> <s sid="122" id="vanity.c32.s122">My Lady Bareacres cut Mrs. Crawley on the stairs when they met by chance; and in all places where the latter's name was mentioned, spoke perseveringly ill of her neighbour.</s> <s sid="123" id="vanity.c32.s123">The Countess was shocked at the familiarity of General Tufto with the aide-de-camp's wife.</s> <s sid="124" id="vanity.c32.s124">The Lady Blanche avoided her as if she had been an infectious disease.</s> <s sid="125" id="vanity.c32.s125">Only the Earl himself kept up a sly occasional acquaintance with her, when out of the jurisdiction of his ladies.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="vanity.c32.p34"><s sid="126" id="vanity.c32.s126">Rebecca had her revenge now upon these insolent enemies.</s> <s sid="127" id="vanity.c32.s127">If became known in the hotel that Captain Crawley's horses had been left behind, and when the panic began, Lady Bareacres condescended to send her maid to the Captain's wife with her Ladyship's compliments, and a desire to know the price of Mrs. Crawley's horses.</s> <s sid="128" id="vanity.c32.s128">Mrs. Crawley returned a note with her compliments, and an intimation that it was not her custom to transact bargains with ladies' maids.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="vanity.c32.p35" type="speech"><s sid="129" id="vanity.c32.s129">This curt reply brought the Earl in person to Becky's apartment; but he could get no more success than the first ambassador.</s> <s sid="130" id="vanity.c32.s130"><qs/>"Send a lady's maid to ME!"<qe/></s> <s sid="131" id="vanity.c32.s131">Mrs. Crawley cried in great anger; <qs/>"why didn't my Lady Bareacres tell me to go and saddle the horses!</s> <s sid="132" id="vanity.c32.s132">Is it her Ladyship that wants to escape, or her Ladyship's femme de chambre?"<qe/></s> <s sid="133" id="vanity.c32.s133">And this was all the answer that the Earl bore back to his Countess.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="vanity.c33.p5"><s sid="15" id="vanity.c33.s15">The spinster had, however, rallied considerably; as was proved by the increased vigour and frequency of her sarcasms upon Miss Briggs, all which attacks the poor companion bore with meekness, with cowardice, with a resignation that was half generous and half hypocritical--with the slavish submission, in a word, that women of her disposition and station are compelled to show.</s> <s sid="16" id="vanity.c33.s16">Who has not seen how women bully women?</s> <s sid="17" id="vanity.c33.s17">What tortures have men to endure, comparable to those daily repeated shafts of scorn and cruelty with which poor women are riddled by the tyrants of their sex?</s> <s sid="18" id="vanity.c33.s18">Poor victims!</s> <s sid="19" id="vanity.c33.s19">But we are starting from our proposition, which is, that Miss Crawley was always particularly annoying and savage when she was rallying from illness--as they say wounds tingle most when they are about to heal.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="vanity.c33.p6"><s sid="20" id="vanity.c33.s20">While thus approaching, as all hoped, to convalescence, Miss Briggs was the only victim admitted into the presence of the invalid; yet Miss Crawley's relatives afar off did not forget their beloved kinswoman, and by a number of tokens, presents, and kind affectionate messages, strove to keep themselves alive in her recollection.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="vanity.c33.p9"><s sid="29" id="vanity.c33.s29">I wonder whether she knew that it was not only Becky who wrote the letters, but that Mrs. Rawdon actually took and sent home the trophies which she bought for a few francs, from one of the innumerable pedlars who immediately began to deal in relics of the war.</s> <s sid="30" id="vanity.c33.s30">The novelist, who knows everything, knows this also.</s> <s sid="31" id="vanity.c33.s31">Be this, however, as it may, Miss Crawley's gracious reply greatly encouraged our young friends, Rawdon and his lady, who hoped for the best from their aunt's evidently pacified humour:  and they took care to entertain her with many delightful letters from Paris, whither, as Rawdon said, they had the good luck to go in the track of the conquering army.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="vanity.c33.p10"><s sid="32" id="vanity.c33.s32">To the rector's lady, who went off to tend her husband's broken collar-bone at the Rectory at Queen's Crawley, the spinster's communications were by no means so gracious.</s> <s sid="33" id="vanity.c33.s33">Mrs. Bute, that brisk, managing, lively, imperious woman, had committed the most fatal of all errors with regard to her sister-in-law.</s> <s sid="34" id="vanity.c33.s34">She had not merely oppressed her and her household--she had bored Miss Crawley; and if poor Miss Briggs had been a woman of any spirit, she might have been made happy by the commission which her principal gave her to write a letter to Mrs. Bute Crawley, saying that Miss Crawley's health was greatly improved since Mrs. Bute had left her, and begging the latter on no account to put herself to trouble, or quit her family for Miss Crawley's sake.</s> <s sid="35" id="vanity.c33.s35">This triumph over a lady who had been very haughty and cruel in her behaviour to Miss Briggs, would have rejoiced most women; but the truth is, Briggs was a woman of no spirit at all, and the moment her enemy was discomfited, she began to feel compassion in her favour.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER XL In Which Becky Is Recognized by the Family</title>

<p pid="1" id="vanity.c40.p1"><s sid="1" id="vanity.c40.s1">The heir of Crawley arrived at home, in due time, after this catastrophe, and henceforth may be said to have reigned in Queen's Crawley.</s> <s sid="2" id="vanity.c40.s2">For though the old Baronet survived many months, he never recovered the use of his intellect or his speech completely, and the government of the estate devolved upon his elder son.</s> <s sid="3" id="vanity.c40.s3">In a strange condition Pitt found it.</s> <s sid="4" id="vanity.c40.s4">Sir Pitt was always buying and mortgaging; he had twenty men of business, and quarrels with each; quarrels with all his tenants, and lawsuits with them; lawsuits with the lawyers; lawsuits with the Mining and Dock Companies in which he was proprietor; and with every person with whom he had business.</s> <s sid="5" id="vanity.c40.s5">To unravel these difficulties and to set the estate clear was a task worthy of the orderly and persevering diplomatist of Pumpernickel, and he set himself to work with prodigious assiduity.</s> <s sid="6" id="vanity.c40.s6">His whole family, of course, was transported to Queen's Crawley, whither Lady Southdown, of course, came too; and she set about converting the parish under the Rector's nose, and brought down her irregular clergy to the dismay of the angry Mrs Bute.</s> <s sid="7" id="vanity.c40.s7">Sir Pitt had concluded no bargain for the sale of the living of Queen's Crawley; when it should drop, her Ladyship proposed to take the patronage into her own hands and present a young protege to the Rectory, on which subject the diplomatic Pitt said nothing.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vanity.c40.p2"><s sid="8" id="vanity.c40.s8">Mrs. Bute's intentions with regard to Miss Betsy Horrocks were not carried into effect, and she paid no visit to Southampton Gaol.</s> <s sid="9" id="vanity.c40.s9">She and her father left the Hall when the latter took possession of the Crawley Arms in the village, of which he had got a lease from Sir Pitt.</s> <s sid="10" id="vanity.c40.s10">The ex-butler had obtained a small freehold there likewise, which gave him a vote for the borough.</s> <s sid="11" id="vanity.c40.s11">The Rector had another of these votes, and these and four others formed the representative body which returned the two members for Queen's Crawley.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vanity.c40.p3"><s sid="12" id="vanity.c40.s12">There was a show of courtesy kept up between the Rectory and the Hall ladies, between the younger ones at least, for Mrs. Bute and Lady Southdown never could meet without battles, and gradually ceased seeing each other.</s> <s sid="13" id="vanity.c40.s13">Her Ladyship kept her room when the ladies from the Rectory visited their cousins at the Hall.</s> <s sid="14" id="vanity.c40.s14">Perhaps Mr. Pitt was not very much displeased at these occasional absences of his mamma-in-law.</s> <s sid="15" id="vanity.c40.s15">He believed the Binkie family to be the greatest and wisest and most interesting in the world, and her Ladyship and his aunt had long held ascendency over him; but sometimes he felt that she commanded him too much.</s> <s sid="16" id="vanity.c40.s16">To be considered young was complimentary, doubtless, but at six-and-forty to be treated as a boy was sometimes mortifying.</s> <s sid="17" id="vanity.c40.s17">Lady Jane yielded up everything, however, to her mother.</s> <s sid="18" id="vanity.c40.s18">She was only fond of her children in private, and it was lucky for her that Lady Southdown's multifarious business, her conferences with ministers, and her correspondence with all the missionaries of Africa, Asia, and Australasia, &amp;c., occupied the venerable Countess a great deal, so that she had but little time to devote to her granddaughter, the little Matilda, and her grandson, Master Pitt Crawley.</s> <s sid="19" id="vanity.c40.s19">The latter was a feeble child, and it was only by prodigious quantities of calomel that Lady Southdown was able to keep him in life at all.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="vanity.c40.p4"><s sid="20" id="vanity.c40.s20">As for Sir Pitt he retired into those very apartments where Lady Crawley had been previously extinguished, and here was tended by Miss Hester, the girl upon her promotion, with constant care and assiduity.</s> <s sid="21" id="vanity.c40.s21">What love, what fidelity, what constancy is there equal to that of a nurse with good wages?</s> <s sid="22" id="vanity.c40.s22">They smooth pillows; and make arrowroot; they get up at nights; they bear complaints and querulousness; they see the sun shining out of doors and don't want to go abroad; they sleep on arm-chairs and eat their meals in solitude; they pass long long evenings doing nothing, watching the embers, and the patient's drink simmering in the jug; they read the weekly paper the whole week through; and Law's Serious Call or the Whole Duty of Man suffices them for literature for the year--and we quarrel with them because, when their relations come to see them once a week, a little gin is smuggled in in their linen basket.</s> <s sid="23" id="vanity.c40.s23">Ladies, what man's love is there that would stand a year's nursing of the object of his affection?</s> <s sid="24" id="vanity.c40.s24">Whereas a nurse will stand by you for ten pounds a quarter, and we think her too highly paid.</s> <s sid="25" id="vanity.c40.s25">At least Mr. Crawley grumbled a good deal about paying half as much to Miss Hester for her constant attendance upon the Baronet his father.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="vanity.c40.p5" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="vanity.c40.s26">Of sunshiny days this old gentleman was taken out in a chair on the terrace--the very chair which Miss Crawley had had at Brighton, and which had been transported thence with a number of Lady Southdown's effects to Queen's Crawley.</s> <s sid="27" id="vanity.c40.s27">Lady Jane always walked by the old man, and was an evident favourite with him.</s> <s sid="28" id="vanity.c40.s28">He used to nod many times to her and smile when she came in, and utter inarticulate deprecatory moans when she was going away.</s> <s sid="29" id="vanity.c40.s29">When the door shut upon her he would cry and sob--whereupon Hester's face and manner, which was always exceedingly bland and gentle while her lady was present, would change at once, and she would make faces at him and clench her fist and scream out <qs/>"Hold your tongue, you stoopid old fool,"<qe/> and twirl away his chair from the fire which he loved to look at--at which he would cry more.</s> <s sid="30" id="vanity.c40.s30">For this was all that was left after more than seventy years of cunning, and struggling, and drinking, and scheming, and sin and selfishness--a whimpering old idiot put in and out of bed and cleaned and fed like a baby.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="vanity.c40.p6"><s sid="31" id="vanity.c40.s31">At last a day came when the nurse's occupation was over.</s> <s sid="32" id="vanity.c40.s32">Early one morning, as Pitt Crawley was at his steward's and bailiff's books in the study, a knock came to the door, and Hester presented herself, dropping a curtsey, and said,</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="vanity.c40.p8" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="vanity.c40.s35">What was it that made Pitt's pale face flush quite red?</s> <s sid="36" id="vanity.c40.s36">Was it because he was Sir Pitt at last, with a seat in Parliament, and perhaps future honours in prospect?</s> <s sid="37" id="vanity.c40.s37"><qs/>"I'll clear the estate now with the ready money,"<qe/> he thought and rapidly calculated its incumbrances and the improvements which he would make.</s> <s sid="38" id="vanity.c40.s38">He would not use his aunt's money previously lest Sir Pitt should recover and his outlay be in vain.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="vanity.c40.p9"><s sid="39" id="vanity.c40.s39">All the blinds were pulled down at the Hall and Rectory: the church bell was tolled, and the chancel hung in black; and Bute Crawley didn't go to a coursing meeting, but went and dined quietly at Fuddleston, where they talked about his deceased brother and young Sir Pitt over their port.</s> <s sid="40" id="vanity.c40.s40">Miss Betsy, who was by this time married to a saddler at Mudbury, cried a good deal.</s> <s sid="41" id="vanity.c40.s41">The family surgeon rode over and paid his respectful compliments, and inquiries for the health of their ladyships.</s> <s sid="42" id="vanity.c40.s42">The death was talked about at Mudbury and at the Crawley Arms, the landlord whereof had become reconciled with the Rector of late, who was occasionally known to step into the parlour and taste Mr. Horrocks' mild beer.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="vanity.c40.p15" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="vanity.c40.s48"><qs/>"Not whilst I am in the house!"<qe/> said Lady Southdown.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="vanity.c40.p17" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="vanity.c40.s51"><qs/>"Jane, I forbid you to put pen to paper!"<qe/> cried the Countess.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="vanity.c40.p45" type="speech"><s sid="121" id="vanity.c40.s121">Briggs tried to live with her relations in the country, but found that attempt was vain after the better society to which she had been accustomed.</s> <s sid="122" id="vanity.c40.s122">Briggs's friends, small tradesmen, in a country town, quarrelled over Miss Briggs's forty pounds a year as eagerly and more openly than Miss Crawley's kinsfolk had for that lady's inheritance.</s> <s sid="123" id="vanity.c40.s123">Briggs's brother, a radical hatter and grocer, called his sister a purse-proud aristocrat, because she would not advance a part of her capital to stock his shop; and she would have done so most likely, but that their sister, a dissenting shoemaker's lady, at variance with the hatter and grocer, who went to another chapel, showed how their brother was on the verge of bankruptcy, and took possession of Briggs for a while.</s> <s sid="124" id="vanity.c40.s124">The dissenting shoemaker wanted Miss Briggs to send his son to college and make a gentleman of him.</s> <s sid="125" id="vanity.c40.s125">Between them the two families got a great portion of her private savings out of her, and finally she fled to London followed by the anathemas of both, and determined to seek for servitude again as infinitely less onerous than liberty.</s> <s sid="126" id="vanity.c40.s126">And advertising in the papers that a <qs/>"Gentlewoman of agreeable manners, and accustomed to the best society, was anxious to,"<qe/> &amp;c., she took up her residence with Mr. Bowls in Half Moon Street, and waited the result of the advertisement.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="vanity.c40.p48"><s sid="131" id="vanity.c40.s131">Briggs told all her history amidst those perfectly uncalled-for sobs and ejaculations of wonder with which women of her soft nature salute an old acquaintance, or regard a rencontre in the street; for though people meet other people every day, yet some there are who insist upon discovering miracles; and women, even though they have disliked each other, begin to cry when they meet, deploring and remembering the time when they last quarrelled.</s> <s sid="132" id="vanity.c40.s132">So, in a word, Briggs told all her history, and Becky gave a narrative of her own life, with her usual artlessness and candour.</s> </p>

She had flirted all the way to Madras with the Captain and chief mate of the Ramchunder East Indiaman, and had a season at the Presidency with her brother and Mrs. O'Dowd, who was staying there, while the Major of the regiment was in command at the station.</s> <s sid="28" id="vanity.c43.s28">Everybody admired her there; everybody danced with her; but no one proposed who was worth the marrying--one or two exceedingly young subalterns sighed after her, and a beardless civilian or two, but she rejected these as beneath her pretensions--and other and younger virgins than Glorvina were married before her.</s> <s sid="29" id="vanity.c43.s29">There are women, and handsome women too, who have this fortune in life.</s> <s sid="30" id="vanity.c43.s30">They fall in love with the utmost generosity; they ride and walk with half the Army-list, though they draw near to forty, and yet the Misses O'Grady are the Misses O'Grady still:</s> <s sid="31" id="vanity.c43.s31">Glorvina persisted that but for Lady O'Dowd's unlucky quarrel with the Judge's lady, she would have made a good match at Madras, where old Mr. Chutney, who was at the head of the civil service (and who afterwards married Miss Dolby, a young lady only thirteen years of age who had just arrived from school in Europe), was just at the point of proposing to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="vanity.c48.p10"><s sid="54" id="vanity.c48.s54">The brocade was an old remnant, Becky said; and as for the lace, it was a great bargain.</s> <s sid="55" id="vanity.c48.s55">She had had it these hundred years.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="vanity.c49.p23"><s sid="92" id="vanity.c49.s92">Becky took it, however, with grateful humility, and performing a reverence which would have done credit to the best dancer-master, put herself at Lady Steyne's feet, as it were, by saying that his Lordship had been her father's earliest friend and patron, and that she, Becky, had learned to honour and respect the Steyne family from the days of her childhood.</s> <s sid="93" id="vanity.c49.s93">The fact is that Lord Steyne had once purchased a couple of pictures of the late Sharp, and the affectionate orphan could never forget her gratitude for that favour.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="vanity.c50.p1"><s sid="1" id="vanity.c50.s1">The Muse, whoever she be, who presides over this Comic History must now descend from the genteel heights in which she has been soaring and have the goodness to drop down upon the lowly roof of John Sedley at Brompton, and describe what events are taking place there.</s> <s sid="2" id="vanity.c50.s2">Here, too, in this humble tenement, live care, and distrust, and dismay.</s> <s sid="3" id="vanity.c50.s3">Mrs. Clapp in the kitchen is grumbling in secret to her husband about the rent, and urging the good fellow to rebel against his old friend and patron and his present lodger.</s> <s sid="4" id="vanity.c50.s4">Mrs. Sedley has ceased to visit her landlady in the lower regions now, and indeed is in a position to patronize Mrs. Clapp no longer.</s> <s sid="5" id="vanity.c50.s5">How can one be condescending to a lady to whom one owes a matter of forty pounds, and who is perpetually throwing out hints for the money?</s> <s sid="6" id="vanity.c50.s6">The Irish maidservant has not altered in the least in her kind and respectful behaviour; but Mrs. Sedley fancies that she is growing insolent and ungrateful, and, as the guilty thief who fears each bush an officer, sees threatening innuendoes and hints of capture in all the girl's speeches and answers.</s> <s sid="7" id="vanity.c50.s7">Miss Clapp, grown quite a young woman now, is declared by the soured old lady to be an unbearable and impudent little minx.</s> <s sid="8" id="vanity.c50.s8">Why Amelia can be so fond of her, or have her in her room so much, or walk out with her so constantly, Mrs. Sedley cannot conceive.</s> <s sid="9" id="vanity.c50.s9">The bitterness of poverty has poisoned the life of the once cheerful and kindly woman.</s> <s sid="10" id="vanity.c50.s10">She is thankless for Amelia's constant and gentle bearing towards her; carps at her for her efforts at kindness or service; rails at her for her silly pride in her child and her neglect of her parents.</s> <s sid="11" id="vanity.c50.s11">Georgy's house is not a very lively one since Uncle Jos's annuity has been withdrawn and the little family are almost upon famine diet.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vanity.c50.p2" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="vanity.c50.s12">Amelia thinks, and thinks, and racks her brain, to find some means of increasing the small pittance upon which the household is starving.</s> <s sid="13" id="vanity.c50.s13">Can she give lessons in anything? paint card-racks? do fine work?</s> <s sid="14" id="vanity.c50.s14">She finds that women are working hard, and better than she can, for twopence a day.</s> <s sid="15" id="vanity.c50.s15">She buys a couple of begilt Bristol boards at the Fancy Stationer's and paints her very best upon them-- a shepherd with a red waistcoat on one, and a pink face smiling in the midst of a pencil landscape--a shepherdess on the other, crossing a little bridge, with a little dog, nicely shaded.</s> <s sid="16" id="vanity.c50.s16">The man of the Fancy Repository and Brompton Emporium of Fine Arts (of whom she bought the screens, vainly hoping that he would repurchase them when ornamented by her hand) can hardly hide the sneer with which he examines these feeble works of art.</s> <s sid="17" id="vanity.c50.s17">He looks askance at the lady who waits in the shop, and ties up the cards again in their envelope of whitey-brown paper, and hands them to the poor widow and Miss Clapp, who had never seen such beautiful things in her life, and had been quite confident that the man must give at least two guineas for the screens.</s> <s sid="18" id="vanity.c50.s18">They try at other shops in the interior of London, with faint sickening hopes.</s> <s sid="19" id="vanity.c50.s19"><qs/>"Don't want 'em,"<qe/> says one.</s> <s sid="20" id="vanity.c50.s20"><qs/>"Be off,"<qe/> says another fiercely.</s> <s sid="21" id="vanity.c50.s21">Three-and-sixpence has been spent in vain-- the screens retire to Miss Clapp's bedroom, who persists in thinking them lovely.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vanity.c50.p3"><s sid="22" id="vanity.c50.s22">She writes out a little card in her neatest hand, and after long thought and labour of composition, in which the public is informed that "A Lady who has some time at her disposal, wishes to undertake the education of some little girls, whom she would instruct in English, in French, in Geography, in History, and in Music--address A.  O., at Mr. Brown's"; and she confides the card to the gentleman of the Fine Art Repository, who consents to allow it to lie upon the counter, where it grows dingy and fly-blown.</s> <s sid="23" id="vanity.c50.s23">Amelia passes the door wistfully many a time, in hopes that Mr. Brown will have some news to give her, but he never beckons her in.</s> <s sid="24" id="vanity.c50.s24">When she goes to make little purchases, there is no news for her.</s> <s sid="25" id="vanity.c50.s25">Poor simple lady, tender and weak--how are you to battle with the struggling violent world?</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="vanity.c50.p4"><s sid="26" id="vanity.c50.s26">She grows daily more care-worn and sad, fixing upon her child alarmed eyes, whereof the little boy cannot interpret the expression.</s> <s sid="27" id="vanity.c50.s27">She starts up of a night and peeps into his room stealthily, to see that he is sleeping and not stolen away.</s> <s sid="28" id="vanity.c50.s28">She sleeps but little now.</s> <s sid="29" id="vanity.c50.s29">A constant thought and terror is haunting her.</s> <s sid="30" id="vanity.c50.s30">How she weeps and prays in the long silent nights--how she tries to hide from herself the thought which will return to her, that she ought to part with the boy, that she is the only barrier between him and prosperity.</s> <s sid="31" id="vanity.c50.s31">She can't, she can't.</s> <s sid="32" id="vanity.c50.s32">Not now, at least.</s> <s sid="33" id="vanity.c50.s33">Some other day.</s> <s sid="34" id="vanity.c50.s34">Oh! it is too hard to think of and to bear.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="vanity.c50.p5"><s sid="35" id="vanity.c50.s35">A thought comes over her which makes her blush and turn from herself--her parents might keep the annuity--the curate would marry her and give a home to her and the boy.</s> <s sid="36" id="vanity.c50.s36">But George's picture and dearest memory are there to rebuke her.</s> <s sid="37" id="vanity.c50.s37">Shame and love say no to the sacrifice.</s> <s sid="38" id="vanity.c50.s38">She shrinks from it as from something unholy, and such thoughts never found a resting-place in that pure and gentle bosom.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="vanity.c50.p6"><s sid="39" id="vanity.c50.s39">The combat, which we describe in a sentence or two, lasted for many weeks in poor Amelia's heart, during which she had no confidante; indeed, she could never have one, as she would not allow to herself the possibility of yielding, though she was giving way daily before the enemy with whom she had to battle.</s> <s sid="40" id="vanity.c50.s40">One truth after another was marshalling itself silently against her and keeping its ground.</s> <s sid="41" id="vanity.c50.s41">Poverty and misery for all, want and degradation for her parents, injustice to the boy--one by one the outworks of the little citadel were taken, in which the poor soul passionately guarded her only love and treasure.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="vanity.c50.p7"><s sid="42" id="vanity.c50.s42">At the beginning of the struggle, she had written off a letter of tender supplication to her brother at Calcutta, imploring him not to withdraw the support which he had granted to their parents and painting in terms of artless pathos their lonely and hapless condition.</s> <s sid="43" id="vanity.c50.s43">She did not know the truth of the matter.</s> <s sid="44" id="vanity.c50.s44">The payment of Jos's annuity was still regular, but it was a money-lender in the City who was receiving it:  old Sedley had sold it for a sum of money wherewith to prosecute his bootless schemes.</s> <s sid="45" id="vanity.c50.s45">Emmy was calculating eagerly the time that would elapse before the letter would arrive and be answered.</s> <s sid="46" id="vanity.c50.s46">She had written down the date in her pocket-book of the day when she dispatched it.</s> <s sid="47" id="vanity.c50.s47">To her son's guardian, the good Major at Madras, she had not communicated any of her griefs and perplexities.</s> <s sid="48" id="vanity.c50.s48">She had not written to him since she wrote to congratulate him on his approaching marriage.</s> <s sid="49" id="vanity.c50.s49">She thought with sickening despondency, that that friend--the only one, the one who had felt such a regard for her--was fallen away.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="vanity.c50.p8"><s sid="50" id="vanity.c50.s50">One day, when things had come to a very bad pass--when the creditors were pressing, the mother in hysteric grief, the father in more than usual gloom, the inmates of the family avoiding each other, each secretly oppressed with his private unhappiness and notion of wrong --the father and daughter happened to be left alone together, and Amelia thought to comfort her father by telling him what she had done.</s> <s sid="51" id="vanity.c50.s51">She had written to Joseph--an answer must come in three or four months.</s> <s sid="52" id="vanity.c50.s52">He was always generous, though careless.</s> <s sid="53" id="vanity.c50.s53">He could not refuse, when he knew how straitened were the circumstances of his parents.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="vanity.c50.p9" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="vanity.c50.s54">Then the poor old gentleman revealed the whole truth to her--that his son was still paying the annuity, which his own imprudence had flung away.</s> <s sid="55" id="vanity.c50.s55">He had not dared to tell it sooner.</s> <s sid="56" id="vanity.c50.s56">He thought Amelia's ghastly and terrified look, when, with a trembling, miserable voice he made the confession, conveyed reproaches to him for his concealment.</s> <s sid="57" id="vanity.c50.s57"><qs/>"Ah!"<qe/><sls/> said he with quivering lips and turning away, <sle/><qs/>"you despise your old father now!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="vanity.c50.p10" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="vanity.c50.s58"><qs/>"Oh, papal it is not that,"<qe/> Amelia cried out, falling on his neck and kissing him many times.</s> <s sid="59" id="vanity.c50.s59">"You are always good and kind.</s> <s sid="60" id="vanity.c50.s60">You did it for the best.</s> <s sid="61" id="vanity.c50.s61">It is not for the money--it is--my God! my God! have mercy upon me, and give me strength to bear this trial"; and she kissed him again wildly and went away.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="vanity.c50.p11"><s sid="62" id="vanity.c50.s62">Still the father did not know what that explanation meant, and the burst of anguish with which the poor girl left him.</s> <s sid="63" id="vanity.c50.s63">It was that she was conquered.</s> <s sid="64" id="vanity.c50.s64">The sentence was passed.</s> <s sid="65" id="vanity.c50.s65">The child must go from her--to others--to forget her.</s> <s sid="66" id="vanity.c50.s66">Her heart and her treasure--her joy, hope, love, worship--her God, almost!</s> <s sid="67" id="vanity.c50.s67">She must give him up, and then--and then she would go to George, and they would watch over the child and wait for him until he came to them in Heaven.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="vanity.c50.p12" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="vanity.c50.s68">She put on her bonnet, scarcely knowing what she did, and went out to walk in the lanes by which George used to come back from school, and where she was in the habit of going on his return to meet the boy.</s> <s sid="69" id="vanity.c50.s69">It was May, a half-holiday.</s> <s sid="70" id="vanity.c50.s70">The leaves were all coming out, the weather was brilliant; the boy came running to her flushed with health, singing, his bundle of school-books hanging by a thong.</s> <s sid="71" id="vanity.c50.s71">There he was.</s> <s sid="72" id="vanity.c50.s72">Both her arms were round him.</s> <s sid="73" id="vanity.c50.s73">No, it was impossible.</s> <s sid="74" id="vanity.c50.s74">They could not be going to part.</s> <s sid="75" id="vanity.c50.s75"><qs/>"What is the matter, Mother?"<qe/><sss/> said he; <sse/><qs/>"you look very pale."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vanity.c52.p2"><s sid="10" id="vanity.c52.s10">Of this famous house, some of the greatest noblemen, prelates, and dignitaries in England are governors:  and as the boys are very comfortably lodged, fed, and educated, and subsequently inducted to good scholarships at the University and livings in the Church, many little gentlemen are devoted to the ecclesiastical profession from their tenderest years, and there is considerable emulation to procure nominations for the foundation.</s> <s sid="11" id="vanity.c52.s11">It was originally intended for the sons of poor and deserving clerics and laics, but many of the noble governors of the Institution, with an enlarged and rather capricious benevolence, selected all sorts of objects for their bounty.</s> <s sid="12" id="vanity.c52.s12">To get an education for nothing, and a future livelihood and profession assured, was so excellent a scheme that some of the richest people did not disdain it; and not only great men's relations, but great men themselves, sent their sons to profit by the chance--Right Rev.  prelates sent their own kinsmen or the sons of their clergy, while, on the other hand, some great noblemen did not disdain to patronize the children of their confidential servants--so that a lad entering this establishment had every variety of youthful society wherewith to mingle.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="vanity.c56.p7"><s sid="32" id="vanity.c56.s32">Though he was scarcely eleven years of age, Master George wore straps and the most beautiful little boots like a man.</s> <s sid="33" id="vanity.c56.s33">He had gilt spurs, and a gold-headed whip, and a fine pin in his handkerchief, and the neatest little kid gloves which Lamb's Conduit Street could furnish.</s> <s sid="34" id="vanity.c56.s34">His mother had given him a couple of neckcloths, and carefully hemmed and made some little shirts for him; but when her Eli came to see the widow, they were replaced by much finer linen.</s> <s sid="35" id="vanity.c56.s35">He had little jewelled buttons in the lawn shirt fronts.</s> <s sid="36" id="vanity.c56.s36">Her humble presents had been put aside--I believe Miss Osborne had given them to the coachman's boy.</s> <s sid="37" id="vanity.c56.s37">Amelia tried to think she was pleased at the change.</s> <s sid="38" id="vanity.c56.s38">Indeed, she was happy and charmed to see the boy looking so beautiful.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="vanity.c63.p1"><s sid="1" id="vanity.c63.s1">Such polite behaviour as that of Lord Tapeworm did not fail to have the most favourable effect upon Mr. Sedley's mind, and the very next morning, at breakfast, he pronounced his opinion that Pumpernickel was the pleasantest little place of any which he had visited on their tour.</s> <s sid="2" id="vanity.c63.s2">Jos's motives and artifices were not very difficult of comprehension, and Dobbin laughed in his sleeve, like a hypocrite as he was, when he found, by the knowing air of the civilian and the offhand manner in which the latter talked about Tapeworm Castle and the other members of the family, that Jos had been up already in the morning, consulting his travelling Peerage.</s> <s sid="3" id="vanity.c63.s3">Yes, he had seen the Right Honourable the Earl of Bagwig, his lordship's father; he was sure he had, he had met him at--at the Levee--didn't Dob remember? and when the Diplomatist called on the party, faithful to his promise, Jos received him with such a salute and honours as were seldom accorded to the little Envoy.</s> <s sid="4" id="vanity.c63.s4">He winked at Kirsch on his Excellency's arrival, and that emissary, instructed before-hand, went out and superintended an entertainment of cold meats, jellies, and other delicacies, brought in upon trays, and of which Mr. Jos absolutely insisted that his noble guest should partake.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vanity.c63.p2"><s sid="5" id="vanity.c63.s5">Tapeworm, so long as he could have an opportunity of admiring the bright eyes of Mrs. Osborne (whose freshness of complexion bore daylight remarkably well) was not ill pleased to accept any invitation to stay in Mr. Sedley's lodgings; he put one or two dexterous questions to him about India and the dancing-girls there; asked Amelia about that beautiful boy who had been with her; and complimented the astonished little woman upon the prodigious sensation which she had made in the house; and tried to fascinate Dobbin by talking of the late war and the exploits of the Pumpernickel contingent under the command of the Hereditary Prince, now Duke of Pumpernickel.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vanity.c63.p3" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="vanity.c63.s6">Lord Tapeworm inherited no little portion of the family gallantry, and it was his happy belief that almost every woman upon whom he himself cast friendly eyes was in love with him.</s> <s sid="7" id="vanity.c63.s7">He left Emmy under the persuasion that she was slain by his wit and attractions and went home to his lodgings to write a pretty little note to her.</s> <s sid="8" id="vanity.c63.s8">She was not fascinated, only puzzled, by his grinning, his simpering, his scented cambric handkerchief, and his high-heeled lacquered boots.</s> <s sid="9" id="vanity.c63.s9">She did not understand one-half the compliments which he paid; she had never, in her small experience of mankind, met a professional ladies' man as yet, and looked upon my lord as something curious rather than pleasant; and if she did not admire, certainly wondered at him.</s> <s sid="10" id="vanity.c63.s10">Jos, on the contrary, was delighted.</s> <s sid="11" id="vanity.c63.s11"><qs/>"How very affable his Lordship is,"<qe/><sss/> he said; <sse/><qs/>"How very kind of his Lordship to say he would send his medical man!</s> <s sid="12" id="vanity.c63.s12">Kirsch, you will carry our cards to the Count de Schlusselback directly; the Major and I will have the greatest pleasure in paying our respects at Court as soon as possible.</s> <s sid="13" id="vanity.c63.s13">Put out my uniform, Kirsch--both our uniforms.</s> <s sid="14" id="vanity.c63.s14">It is a mark of politeness which every English gentleman ought to show to the countries which he visits to pay his respects to the sovereigns of those countries as to the representatives of his own."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="vanity.c63.p4" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="vanity.c63.s15">When Tapeworm's doctor came, Doctor von Glauber, Body Physician to H.S.H.  the Duke, he speedily convinced Jos that the Pumpernickel mineral springs and the Doctor's particular treatment would infallibly restore the Bengalee to youth and slimness.</s> <s sid="16" id="vanity.c63.s16"><qs/>"Dere came here last year,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"Sheneral Bulkeley, an English Sheneral, tvice so pic as you, sir.</s> <s sid="17" id="vanity.c63.s17">I sent him back qvite tin after tree months, and he danced vid Baroness Glauber at the end of two."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="vanity.c63.p5"><s sid="18" id="vanity.c63.s18">Jos's mind was made up; the springs, the Doctor, the Court, and the Charge d'Affaires convinced him, and he proposed to spend the autumn in these delightful quarters.</s> <s sid="19" id="vanity.c63.s19">And punctual to his word, on the next day the Charge d'Affaires presented Jos and the Major to Victor Aurelius XVII, being conducted to their audience with that sovereign by the Count de Schlusselback, Marshal of the Court.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="vanity.c63.p6"><s sid="20" id="vanity.c63.s20">They were straightway invited to dinner at Court, and their intention of staying in the town being announced, the politest ladies of the whole town instantly called upon Mrs. Osborne; and as not one of these, however poor they might be, was under the rank of a Baroness, Jos's delight was beyond expression.</s> <s sid="21" id="vanity.c63.s21">He wrote off to Chutney at the Club to say that the Service was highly appreciated in Germany, that he was going to show his friend, the Count de Schlusselback, how to stick a pig in the Indian fashion, and that his august friends, the Duke and Duchess, were everything that was kind and civil.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="vanity.c63.p7"><s sid="22" id="vanity.c63.s22">Emmy, too, was presented to the august family, and as mourning is not admitted in Court on certain days, she appeared in a pink crape dress with a diamond ornament in the corsage, presented to her by her brother, and she looked so pretty in this costume that the Duke and Court (putting out of the question the Major, who had scarcely ever seen her before in an evening dress, and vowed that she did not look five-and-twenty) all admired her excessively.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="vanity.c63.p8"><s sid="23" id="vanity.c63.s23">In this dress she walked a Polonaise with Major Dobbin at a Court ball, in which easy dance Mr. Jos had the honour of leading out the Countess of Schlusselback, an old lady with a hump back, but with sixteen good quarters of nobility and related to half the royal houses of Germany.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="vanity.c63.p9"><s sid="24" id="vanity.c63.s24">Pumpernickel stands in the midst of a happy valley through which sparkles--to mingle with the Rhine somewhere, but I have not the map at hand to say exactly at what point--the fertilizing stream of the Pump.</s> <s sid="25" id="vanity.c63.s25">In some places the river is big enough to support a ferry- boat, in others to turn a mill; in Pumpernickel itself, the last Transparency but three, the great and renowned Victor Aurelius XIV built a magnificent bridge, on which his own statue rises, surrounded by water-nymphs and emblems of victory, peace, and plenty; he has his foot on the neck of a prostrate Turk--history says he engaged and ran a Janissary through the body at the relief of Vienna by Sobieski--but, quite undisturbed by the agonies of that prostrate Mahometan, who writhes at his feet in the most ghastly manner, the Prince smiles blandly and points with his truncheon in the direction of the Aurelius Platz, where he began to erect a new palace that would have been the wonder of his age had the great- souled Prince but had funds to complete it.</s> <s sid="26" id="vanity.c63.s26">But the completion of Monplaisir (Monblaisir the honest German folks call it) was stopped for lack of ready money, and it and its park and garden are now in rather a faded condition, and not more than ten times big enough to accommodate the Court of the reigning Sovereign.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="vanity.c63.p10"><s sid="27" id="vanity.c63.s27">The gardens were arranged to emulate those of Versailles, and amidst the terraces and groves there are some huge allegorical waterworks still, which spout and froth stupendously upon fete-days, and frighten one with their enormous aquatic insurrections.</s> <s sid="28" id="vanity.c63.s28">There is the Trophonius' cave in which, by some artifice, the leaden Tritons are made not only to spout water, but to play the most dreadful groans out of their lead conchs--there is the nymphbath and the Niagara cataract, which the people of the neighbourhood admire beyond expression, when they come to the yearly fair at the opening of the Chamber, or to the fetes with which the happy little nation still celebrates the birthdays and marriage-days of its princely governors.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="vanity.c63.p11"><s sid="29" id="vanity.c63.s29">Then from all the towns of the Duchy, which stretches for nearly ten mile--from Bolkum, which lies on its western frontier bidding defiance to Prussia, from Grogwitz, where the Prince has a hunting- lodge, and where his dominions are separated by the Pump River from those of the neighbouring Prince of Potzenthal; from all the little villages, which besides these three great cities, dot over the happy principality--from the farms and the mills along the Pump come troops of people in red petticoats and velvet head-dresses, or with three-cornered hats and pipes in their mouths, who flock to the Residenz and share in the pleasures of the fair and the festivities there.</s> <s sid="30" id="vanity.c63.s30">Then the theatre is open for nothing, then the waters of Monblaisir begin to play (it is lucky that there is company to behold them, for one would be afraid to see them alone)--then there come mountebanks and riding troops (the way in which his Transparency was fascinated by one of the horse-riders is well known, and it is believed that La Petite Vivandiere, as she was called, was a spy in the French interest), and the delighted people are permitted to march through room after room of the Grand Ducal palace and admire the slippery floor, the rich hangings, and the spittoons at the doors of all the innumerable chambers.</s> <s sid="31" id="vanity.c63.s31">There is one Pavilion at Monblaisir which Aurelius Victor XV had arranged--a great Prince but too fond of pleasure--and which I am told is a perfect wonder of licentious elegance.</s> <s sid="32" id="vanity.c63.s32">It is painted with the story of Bacchus and Ariadne, and the table works in and out of the room by means of a windlass, so that the company was served without any intervention of domestics.</s> <s sid="33" id="vanity.c63.s33">But the place was shut up by Barbara, Aurelius XV's widow, a severe and devout Princess of the House of Bolkum and Regent of the Duchy during her son's glorious minority, and after the death of her husband, cut off in the pride of his pleasures.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="vanity.c63.p12"><s sid="34" id="vanity.c63.s34">The theatre of Pumpernickel is known and famous in that quarter of Germany.</s> <s sid="35" id="vanity.c63.s35">It languished a little when the present Duke in his youth insisted upon having his own operas played there, and it is said one day, in a fury, from his place in the orchestra, when he attended a rehearsal, broke a bassoon on the head of the Chapel Master, who was conducting, and led too slow; and during which time the Duchess Sophia wrote domestic comedies, which must have been very dreary to witness.</s> <s sid="36" id="vanity.c63.s36">But the Prince executes his music in private now, and the Duchess only gives away her plays to the foreigners of distinction who visit her kind little Court.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="vanity.c63.p13"><s sid="37" id="vanity.c63.s37">It is conducted with no small comfort and splendour.</s> <s sid="38" id="vanity.c63.s38">When there are balls, though there may be four hundred people at supper, there is a servant in scarlet and lace to attend upon every four, and every one is served on silver.</s> <s sid="39" id="vanity.c63.s39">There are festivals and entertainments going continually on, and the Duke has his chamberlains and equerries, and the Duchess her mistress of the wardrobe and ladies of honour, just like any other and more potent potentates.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="vanity.c63.p14"><s sid="40" id="vanity.c63.s40">The Constitution is or was a moderate despotism, tempered by a Chamber that might or might not be elected.</s> <s sid="41" id="vanity.c63.s41">I never certainly could hear of its sitting in my time at Pumpernickel.</s> <s sid="42" id="vanity.c63.s42">The Prime Minister had lodgings in a second floor, and the Foreign Secretary occupied the comfortable lodgings over Zwieback's Conditorey.</s> <s sid="43" id="vanity.c63.s43">The army consisted of a magnificent band that also did duty on the stage, where it was quite pleasant to see the worthy fellows marching in Turkish dresses with rouge on and wooden scimitars, or as Roman warriors with ophicleides and trombones--to see them again, I say, at night, after one had listened to them all the morning in the Aurelius Platz, where they performed opposite the cafe where we breakfasted.</s> <s sid="44" id="vanity.c63.s44">Besides the band, there was a rich and numerous staff of officers, and, I believe, a few men.</s> <s sid="45" id="vanity.c63.s45">Besides the regular sentries, three or four men, habited as hussars, used to do duty at the Palace, but I never saw them on horseback, and au fait, what was the use of cavalry in a time of profound peace?--and whither the deuce should the hussars ride?</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="vanity.c63.p15"><s sid="46" id="vanity.c63.s46">Everybody--everybody that was noble of course, for as for the bourgeois we could not quite be expected to take notice of THEM-- visited his neighbour.</s> <s sid="47" id="vanity.c63.s47">H. E.</s> <s sid="48" id="vanity.c63.s48">Madame de Burst received once a week, H. E.</s> <s sid="49" id="vanity.c63.s49">Madame de Schnurrbart had her night--the theatre was open twice a week, the Court graciously received once, so that a man's life might in fact be a perfect round of pleasure in the unpretending Pumpernickel way.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="vanity.c63.p16"><s sid="50" id="vanity.c63.s50">That there were feuds in the place, no one can deny.</s> <s sid="51" id="vanity.c63.s51">Politics ran very high at Pumpernickel, and parties were very bitter.</s> <s sid="52" id="vanity.c63.s52">There was the Strumpff faction and the Lederlung party, the one supported by our envoy and the other by the French Charge d'Affaires, M. de Macabau.</s> <s sid="53" id="vanity.c63.s53">Indeed it sufficed for our Minister to stand up for Madame Strumpff, who was clearly the greater singer of the two, and had three more notes in her voice than Madame Lederlung her rival--it sufficed, I say, for our Minister to advance any opinion to have it instantly contradicted by the French diplomatist.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="vanity.c63.p17"><s sid="54" id="vanity.c63.s54">Everybody in the town was ranged in one or other of these factions.</s> <s sid="55" id="vanity.c63.s55">The Lederlung was a prettyish little creature certainly, and her voice (what there was of it) was very sweet, and there is no doubt that the Strumpff was not in her first youth and beauty, and certainly too stout; when she came on in the last scene of the Sonnambula, for instance, in her night-chemise with a lamp in her hand, and had to go out of the window, and pass over the plank of the mill, it was all she could do to squeeze out of the window, and the plank used to bend and creak again under her weight--but how she poured out the finale of the opera!  and with what a burst of feeling she rushed into Elvino's arms--almost fit to smother him!</s> <s sid="56" id="vanity.c63.s56">Whereas the little Lederlung--but a truce to this gossip--the fact is that these two women were the two flags of the French and the English party at Pumpernickel, and the society was divided in its allegiance to those two great nations.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="vanity.c63.p18"><s sid="57" id="vanity.c63.s57">We had on our side the Home Minister, the Master of the Horse, the Duke's Private Secretary, and the Prince's Tutor; whereas of the French party were the Foreign Minister, the Commander-in-Chief's Lady, who had served under Napoleon, and the Hof-Marschall and his wife, who was glad enough to get the fashions from Pans, and always had them and her caps by M. de Macabau's courier.</s> <s sid="58" id="vanity.c63.s58">The Secretary of his Chancery was little Grignac, a young fellow, as malicious as Satan, and who made caricatures of Tapeworm in all the-albums of the place.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="vanity.c63.p19" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="vanity.c63.s59">Their headquarters and table d'hote were established at the Pariser Hof, the other inn of the town; and though, of course, these gentlemen were obliged to be civil in public, yet they cut at each other with epigrams that were as sharp as razors, as I have seen a couple of wrestlers in Devonshire, lashing at each other's shins and never showing their agony upon a muscle of their faces.</s> <s sid="60" id="vanity.c63.s60">Neither Tapeworm nor Macabau ever sent home a dispatch to his government without a most savage series of attacks upon his rival.</s> <s sid="61" id="vanity.c63.s61">For instance, on our side we would write, <qs/>"The interests of Great Britain in this place, and throughout the whole of Germany, are perilled by the continuance in office of the present French envoy; this man is of a character so infamous that he will stick at no falsehood, or hesitate at no crime, to attain his ends.</s> <s sid="62" id="vanity.c63.s62">He poisons the mind of the Court against the English minister, represents the conduct of Great Britain in the most odious and atrocious light, and is unhappily backed by a minister whose ignorance and necessities are as notorious as his influence is fatal."<qe/></s> <s sid="63" id="vanity.c63.s63">On their side they would say, "M. de Tapeworm continues his system of stupid insular arrogance and vulgar falsehood against the greatest nation in the world.</s> <s sid="64" id="vanity.c63.s64">Yesterday he was heard to speak lightly of Her Royal Highness Madame the Duchess of Berri; on a former occasion he insulted the heroic Duke of Angouleme and dared to insinuate that H.R.H.  the Duke of Orleans was conspiring against the august throne of the lilies.</s> <s sid="65" id="vanity.c63.s65">His gold is prodigated in every direction which his stupid menaces fail to frighten.</s> <s sid="66" id="vanity.c63.s66">By one and the other, he has won over creatures of the Court here--and, in fine, Pumpernickel will not be quiet, Germany tranquil, France respected, or Europe content until this poisonous viper be crushed under heel":  and so on.</s> <s sid="67" id="vanity.c63.s67">When one side or the other had written any particularly spicy dispatch, news of it was sure to slip out.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="vanity.c63.p20"><s sid="68" id="vanity.c63.s68">Before the winter was far advanced, it is actually on record that Emmy took a night and received company with great propriety and modesty.</s> <s sid="69" id="vanity.c63.s69">She had a French master, who complimented her upon the purity of her accent and her facility of learning; the fact is she had learned long ago and grounded herself subsequently in the grammar so as to be able to teach it to George; and Madam Strumpff came to give her lessons in singing, which she performed so well and with such a true voice that the Major's windows, who had lodgings opposite under the Prime Minister, were always open to hear the lesson.</s> <s sid="70" id="vanity.c63.s70">Some of the German ladies, who are very sentimental and simple in their tastes, fell in love with her and began to call her du at once.</s> <s sid="71" id="vanity.c63.s71">These are trivial details, but they relate to happy times.</s> <s sid="72" id="vanity.c63.s72">The Major made himself George's tutor and read Caesar and mathematics with him, and they had a German master and rode out of evenings by the side of Emmy's carriage--she was always too timid, and made a dreadful outcry at the slightest disturbance on horse- back.</s> <s sid="73" id="vanity.c63.s73">So she drove about with one of her dear German friends, and Jos asleep on the back-seat of the barouche.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="vanity.c63.p21"><s sid="74" id="vanity.c63.s74">He was becoming very sweet upon the Grafinn Fanny de Butterbrod, a very gentle tender-hearted and unassuming young creature, a Canoness and Countess in her own right, but with scarcely ten pounds per year to her fortune, and Fanny for her part declared that to be Amelia's sister was the greatest delight that Heaven could bestow on her, and Jos might have put a Countess's shield and coronet by the side of his own arms on his carriage and forks; when--when events occurred, and those grand fetes given upon the marriage of the Hereditary Prince of Pumpernickel with the lovely Princess Amelia of Humbourg- Schlippenschloppen took place.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="vanity.c63.p22" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="vanity.c63.s75">At this festival the magnificence displayed was such as had not been known in the little German place since the days of the prodigal Victor XIV.</s> <s sid="76" id="vanity.c63.s76">All the neighbouring Princes, Princesses, and Grandees were invited to the feast.</s> <s sid="77" id="vanity.c63.s77">Beds rose to half a crown per night in Pumpernickel, and the Army was exhausted in providing guards of honour for the Highnesses, Serenities, and Excellencies who arrived from all quarters.</s> <s sid="78" id="vanity.c63.s78">The Princess was married by proxy, at her father's residence, by the Count de Schlusselback.</s> <s sid="79" id="vanity.c63.s79">Snuff-boxes were given away in profusion (as we learned from the Court jeweller, who sold and afterwards bought them again), and bushels of the Order of Saint Michael of Pumpernickel were sent to the nobles of the Court, while hampers of the cordons and decorations of the Wheel of St.</s> <s sid="80" id="vanity.c63.s80">Catherine of Schlippenschloppen were brought to ours.</s> <s sid="81" id="vanity.c63.s81">The French envoy got both.</s> <s sid="82" id="vanity.c63.s82"><qs/>"He is covered with ribbons like a prize cart- horse,"<qe/> Tapeworm said, who was not allowed by the rules of his service to take any decorations:</s> <s sid="83" id="vanity.c63.s83"><qs/>"Let him have the cordons; but with whom is the victory?"<qe/></s> <s sid="84" id="vanity.c63.s84">The fact is, it was a triumph of British diplomacy, the French party having proposed and tried their utmost to carry a marriage with a Princess of the House of Potztausend- Donnerwetter, whom, as a matter of course, we opposed.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="vanity.c63.p23"><s sid="85" id="vanity.c63.s85">Everybody was asked to the fetes of the marriage.</s> <s sid="86" id="vanity.c63.s86">Garlands and triumphal arches were hung across the road to welcome the young bride.</s> <s sid="87" id="vanity.c63.s87">The great Saint Michael's Fountain ran with uncommonly sour wine, while that in the Artillery Place frothed with beer.</s> <s sid="88" id="vanity.c63.s88">The great waters played; and poles were put up in the park and gardens for the happy peasantry, which they might climb at their leisure, carrying off watches, silver forks, prize sausages hung with pink ribbon, &amp;c., at the top.</s> <s sid="89" id="vanity.c63.s89">Georgy got one, wrenching it off, having swarmed up the pole to the delight of the spectators, and sliding down with the rapidity of a fall of water.</s> <s sid="90" id="vanity.c63.s90">But it was for the glory's sake merely.</s> <s sid="91" id="vanity.c63.s91">The boy gave the sausage to a peasant, who had very nearly seized it, and stood at the foot of the mast, blubbering, because he was unsuccessful.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="vanity.c63.p24"><s sid="92" id="vanity.c63.s92">At the French Chancellerie they had six more lampions in their illumination than ours had; but our transparency, which represented the young Couple advancing and Discord flying away, with the most ludicrous likeness to the French Ambassador, beat the French picture hollow; and I have no doubt got Tapeworm the advancement and the Cross of the Bath which he subsequently attained.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="vanity.c63.p25"><s sid="93" id="vanity.c63.s93">Crowds of foreigners arrived for the fetes, and of English, of course.</s> <s sid="94" id="vanity.c63.s94">Besides the Court balls, public balls were given at the Town Hall and the Redoute, and in the former place there was a room for trente-et-quarante and roulette established, for the week of the festivities only, and by one of the great German companies from Ems or Aix-la-Chapelle.</s> <s sid="95" id="vanity.c63.s95">The officers or inhabitants of the town were not allowed to play at these games, but strangers, peasants, ladies were admitted, and any one who chose to lose or win money.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="vanity.c63.p26"><s sid="96" id="vanity.c63.s96">That little scapegrace Georgy Osborne amongst others, whose pockets were always full of dollars and whose relations were away at the grand festival of the Court, came to the Stadthaus Ball in company of his uncle's courier, Mr. Kirsch, and having only peeped into a play-room at Baden-Baden when he hung on Dobbin's arm, and where, of course, he was not permitted to gamble, came eagerly to this part of the entertainment and hankered round the tables where the croupiers and the punters were at work.</s> <s sid="97" id="vanity.c63.s97">Women were playing; they were masked, some of them; this license was allowed in these wild times of carnival.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="vanity.c63.p27"><s sid="98" id="vanity.c63.s98">A woman with light hair, in a low dress by no means so fresh as it had been, and with a black mask on, through the eyelets of which her eyes twinkled strangely, was seated at one of the roulette-tables with a card and a pin and a couple of florins before her.</s> <s sid="99" id="vanity.c63.s99">As the croupier called out the colour and number, she pricked on the card with great care and regularity, and only ventured her money on the colours after the red or black had come up a certain number of times.</s> <s sid="100" id="vanity.c63.s100">It was strange to look at her.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="vanity.c63.p28"><s sid="101" id="vanity.c63.s101">But in spite of her care and assiduity she guessed wrong and the last two florins followed each other under the croupier's rake, as he cried out with his inexorable voice the winning colour and number.</s> <s sid="102" id="vanity.c63.s102">She gave a sigh, a shrug with her shoulders, which were already too much out of her gown, and dashing the pin through the card on to the table, sat thrumming it for a while.</s> <s sid="103" id="vanity.c63.s103">Then she looked round her and saw Georgy's honest face staring at the scene.</s> <s sid="104" id="vanity.c63.s104">The little scamp!</s> <s sid="105" id="vanity.c63.s105">What business had he to be there?</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER LXIV A Vagabond Chapter</title>

<p pid="1" id="vanity.c64.p1"><s sid="1" id="vanity.c64.s1">We must pass over a part of Mrs. Rebecca Crawley's biography with that lightness and delicacy which the world demands--the moral world, that has, perhaps, no particular objection to vice, but an insuperable repugnance to hearing vice called by its proper name.</s> <s sid="2" id="vanity.c64.s2">There are things we do and know perfectly well in Vanity Fair, though we never speak of them:  as the Ahrimanians worship the devil, but don't mention him:  and a polite public will no more bear to read an authentic description of vice than a truly refined English or American female will permit the word breeches to be pronounced in her chaste hearing.</s> <s sid="3" id="vanity.c64.s3">And yet, madam, both are walking the world before our faces every day, without much shocking us.</s> <s sid="4" id="vanity.c64.s4">If you were to blush every time they went by, what complexions you would have!</s> <s sid="5" id="vanity.c64.s5">It is only when their naughty names are called out that your modesty has any occasion to show alarm or sense of outrage, and it has been the wish of the present writer, all through this story, deferentially to submit to the fashion at present prevailing, and only to hint at the existence of wickedness in a light, easy, and agreeable manner, so that nobody's fine feelings may be offended.</s> <s sid="6" id="vanity.c64.s6">I defy any one to say that our Becky, who has certainly some vices, has not been presented to the public in a perfectly genteel and inoffensive manner.</s> <s sid="7" id="vanity.c64.s7">In describing this Siren, singing and smiling, coaxing and cajoling, the author, with modest pride, asks his readers all round, has he once forgotten the laws of politeness, and showed the monster's hideous tail above water?</s> <s sid="8" id="vanity.c64.s8">No!</s> <s sid="9" id="vanity.c64.s9">Those who like may peep down under waves that are pretty transparent and see it writhing and twirling, diabolically hideous and slimy, flapping amongst bones, or curling round corpses; but above the waterline, I ask, has not everything been proper, agreeable, and decorous, and has any the most squeamish immoralist in Vanity Fair a right to cry fie?</s> <s sid="10" id="vanity.c64.s10">When, however, the Siren disappears and dives below, down among the dead men, the water of course grows turbid over her, and it is labour lost to look into it ever so curiously.</s> <s sid="11" id="vanity.c64.s11">They look pretty enough when they sit upon a rock, twanging their harps and combing their hair, and sing, and beckon to you to come and hold the looking-glass; but when they sink into their native element, depend on it, those mermaids are about no good, and we had best not examine the fiendish marine cannibals, revelling and feasting on their wretched pickled victims.</s> <s sid="12" id="vanity.c64.s12">And so, when Becky is out of the way, be sure that she is not particularly well employed, and that the less that is said about her doings is in fact the better.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vanity.c64.p2"><s sid="13" id="vanity.c64.s13">If we were to give a full account of her proceedings during a couple of years that followed after the Curzon Street catastrophe, there might be some reason for people to say this book was improper.</s> <s sid="14" id="vanity.c64.s14">The actions of very vain, heartless, pleasure-seeking people are very often improper (as are many of yours, my friend with the grave face and spotless reputation--but that is merely by the way); and what are those of a woman without faith--or love--or character?</s> <s sid="15" id="vanity.c64.s15">And I am inclined to think that there was a period in Mrs Becky's life when she was seized, not by remorse, but by a kind of despair, and absolutely neglected her person and did not even care for her reputation.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vanity.c64.p3"><s sid="16" id="vanity.c64.s16">This abattement and degradation did not take place all at once; it was brought about by degrees, after her calamity, and after many struggles to keep up--as a man who goes overboard hangs on to a spar whilst any hope is left, and then flings it away and goes down, when he finds that struggling is in vain.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="vanity.c64.p4"><s sid="17" id="vanity.c64.s17">She lingered about London whilst her husband was making preparations for his departure to his seat of government, and it is believed made more than one attempt to see her brother-in-law, Sir Pitt Crawley, and to work upon his feelings, which she had almost enlisted in her favour.</s> <s sid="18" id="vanity.c64.s18">As Sir Pitt and Mr. Wenham were walking down to the House of Commons, the latter spied Mrs. Rawdon in a black veil, and lurking near the palace of the legislature.</s> <s sid="19" id="vanity.c64.s19">She sneaked away when her eyes met those of Wenham, and indeed never succeeded in her designs upon the Baronet.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="vanity.c64.p6"><s sid="24" id="vanity.c64.s24">The fact was that Pitt's mind had been poisoned against her.</s> <s sid="25" id="vanity.c64.s25">A short time after Lord Steyne's accident Wenham had been with the Baronet and given him such a biography of Mrs. Becky as had astonished the member for Queen's Crawley.</s> <s sid="26" id="vanity.c64.s26">He knew everything regarding her: who her father was; in what year her mother danced at the opera; what had been her previous history; and what her conduct during her married life--as I have no doubt that the greater part of the story was false and dictated by interested malevolence, it shall not be repeated here.</s> <s sid="27" id="vanity.c64.s27">But Becky was left with a sad sad reputation in the esteem of a country gentleman and relative who had been once rather partial to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="vanity.c64.p7"><s sid="28" id="vanity.c64.s28">The revenues of the Governor of Coventry Island are not large.</s> <s sid="29" id="vanity.c64.s29">A part of them were set aside by his Excellency for the payment of certain outstanding debts and liabilities, the charges incident on his high situation required considerable expense; finally, it was found that he could not spare to his wife more than three hundred pounds a year, which he proposed to pay to her on an undertaking that she would never trouble him.</s> <s sid="30" id="vanity.c64.s30">Otherwise, scandal, separation, Doctors' Commons would ensue.</s> <s sid="31" id="vanity.c64.s31">But it was Mr. Wenham's business, Lord Steyne's business, Rawdon's, everybody's--to get her out of the country, and hush up a most disagreeable affair.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="vanity.c64.p8" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="vanity.c64.s32">She was probably so much occupied in arranging these affairs of business with her husband's lawyers that she forgot to take any step whatever about her son, the little Rawdon, and did not even once propose to go and see him.</s> <s sid="33" id="vanity.c64.s33">That young gentleman was consigned to the entire guardianship of his aunt and uncle, the former of whom had always possessed a great share of the child's affection.</s> <s sid="34" id="vanity.c64.s34">His mamma wrote him a neat letter from Boulogne, when she quitted England, in which she requested him to mind his book, and said she was going to take a Continental tour, during which she would have the pleasure of writing to him again.</s> <s sid="35" id="vanity.c64.s35">But she never did for a year afterwards, and not, indeed, until Sir Pitt's only boy, always sickly, died of hooping-cough and measles--then Rawdon's mamma wrote the most affectionate composition to her darling son, who was made heir of Queen's Crawley by this accident, and drawn more closely than ever to the kind lady, whose tender heart had already adopted him.</s> <s sid="36" id="vanity.c64.s36">Rawdon Crawley, then grown a tall, fine lad, blushed when he got the letter.</s> <s sid="37" id="vanity.c64.s37"><qs/>"Oh, Aunt Jane, you are my mother!"<qe/><sss/> he said; <sse/><qs/>"and not--and not that one."<qe/></s> <s sid="38" id="vanity.c64.s38">But he wrote back a kind and respectful letter to Mrs. Rebecca, then living at a boarding-house at Florence.</s> <s sid="39" id="vanity.c64.s39">But we are advancing matters.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="vanity.c64.p10"><s sid="46" id="vanity.c64.s46">Numbers of people were going abroad as usual at the end of the season, and Becky had plenty of opportunities of finding out by the behaviour of her acquaintances of the great London world the opinion of "society" as regarded her conduct.</s> <s sid="47" id="vanity.c64.s47">One day it was Lady Partlet and her daughters whom Becky confronted as she was walking modestly on Boulogne pier, the cliffs of Albion shining in the distance across the deep blue sea.</s> <s sid="48" id="vanity.c64.s48">Lady Partlet marshalled all her daughters round her with a sweep of her parasol and retreated from the pier, darting savage glances at poor little Becky who stood alone there.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="vanity.c67.p1"><s sid="1" id="vanity.c67.s1">Whatever Becky's private plan might be by which Dobbin's true love was to be crowned with success, the little woman thought that the secret might keep, and indeed, being by no means so much interested about anybody's welfare as about her own, she had a great number of things pertaining to herself to consider, and which concerned her a great deal more than Major Dobbin's happiness in this life.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="vanity.c67.p2"><s sid="2" id="vanity.c67.s2">She found herself suddenly and unexpectedly in snug comfortable quarters, surrounded by friends, kindness, and good-natured simple people such as she had not met with for many a long day; and, wanderer as she was by force and inclination, there were moments when rest was pleasant to her.</s> <s sid="3" id="vanity.c67.s3">As the most hardened Arab that ever careered across the desert over the hump of a dromedary likes to repose sometimes under the date-trees by the water, or to come into the cities, walk into the bazaars, refresh himself in the baths, and say his prayers in the mosques, before he goes out again marauding, so Jos's tents and pilau were pleasant to this little Ishmaelite.</s> <s sid="4" id="vanity.c67.s4">She picketed her steed, hung up her weapons, and warmed herself comfortably by his fire.</s> <s sid="5" id="vanity.c67.s5">The halt in that roving, restless life was inexpressibly soothing and pleasant to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="vanity.c67.p3"><s sid="6" id="vanity.c67.s6">So, pleased herself, she tried with all her might to please everybody; and we know that she was eminent and successful as a practitioner in the art of giving pleasure.</s> <s sid="7" id="vanity.c67.s7">As for Jos, even in that little interview in the garret at the Elephant Inn, she had found means to win back a great deal of his good-will.</s> <s sid="8" id="vanity.c67.s8">In the course of a week, the civilian was her sworn slave and frantic admirer.</s> <s sid="9" id="vanity.c67.s9">He didn't go to sleep after dinner, as his custom was in the much less lively society of Amelia.</s> <s sid="10" id="vanity.c67.s10">He drove out with Becky in his open carriage.</s> <s sid="11" id="vanity.c67.s11">He asked little parties and invented festivities to do her honour.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="vanity.c67.p4"><s sid="12" id="vanity.c67.s12">Tapeworm, the Charge d'Affaires, who had abused her so cruelly, came to dine with Jos, and then came every day to pay his respects to Becky.</s> <s sid="13" id="vanity.c67.s13">Poor Emmy, who was never very talkative, and more glum and silent than ever after Dobbin's departure, was quite forgotten when this superior genius made her appearance.</s> <s sid="14" id="vanity.c67.s14">The French Minister was as much charmed with her as his English rival.</s> <s sid="15" id="vanity.c67.s15">The German ladies, never particularly squeamish as regards morals, especially in English people, were delighted with the cleverness and wit of Mrs. Osborne's charming friend, and though she did not ask to go to Court, yet the most august and Transparent Personages there heard of her fascinations and were quite curious to know her.</s> <s sid="16" id="vanity.c67.s16">When it became known that she was noble, of an ancient English family, that her husband was a Colonel of the Guard, Excellenz and Governor of an island, only separated from his lady by one of those trifling differences which are of little account in a country where Werther is still read and the Wahlverwandtschaften of Goethe is considered an edifying moral book, nobody thought of refusing to receive her in the very highest society of the little Duchy; and the ladies were even more ready to call her du and to swear eternal friendship for her than they had been to bestow the same inestimable benefits upon Amelia.</s> <s sid="17" id="vanity.c67.s17">Love and Liberty are interpreted by those simple Germans in a way which honest folks in Yorkshire and Somersetshire little understand, and a lady might, in some philosophic and civilized towns, be divorced ever so many times from her respective husbands and keep her character in society.</s> <s sid="18" id="vanity.c67.s18">Jos's house never was so pleasant since he had a house of his own as Rebecca caused it to be.</s> <s sid="19" id="vanity.c67.s19">She sang, she played, she laughed, she talked in two or three languages, she brought everybody to the house, and she made Jos believe that it was his own great social talents and wit which gathered the society of the place round about him.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="vanity.c67.p5"><s sid="20" id="vanity.c67.s20">As for Emmy, who found herself not in the least mistress of her own house, except when the bills were to be paid, Becky soon discovered the way to soothe and please her.</s> <s sid="21" id="vanity.c67.s21">She talked to her perpetually about Major Dobbin sent about his business, and made no scruple of declaring her admiration for that excellent, high-minded gentleman, and of telling Emmy that she had behaved most cruelly regarding him.</s> <s sid="22" id="vanity.c67.s22">Emmy defended her conduct and showed that it was dictated only by the purest religious principles; that a woman once, &amp;c., and to such an angel as him whom she had had the good fortune to marry, was married forever; but she had no objection to hear the Major praised as much as ever Becky chose to praise him, and indeed, brought the conversation round to the Dobbin subject a score of times every day.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="vanity.c67.p6" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="vanity.c67.s23">Means were easily found to win the favour of Georgy and the servants.</s> <s sid="24" id="vanity.c67.s24">Amelia's maid, it has been said, was heart and soul in favour of the generous Major.</s> <s sid="25" id="vanity.c67.s25">Having at first disliked Becky for being the means of dismissing him from the presence of her mistress, she was reconciled to Mrs. Crawley subsequently, because the latter became William's most ardent admirer and champion.</s> <s sid="26" id="vanity.c67.s26">And in those nightly conclaves in which the two ladies indulged after their parties, and while Miss Payne was <qs/>"brushing their 'airs,"<qe/> as she called the yellow locks of the one and the soft brown tresses of the other, this girl always put in her word for that dear good gentleman Major Dobbin.</s> <s sid="27" id="vanity.c67.s27">Her advocacy did not make Amelia angry any more than Rebecca's admiration of him.</s> <s sid="28" id="vanity.c67.s28">She made George write to him constantly and persisted in sending Mamma's kind love in a postscript.</s> <s sid="29" id="vanity.c67.s29">And as she looked at her husband's portrait of nights, it no longer reproached her--perhaps she reproached it, now William was gone.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="vanity.c67.p7" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="vanity.c67.s30">Emmy was not very happy after her heroic sacrifice.</s> <s sid="31" id="vanity.c67.s31">She was very distraite, nervous, silent, and ill to please.</s> <s sid="32" id="vanity.c67.s32">The family had never known her so peevish.</s> <s sid="33" id="vanity.c67.s33">She grew pale and ill.  She used to try to sing certain songs (<qs/>"Einsam bin ich nicht alleine,"<qe/> was one of them, that tender love-song of Weber's which in old-fashioned days, young ladies, and when you were scarcely born, showed that those who lived before you knew too how to love and to sing) certain songs, I say, to which the Major was partial; and as she warbled them in the twilight in the drawing-room, she would break off in the midst of the song, and walk into her neighbouring apartment, and there, no doubt, take refuge in the miniature of her husband.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="vanity.c67.p8" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="vanity.c67.s34">Some books still subsisted, after Dobbin's departure, with his name written in them; a German dictionary, for instance, with <qs/>"William Dobbin, --th Reg.,"<qe/> in the fly-leaf; a guide-book with his initials; and one or two other volumes which belonged to the Major.</s> <s sid="35" id="vanity.c67.s35">Emmy cleared these away and put them on the drawers, where she placed her work-box, her desk, her Bible, and prayer-book, under the pictures of the two Georges.</s> <s sid="36" id="vanity.c67.s36">And the Major, on going away, having left his gloves behind him, it is a fact that Georgy, rummaging his mother's desk some time afterwards, found the gloves neatly folded up and put away in what they call the secret-drawers of the desk.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="vanity.c67.p9" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="vanity.c67.s37">Not caring for society, and moping there a great deal, Emmy's chief pleasure in the summer evenings was to take long walks with Georgy (during which Rebecca was left to the society of Mr. Joseph), and then the mother and son used to talk about the Major in a way which even made the boy smile.</s> <s sid="38" id="vanity.c67.s38">She told him that she thought Major William was the best man in all the world--the gentlest and the kindest, the bravest and the humblest.</s> <s sid="39" id="vanity.c67.s39">Over and over again she told him how they owed everything which they possessed in the world to that kind friend's benevolent care of them; how he had befriended them all through their poverty and misfortunes; watched over them when nobody cared for them; how all his comrades admired him though he never spoke of his own gallant actions; how Georgy's father trusted him beyond all other men, and had been constantly befriended by the good William.</s> <s sid="40" id="vanity.c67.s40"><qs/>"Why, when your papa was a little boy,"<qe/><sss/> she said, <sse/><qs/>"he often told me that it was William who defended him against a tyrant at the school where they were; and their friendship never ceased from that day until the last, when your dear father fell."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="vanity.c67.p12"><s sid="48" id="vanity.c67.s48">By the way, Mrs. Becky, not to be behind hand in sentiment, had got a miniature too hanging up in her room, to the surprise and amusement of most people, and the delight of the original, who was no other than our friend Jos.</s> <s sid="49" id="vanity.c67.s49">On her first coming to favour the Sedleys with a visit, the little woman, who had arrived with a remarkably small shabby kit, was perhaps ashamed of the meanness of her trunks and bandboxes, and often spoke with great respect about her baggage left behind at Leipzig, which she must have from that city.</s> <s sid="50" id="vanity.c67.s50">When a traveller talks to you perpetually about the splendour of his luggage, which he does not happen to have with him, my son, beware of that traveller!</s> <s sid="51" id="vanity.c67.s51">He is, ten to one, an impostor.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="vanity.c67.p13"><s sid="52" id="vanity.c67.s52">Neither Jos nor Emmy knew this important maxim.</s> <s sid="53" id="vanity.c67.s53">It seemed to them of no consequence whether Becky had a quantity of very fine clothes in invisible trunks; but as her present supply was exceedingly shabby, Emmy supplied her out of her own stores, or took her to the best milliner in the town and there fitted her out.</s> <s sid="54" id="vanity.c67.s54">It was no more torn collars now, I promise you, and faded silks trailing off at the shoulder.</s> <s sid="55" id="vanity.c67.s55">Becky changed her habits with her situation in life--the rouge-pot was suspended--another excitement to which she had accustomed herself was also put aside, or at least only indulged in in privacy, as when she was prevailed on by Jos of a summer evening, Emmy and the boy being absent on their walks, to take a little spirit-and-water.</s> <s sid="56" id="vanity.c67.s56">But if she did not indulge--the courier did: that rascal Kirsch could not be kept from the bottle, nor could he tell how much he took when he applied to it.</s> <s sid="57" id="vanity.c67.s57">He was sometimes surprised himself at the way in which Mr. Sedley's Cognac diminished.</s> <s sid="58" id="vanity.c67.s58">Well, well, this is a painful subject.</s> <s sid="59" id="vanity.c67.s59">Becky did not very likely indulge so much as she used before she entered a decorous family.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="vanity.c67.p14"><s sid="60" id="vanity.c67.s60">At last the much-bragged-about boxes arrived from Leipzig; three of them not by any means large or splendid; nor did Becky appear to take out any sort of dresses or ornaments from the boxes when they did arrive.</s> <s sid="61" id="vanity.c67.s61">But out of one, which contained a mass of her papers (it was that very box which Rawdon Crawley had ransacked in his furious hunt for Becky's concealed money), she took a picture with great glee, which she pinned up in her room, and to which she introduced Jos.</s> <s sid="62" id="vanity.c67.s62">It was the portrait of a gentleman in pencil, his face having the advantage of being painted up in pink.</s> <s sid="63" id="vanity.c67.s63">He was riding on an elephant away from some cocoa-nut trees and a pagoda: it was an Eastern scene.</s> </p>
