<p pid="5" id="basker.c8.p5"><s sid="18" id="basker.c8.s18">One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped convict upon the moor.</s> <s sid="19" id="basker.c8.s19">There is strong reason now to believe that he has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely householders of this district.</s> <s sid="20" id="basker.c8.s20">A fortnight has passed since his flight, during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him.</s> <s sid="21" id="basker.c8.s21">It is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during all that time.</s> <s sid="22" id="basker.c8.s22">Of course, so far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all.</s> <s sid="23" id="basker.c8.s23">Any one of these stone huts would give him a hiding-place.</s> <s sid="24" id="basker.c8.s24">But there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep.</s> <s sid="25" id="basker.c8.s25">We think, therefore, that he has gone, and the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="basker.c8.p6"><s sid="26" id="basker.c8.s26">We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take good care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments when I have thought of the Stapletons.</s> <s sid="27" id="basker.c8.s27">They live miles from any help.</s> <s sid="28" id="basker.c8.s28">There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother, the latter not a very strong man.</s> <s sid="29" id="basker.c8.s29">They would be helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this Notting Hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance.</s> <s sid="30" id="basker.c8.s30">Both Sir Henry and I were concerned at their situation, and it was suggested that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there, but Stapleton would not hear of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="basker.c8.p7"><s sid="31" id="basker.c8.s31">The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a considerable interest in our fair neighbour.</s> <s sid="32" id="basker.c8.s32">It is not to be wondered at, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like him, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman.</s> <s sid="33" id="basker.c8.s33">There is something tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother.</s> <s sid="34" id="basker.c8.s34">Yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires.</s> <s sid="35" id="basker.c8.s35">He has certainly a very marked influence over her, for I have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what she said.</s> <s sid="36" id="basker.c8.s36">I trust that he is kind to her.</s> <s sid="37" id="basker.c8.s37">There is a dry glitter in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips, which goes with a positive and possibly a harsh nature.</s> <s sid="38" id="basker.c8.s38">You would find him an interesting study.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="basker.c8.p8"><s sid="39" id="basker.c8.s39">He came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of the wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin.</s> <s sid="40" id="basker.c8.s40">It was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which is so dismal that it might have suggested the story.</s> <s sid="41" id="basker.c8.s41">We found a short valley between rugged tors which led to an open, grassy space flecked over with the white cotton grass.</s> <s sid="42" id="basker.c8.s42">In the middle of it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at the upper end until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous beast.</s> <s sid="43" id="basker.c8.s43">In every way it corresponded with the scene of the old tragedy.</s> <s sid="44" id="basker.c8.s44">Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men.</s> <s sid="45" id="basker.c8.s45">He spoke lightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest.</s> <s sid="46" id="basker.c8.s46">Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see that he said less than he might, and that he would not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the baronet.</s> <s sid="47" id="basker.c8.s47">He told us of similar cases, where families had suffered from some evil influence, and he left us with the impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="basker.c8.p9"><s sid="48" id="basker.c8.s48">On our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was there that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton.</s> <s sid="49" id="basker.c8.s49">From the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual.</s> <s sid="50" id="basker.c8.s50">He referred to her again and again on our walk home, and since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen something of the brother and sister.</s> <s sid="51" id="basker.c8.s51">They dine here tonight, and there is some talk of our going to them next week.</s> <s sid="52" id="basker.c8.s52">One would imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and yet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest disapprobation in his face when Sir Henry has been paying some attention to his sister.</s> <s sid="53" id="basker.c8.s53">He is much attached to her, no doubt, and would lead a lonely life without her, but it would seem the height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her making so brilliant a marriage.</s> <s sid="54" id="basker.c8.s54">Yet I am certain that he does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have several times observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being tete- a-tete.</s> <s sid="55" id="basker.c8.s55">By the way, your instructions to me never to allow Sir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love affair were to be added to our other difficulties.</s> <s sid="56" id="basker.c8.s56">My popularity would soon suffer if I were to carry out your orders to the letter.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="basker.c9.p2"><s sid="9" id="basker.c9.s9">Before breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went down the corridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had been on the night before.</s> <s sid="10" id="basker.c9.s10">The western window through which he had stared so intently has, I noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows in the house--it commands the nearest outlook on to the moor.</s> <s sid="11" id="basker.c9.s11">There is an opening between two trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down upon it, while from all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be obtained.</s> <s sid="12" id="basker.c9.s12">It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since only this window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for something or somebody upon the moor.</s> <s sid="13" id="basker.c9.s13">The night was very dark, so that I can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone.</s> <s sid="14" id="basker.c9.s14">It had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot.</s> <s sid="15" id="basker.c9.s15">That would have accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness of his wife.</s> <s sid="16" id="basker.c9.s16">The man is a striking-looking fellow, very well equipped to steal the heart of a country girl, so that this theory seemed to have something to support it.</s> <s sid="17" id="basker.c9.s17">That opening of the door which I had heard after I had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep some clandestine appointment.</s> <s sid="18" id="basker.c9.s18">So I reasoned with myself in the morning, and I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however much the result may have shown that they were unfounded.</s> </p>
