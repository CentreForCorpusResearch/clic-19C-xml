<stru>The Picture of Dorian Gray



by



Oscar Wilde</stru>





<stru>THE PREFACE



The artist is the creator of beautiful things.  To reveal art and conceal

the artist is art's aim.  The critic is he who can translate into another

manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.



The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.

Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without

being charming.  This is a fault.



Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated.

For these there is hope.  They are the elect to whom beautiful things

mean only beauty.



There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book.

Books are well written, or badly written.  That is all.



The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban

seeing his own face in a glass.



The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of

Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass.  The moral life of man

forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality

of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium.

No artist desires to prove anything.  Even things that are true

can be proved.  No artist has ethical sympathies.  An ethical

sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style.

No artist is ever morbid.  The artist can express everything.

Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art.

Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art.

From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art

of the musician.  From the point of view of feeling, the actor's

craft is the type.  All art is at once surface and symbol.

Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril.

Those who read the symbol do so at their peril.

It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.

Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work

is new, complex, and vital.  When critics disagree,

the artist is in accord with himself.  We can forgive a man

for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it.

The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one

admires it intensely.



               All art is quite useless.

<title>CHAPTER 1</title>

<p pid="1" id="dorian.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="dorian.c1.s1">The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="dorian.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="dorian.c1.s2">From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion.</s> <s sid="3" id="dorian.c1.s3">The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive.</s> <s sid="4" id="dorian.c1.s4">The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="dorian.c1.p3"><s sid="5" id="dorian.c1.s5">In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="dorian.c1.p4"><s sid="6" id="dorian.c1.s6">As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there.</s> <s sid="7" id="dorian.c1.s7">But he suddenly started up, and closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="dorian.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="dorian.c1.s8"><qs/>"It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,"<qe/> said Lord Henry languidly.</s> <s sid="9" id="dorian.c1.s9"><qs/>"You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor.</s> <s sid="10" id="dorian.c1.s10">The Academy is too large and too vulgar.</s> <s sid="11" id="dorian.c1.s11">Whenever I have gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people, which was worse.</s> <s sid="12" id="dorian.c1.s12">The Grosvenor is really the only place."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="dorian.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="dorian.c1.s13"><qs/>"I don't think I shall send it anywhere,"<qe/> he answered, tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford.</s> <s sid="14" id="dorian.c1.s14"><qs/>"No, I won't send it anywhere."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="dorian.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="dorian.c1.s15">Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette.</s> <s sid="16" id="dorian.c1.s16"><qs/>"Not send it anywhere?</s> <s sid="17" id="dorian.c1.s17">My dear fellow, why?</s> <s sid="18" id="dorian.c1.s18">Have you any reason?</s> <s sid="19" id="dorian.c1.s19">What odd chaps you painters are!</s> <s sid="20" id="dorian.c1.s20">You do anything in the world to gain a reputation.</s> <s sid="21" id="dorian.c1.s21">As soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away.</s> <s sid="22" id="dorian.c1.s22">It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.</s> <s sid="23" id="dorian.c1.s23">A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="dorian.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="dorian.c1.s24"><qs/>"I know you will laugh at me,"<qe/><sss/> he replied, <sse/><qs/>"but I really can't exhibit it.</s> <s sid="25" id="dorian.c1.s25">I have put too much of myself into it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="dorian.c1.p9"><s sid="26" id="dorian.c1.s26">Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="dorian.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="dorian.c1.s43"><qs/>"You don't understand me, Harry,"<qe/> answered the artist.</s> <s sid="44" id="dorian.c1.s44"><qs/>"Of course I am not like him.</s> <s sid="45" id="dorian.c1.s45">I know that perfectly well.</s> <s sid="46" id="dorian.c1.s46">Indeed, I should be sorry to look like him.</s> <s sid="47" id="dorian.c1.s47">You shrug your shoulders?</s> <s sid="48" id="dorian.c1.s48">I am telling you the truth.</s> <s sid="49" id="dorian.c1.s49">There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings.</s> <s sid="50" id="dorian.c1.s50">It is better not to be different from one's fellows.</s> <s sid="51" id="dorian.c1.s51">The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world.</s> <s sid="52" id="dorian.c1.s52">They can sit at their ease and gape at the play.</s> <s sid="53" id="dorian.c1.s53">If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat.</s> <s sid="54" id="dorian.c1.s54">They live as we all should live--undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet.</s> <s sid="55" id="dorian.c1.s55">They neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.</s> <s sid="56" id="dorian.c1.s56">Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are--my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray's good looks--we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="dorian.c11.p2"><s sid="6" id="dorian.c11.s6">In one point he was more fortunate than the novel's fantastic hero.</s> <s sid="7" id="dorian.c11.s7">He never knew--never, indeed, had any cause to know--that somewhat grotesque dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water which came upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was occasioned by the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently, been so remarkable.</s> <s sid="8" id="dorian.c11.s8">It was with an almost cruel joy-- and perhaps in nearly every joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its place--that he used to read the latter part of the book, with its really tragic, if somewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and despair of one who had himself lost what in others, and the world, he had most dearly valued.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="dorian.c11.p3"><s sid="9" id="dorian.c11.s9">For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and many others besides him, seemed never to leave him.</s> <s sid="10" id="dorian.c11.s10">Even those who had heard the most evil things against him-- and from time to time strange rumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the chatter of the clubs-- could not believe anything to his dishonour when they saw him.</s> <s sid="11" id="dorian.c11.s11">He had always the look of one who had kept himself unspotted from the world.</s> <s sid="12" id="dorian.c11.s12">Men who talked grossly became silent when Dorian Gray entered the room.</s> <s sid="13" id="dorian.c11.s13">There was something in the purity of his face that rebuked them.</s> <s sid="14" id="dorian.c11.s14">His mere presence seemed to recall to them the memory of the innocence that they had tarnished.</s> <s sid="15" id="dorian.c11.s15">They wondered how one so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an age that was at once sordid and sensual.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="dorian.c11.p4"><s sid="16" id="dorian.c11.s16">Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging face on the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the polished glass.</s> <s sid="17" id="dorian.c11.s17">The very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure.</s> <s sid="18" id="dorian.c11.s18">He grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul.</s> <s sid="19" id="dorian.c11.s19">He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age.</s> <s sid="20" id="dorian.c11.s20">He would place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture, and smile.</s> <s sid="21" id="dorian.c11.s21">He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="dorian.c11.p5"><s sid="22" id="dorian.c11.s22">There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own delicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little ill-famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in disguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant because it was purely selfish.</s> <s sid="23" id="dorian.c11.s23">But moments such as these were rare.</s> <s sid="24" id="dorian.c11.s24">That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase with gratification.</s> <s sid="25" id="dorian.c11.s25">The more he knew, the more he desired to know.</s> <s sid="26" id="dorian.c11.s26">He had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="dorian.c11.p6" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="dorian.c11.s27">Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to society.</s> <s sid="28" id="dorian.c11.s28">Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art.</s> <s sid="29" id="dorian.c11.s29">His little dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited, as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver.</s> <s sid="30" id="dorian.c11.s30">Indeed, there were many, especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw, in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and perfect manner of a citizen of the world.</s> <s sid="31" id="dorian.c11.s31">To them he seemed to be of the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to <qs/>"make themselves perfect by the worship of beauty."<qe/></s> <s sid="32" id="dorian.c11.s32">Like Gautier, he was one for whom <qs/>"the visible world existed."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="dorian.c11.p7"><s sid="33" id="dorian.c11.s33">And, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation.</s> <s sid="34" id="dorian.c11.s34">Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment universal, and dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for him.</s> <s sid="35" id="dorian.c11.s35">His mode of dressing, and the particular styles that from time to time he affected, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in everything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of his graceful, though to him only half-serious, fopperies.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="dorian.c11.p8"><s sid="36" id="dorian.c11.s36">For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the Satyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be something more than a mere arbiter elegantiarum, to be consulted on the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of a cane.</s> <s sid="37" id="dorian.c11.s37">He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="dorian.c11.p9"><s sid="38" id="dorian.c11.s38">The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence.</s> <s sid="39" id="dorian.c11.s39">But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic.</s> <s sid="40" id="dorian.c11.s40">As he looked back upon man moving through history, he was haunted by a feeling of loss.</s> <s sid="41" id="dorian.c11.s41">So much had been surrendered! and to such little purpose!</s> <s sid="42" id="dorian.c11.s42">There had been mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance, they had sought to escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="dorian.c11.p10"><s sid="43" id="dorian.c11.s43">Yes:  there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism that was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism that is having, in our own day, its curious revival.</s> <s sid="44" id="dorian.c11.s44">It was to have its service of the intellect, certainly, yet it was never to accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience.</s> <s sid="45" id="dorian.c11.s45">Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be.</s> <s sid="46" id="dorian.c11.s46">Of the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls them, it was to know nothing.</s> <s sid="47" id="dorian.c11.s47">But it was to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a moment.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="dorian.c11.p11"><s sid="48" id="dorian.c11.s48">There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie.</s> <s sid="49" id="dorian.c11.s49">Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to tremble.</s> <s sid="50" id="dorian.c11.s50">In black fantastic shapes, dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there.</s> <s sid="51" id="dorian.c11.s51">Outside, there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from her purple cave.</s> <s sid="52" id="dorian.c11.s52">Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern.</s> <s sid="53" id="dorian.c11.s53">The wan mirrors get back their mimic life.</s> <s sid="54" id="dorian.c11.s54">The flameless tapers stand where we had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often.</s> <s sid="55" id="dorian.c11.s55">Nothing seems to us changed.</s> <s sid="56" id="dorian.c11.s56">Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known.</s> <s sid="57" id="dorian.c11.s57">We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="dorian.c11.p12"><s sid="58" id="dorian.c11.s58">It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really alien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and then, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that, indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="dorian.c11.p13" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="dorian.c11.s59">It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman Catholic communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great attraction for him.</s> <s sid="60" id="dorian.c11.s60">The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by its superb rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it sought to symbolize.</s> <s sid="61" id="dorian.c11.s61">He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement and watch the priest, in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft the jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at times, one would fain think, is indeed the <qs/>"panis caelestis,"<qe/> the bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ, breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sins.</s> <s sid="62" id="dorian.c11.s62">The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle fascination for him.</s> <s sid="63" id="dorian.c11.s63">As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating the true story of their lives.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="dorian.c11.p14"><s sid="64" id="dorian.c11.s64">But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which there are no stars and the moon is in travail.</s> <s sid="65" id="dorian.c11.s65">Mysticism, with its marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of the Darwinismus movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions, morbid or healthy, normal or diseased.</s> <s sid="66" id="dorian.c11.s66">Yet, as has been said of him before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance compared with life itself.</s> <s sid="67" id="dorian.c11.s67">He felt keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment.</s> <s sid="68" id="dorian.c11.s68">He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual mysteries to reveal.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="dorian.c11.p15"><s sid="69" id="dorian.c11.s69">And so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their manufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums from the East.</s> <s sid="70" id="dorian.c11.s70">He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one's passions, and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers; of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that sickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to be able to expel melancholy from the soul.</s> </p>
