<title>STORY OF THE DOOR</title>

<p pid="1" id="Jekyll.c1.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="Jekyll.c1.s1">MR.</s> <s sid="2" id="Jekyll.c1.s2">UTTERSON the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance, that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary, and yet somehow lovable.</s> <s sid="3" id="Jekyll.c1.s3">At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life.</s> <s sid="4" id="Jekyll.c1.s4">He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years.</s> <s sid="5" id="Jekyll.c1.s5">But he had an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove.</s> <s sid="6" id="Jekyll.c1.s6"><qs/>"I incline to Cain's heresy,"<qe/> he used to say quaintly:</s> <s sid="7" id="Jekyll.c1.s7"><qs/>"I let my brother go to the devil in his own way."<qe/></s> <s sid="8" id="Jekyll.c1.s8">In this character, it was frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of down-going men.</s> <s sid="9" id="Jekyll.c1.s9">And to such as these, so long as they came about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Jekyll.c1.p2"><s sid="10" id="Jekyll.c1.s10">No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature.</s> <s sid="11" id="Jekyll.c1.s11">It is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was the lawyer's way.</s> <s sid="12" id="Jekyll.c1.s12">His friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object.</s> <s sid="13" id="Jekyll.c1.s13">Hence, no doubt, the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman, the well-known man about town.</s> <s sid="14" id="Jekyll.c1.s14">It was a nut to crack for many, what these two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in common.</s> <s sid="15" id="Jekyll.c1.s15">It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull, and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend.</s> <s sid="16" id="Jekyll.c1.s16">For all that, the two men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them uninterrupted.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Jekyll.c1.p3"><s sid="17" id="Jekyll.c1.s17">It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a by-street in a busy quarter of London.</s> <s sid="18" id="Jekyll.c1.s18">The street was small and what is called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the week-days.</s> <s sid="19" id="Jekyll.c1.s19">The inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed, and all emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus of their gains in coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen.</s> <s sid="20" id="Jekyll.c1.s20">Even on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Jekyll.c1.p4"><s sid="21" id="Jekyll.c1.s21">Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east, the line was broken by the entry of a court; and just at that point, a certain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street.</s> <s sid="22" id="Jekyll.c1.s22">It was two stories high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower story and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore in every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence.</s> <s sid="23" id="Jekyll.c1.s23">The door, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered and distained.</s> <s sid="24" id="Jekyll.c1.s24">Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried his knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Jekyll.c1.p5"><s sid="25" id="Jekyll.c1.s25">Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and pointed.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Jekyll.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="Jekyll.c1.s26"><qs/>"Did you ever remark that door?"<qe/><sls/> he asked; and when his companion had replied in the affirmative, <sle/><qs/>"It is connected in my mind,"<qe/><sss/> added he, <sse/><qs/>"with a very odd story."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Jekyll.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="Jekyll.c1.s27"><qs/>"Indeed?"<qe/><sls/> said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, <sle/><qs/>"and what was that?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Jekyll.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="Jekyll.c1.s28"><qs/>"Well, it was this way,"<qe/> returned Mr. Enfield:</s> <s sid="29" id="Jekyll.c1.s29"><qs/>"I was coming home from some place at the end of the world, about three o'clock of a black winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps.</s> <s sid="30" id="Jekyll.c1.s30">Street after street, and all the folks asleep--street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church--till at last I got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman.</s> <s sid="31" id="Jekyll.c1.s31">All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross street.</s> <s sid="32" id="Jekyll.c1.s32">Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man trampled calmly over the child's body and left her screaming on the ground.</s> <s sid="33" id="Jekyll.c1.s33">It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see.</s> <s sid="34" id="Jekyll.c1.s34">It wasn't like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut.</s> <s sid="35" id="Jekyll.c1.s35">I gave a view-halloa, took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child.</s> <s sid="36" id="Jekyll.c1.s36">He was perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running.</s> <s sid="37" id="Jekyll.c1.s37">The people who had turned out were the girl's own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for whom she had been sent, put in his appearance.</s> <s sid="38" id="Jekyll.c1.s38">Well, the child was not much the worse, more frightened, according to the Sawbones; and there you might have supposed would be an end to it.</s> <s sid="39" id="Jekyll.c1.s39">But there was one curious circumstance.</s> <s sid="40" id="Jekyll.c1.s40">I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight.</s> <s sid="41" id="Jekyll.c1.s41">So had the child's family, which was only natural.</s> <s sid="42" id="Jekyll.c1.s42">But the doctor's case was what struck me.</s> <s sid="43" id="Jekyll.c1.s43">He was the usual cut-and-dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent, and about as emotional as a bagpipe.</s> <s sid="44" id="Jekyll.c1.s44">Well, sir, he was like the rest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that Sawbones turn sick and white with the desire to kill him.</s> <s sid="45" id="Jekyll.c1.s45">I knew what was in his mind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the question, we did the next best.</s> <s sid="46" id="Jekyll.c1.s46">We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this, as should make his name stink from one end of London to the other.</s> <s sid="47" id="Jekyll.c1.s47">If he had any friends or any credit, we undertook that he should lose them.</s> <s sid="48" id="Jekyll.c1.s48">And all the time, as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we could, for they were as wild as harpies.</s> <s sid="49" id="Jekyll.c1.s49">I never saw a circle of such hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of black, sneering coolness--frightened too, I could see that--but carrying it off, sir, really like Satan.</s> <s sid="50" id="Jekyll.c1.s50"><alt-qs/>'If you choose to make capital out of this accident,'<alt-qe/><sss/> said he, <sse/><alt-qs/>'I am naturally helpless.</s> <s sid="51" id="Jekyll.c1.s51">No gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene,'<alt-qe/> says he.</s> <s sid="52" id="Jekyll.c1.s52"><alt-qs/>'Name your figure.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="53" id="Jekyll.c1.s53">Well, we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the child's family; he would have clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us that meant mischief, and at last he struck.</s> <s sid="54" id="Jekyll.c1.s54">The next thing was to get the money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with the door?-- whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts's, drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can't mention, though it's one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least very well known and often printed.</s> <s sid="55" id="Jekyll.c1.s55">The figure was stiff; but the signature was good for more than that, if it was only genuine.</s> <s sid="56" id="Jekyll.c1.s56">I took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out of it with another man's cheque for close upon a hundred pounds.</s> <s sid="57" id="Jekyll.c1.s57">But he was quite easy and sneering.</s> <s sid="58" id="Jekyll.c1.s58"><alt-qs/>'Set your mind at rest,'<alt-qe/><sss/> says he, <sse/><alt-qs/>'I will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="59" id="Jekyll.c1.s59">So we all set off, the doctor, and the child's father, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank.</s> <s sid="60" id="Jekyll.c1.s60">I gave in the check myself, and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery.</s> <s sid="61" id="Jekyll.c1.s61">Not a bit of it.</s> <s sid="62" id="Jekyll.c1.s62">The cheque was genuine."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Jekyll.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="Jekyll.c1.s63"><qs/>"Tut-tut,"<qe/> said Mr. Utterson.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Jekyll.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="Jekyll.c1.s64"><qs/>"I see you feel as I do,"<qe/> said Mr. Enfield.</s> <s sid="65" id="Jekyll.c1.s65"><qs/>"Yes, it's a bad story.</s> <s sid="66" id="Jekyll.c1.s66">For my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your fellows who do what they call good.</s> <s sid="67" id="Jekyll.c1.s67">Black-mail, I suppose; an honest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth.</s> <s sid="68" id="Jekyll.c1.s68">Black-Mail House is what I call that place with the door, in consequence.</s> <s sid="69" id="Jekyll.c1.s69">Though even that, you know, is far from explaining all,"<qe/> he added, and with the words fell into a vein of musing.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Jekyll.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="Jekyll.c1.s70">From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly:</s> <s sid="71" id="Jekyll.c1.s71"><qs/>"And you don't know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Jekyll.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="Jekyll.c1.s72"><qs/>"A likely place, isn't it?"<qe/> returned Mr. Enfield.</s> <s sid="73" id="Jekyll.c1.s73"><qs/>"But I happen to have noticed his address; he lives in some square or other."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="Jekyll.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="Jekyll.c1.s74"><qs/>"And you never asked about the--place with the door?"<qe/> said Mr. Utterson.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Jekyll.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="Jekyll.c1.s75"><qs/>"No, sir:</s> <s sid="76" id="Jekyll.c1.s76">I had a delicacy,"<qe/> was the reply.</s> <s sid="77" id="Jekyll.c1.s77"><qs/>"I feel very strongly about putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment.</s> <s sid="78" id="Jekyll.c1.s78">You start a question, and it's like starting a stone.</s> <s sid="79" id="Jekyll.c1.s79">You sit quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others; and presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of) is knocked on the head in his own back-garden and the family have to change their name.</s> <s sid="80" id="Jekyll.c1.s80">No, sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks like Queer Street, the less I ask."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Jekyll.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="Jekyll.c1.s81"><qs/>"A very good rule, too,"<qe/> said the lawyer.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Jekyll.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="Jekyll.c1.s82"><qs/>"But I have studied the place for myself,"<qe/> continued Mr. Enfield.</s> <s sid="83" id="Jekyll.c1.s83"><qs/>"It seems scarcely a house.</s> <s sid="84" id="Jekyll.c1.s84">There is no other door, and nobody goes in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my adventure.</s> <s sid="85" id="Jekyll.c1.s85">There are three windows looking on the court on the first floor; none below; the windows are always shut but they're clean.</s> <s sid="86" id="Jekyll.c1.s86">And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must live there.</s> <s sid="87" id="Jekyll.c1.s87">And yet it's not so sure; for the buildings are so packed together about that court, that it's hard to say where one ends and another begins."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Jekyll.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="Jekyll.c1.s88">The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then, <qs/>"Enfield,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Utterson, <sse/><qs/>"that's a good rule of yours."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="Jekyll.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="Jekyll.c1.s89"><qs/>"Yes, I think it is,"<qe/> returned Enfield.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="Jekyll.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="Jekyll.c1.s90"><qs/>"But for all that,"<qe/><sss/> continued the lawyer, <sse/><qs/>"there's one point I want to ask:</s> <s sid="91" id="Jekyll.c1.s91">I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="Jekyll.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="Jekyll.c1.s92"><qs/>"Well,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Enfield, <sse/><qs/>"I can't see what harm it would do.</s> <s sid="93" id="Jekyll.c1.s93">It was a man of the name of Hyde."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="Jekyll.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="Jekyll.c1.s94"><qs/>"H'm,"<qe/> said Mr. Utterson.</s> <s sid="95" id="Jekyll.c1.s95"><qs/>"What sort of a man is he to see?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="Jekyll.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="96" id="Jekyll.c1.s96"><qs/>"He is not easy to describe.</s> <s sid="97" id="Jekyll.c1.s97">There is something wrong with his appearance; something displeasing, something downright detestable.</s> <s sid="98" id="Jekyll.c1.s98">I never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why.</s> <s sid="99" id="Jekyll.c1.s99">He must be deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I couldn't specify the point.</s> <s sid="100" id="Jekyll.c1.s100">He's an extraordinary-looking man, and yet I really can name nothing out of the way.</s> <s sid="101" id="Jekyll.c1.s101">No, sir; I can make no hand of it; I can't describe him.</s> <s sid="102" id="Jekyll.c1.s102">And it's not want of memory; for I declare I can see him this moment."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="Jekyll.c1.p23"><s sid="103" id="Jekyll.c1.s103">Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight of consideration.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="Jekyll.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="Jekyll.c1.s104"><qs/>"You are sure he used a key?"<qe/> he inquired at last.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="Jekyll.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="105" id="Jekyll.c1.s105"><qs/>"My dear sir..."<qe/> began Enfield, surprised out of himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Jekyll.c4.p2"><s sid="16" id="Jekyll.c4.s16">It was two o'clock when she came to herself and called for the police.</s> <s sid="17" id="Jekyll.c4.s17">The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle of the lane, incredibly mangled.</s> <s sid="18" id="Jekyll.c4.s18">The stick with which the deed had been done, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter--the other, without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer.</s> <s sid="19" id="Jekyll.c4.s19">A purse and a gold watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a sealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the post, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Jekyll.c4.p3" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="Jekyll.c4.s20">This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of bed; and he had no sooner seen it, and been told the circumstances, than he shot out a solemn lip.</s> <s sid="21" id="Jekyll.c4.s21"><qs/>"I shall say nothing till I have seen the body,"<qe/><sss/> said he; <sse/><qs/>"this may be very serious.</s> <s sid="22" id="Jekyll.c4.s22">Have the kindness to wait while I dress."<qe/></s> <s sid="23" id="Jekyll.c4.s23">And with the same grave countenance he hurried through his breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had been carried.</s> <s sid="24" id="Jekyll.c4.s24">As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Jekyll.c4.p4" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="Jekyll.c4.s25"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/><sss/> said he, <sse/><qs/>"I recognise him.</s> <s sid="26" id="Jekyll.c4.s26">I am sorry to say that this is Sir Danvers Carew."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Jekyll.c4.p6"><s sid="32" id="Jekyll.c4.s32">Mr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the stick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and battered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself presented many years before to Henry Jekyll.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Jekyll.c4.p7" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="Jekyll.c4.s33"><qs/>"Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?"<qe/> he inquired.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Jekyll.c4.p9" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="Jekyll.c4.s35">Mr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, <qs/>"If you will come with me in my cab,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"I think I can take you to his house."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Jekyll.c4.p10"><s sid="36" id="Jekyll.c4.s36">It was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the season.</s> <s sid="37" id="Jekyll.c4.s37">A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so that as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a marvellous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be dark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich, lurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here, for a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths.</s> <s sid="38" id="Jekyll.c4.s38">The dismal quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy ways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful re-invasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer's eyes, like a district of some city in a nightmare.</s> <s sid="39" id="Jekyll.c4.s39">The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of the gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive, he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law's officers, which may at times assail the most honest.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Jekyll.c4.p11"><s sid="40" id="Jekyll.c4.s40">As the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a little and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating-house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning glass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part, as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings.</s> <s sid="41" id="Jekyll.c4.s41">This was the home of Henry Jekyll's favourite; of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Jekyll.c4.p12"><s sid="42" id="Jekyll.c4.s42">An ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door.</s> <s sid="43" id="Jekyll.c4.s43">She had an evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy; but her manners were excellent.</s> <s sid="44" id="Jekyll.c4.s44">Yes, she said, this was Mr. Hyde's, but he was not at home; he had been in that night very late, but had gone away again in less than an hour; there was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and he was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she had seen him till yesterday.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="Jekyll.c4.p13" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="Jekyll.c4.s45"><qs/>"Very well, then, we wish to see his rooms,"<qe/><sls/> said the lawyer; and when the woman began to declare it was impossible, <sle/><qs/>"I had better tell you who this person is,"<qe/> he added.</s> <s sid="46" id="Jekyll.c4.s46"><qs/>"This is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland Yard."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Jekyll.c4.p14" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="Jekyll.c4.s47">A flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman's face.</s> <s sid="48" id="Jekyll.c4.s48"><qs/>"Ah!"<qe/><sss/> said she, <sse/><qs/>"he is in trouble!</s> <s sid="49" id="Jekyll.c4.s49">What has he done?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Jekyll.c4.p15" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="Jekyll.c4.s50">Mr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances.</s> <s sid="51" id="Jekyll.c4.s51"><qs/>"He don't seem a very popular character,"<qe/> observed the latter.</s> <s sid="52" id="Jekyll.c4.s52"><qs/>"And now, my good woman, just let me and this gentleman have a look about us."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Jekyll.c4.p16"><s sid="53" id="Jekyll.c4.s53">In the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained otherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but these were furnished with luxury and good taste.</s> <s sid="54" id="Jekyll.c4.s54">A closet was filled with wine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung upon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who was much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and agreeable in colour.</s> <s sid="55" id="Jekyll.c4.s55">At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the floor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had been burned.</s> <s sid="56" id="Jekyll.c4.s56">From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt-end of a green cheque-book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the other half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched his suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted.</s> <s sid="57" id="Jekyll.c4.s57">A visit to the bank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderer's credit, completed his gratification.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Jekyll.c4.p17" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="Jekyll.c4.s58"><qs/>"You may depend upon it, sir,"<qe/> he told Mr. Utterson:</s> <s sid="59" id="Jekyll.c4.s59"><qs/>"I have him in my hand.</s> <s sid="60" id="Jekyll.c4.s60">He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick or, above all, burned the cheque-book.</s> <s sid="61" id="Jekyll.c4.s61">Why, money's life to the man.</s> <s sid="62" id="Jekyll.c4.s62">We have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the handbills."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="Jekyll.c4.p18"><s sid="63" id="Jekyll.c4.s63">This last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde had numbered few familiars--even the master of the servant-maid had only seen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been photographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as common observers will.</s> <s sid="64" id="Jekyll.c4.s64">Only on one point, were they agreed; and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive impressed his beholders.</s> </p></div>

<title>HENRY JEKYLL'S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE</title>
