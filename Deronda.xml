<stru>Let thy chief terror be of thine own soul:

There, 'mid the throng of hurrying desires

That trample on the dead to seize their spoil,

Lurks vengeance, footless, irresistible

As exhalations laden with slow death,

And o'er the fairest troop of captured joys

Breathes pallid pestilence.</stru>

<title>CHAPTER I.</title>

<p pid="1" id="Deronda.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="Deronda.c1.s1">Men can do nothing without the make-believe of a beginning.</s> <s sid="2" id="Deronda.c1.s2">Even science, the strict measurer, is obliged to start with a make-believe unit, and must fix on a point in the stars' unceasing journey when his sidereal clock shall pretend that time is at Nought.</s> <s sid="3" id="Deronda.c1.s3">His less accurate grandmother Poetry has always been understood to start in the middle; but on reflection it appears that her proceeding is not very different from his; since Science, too, reckons backward as well as forward, divides his unit into billions, and with his clock-finger at Nought really sets off _in medias res_.</s> <s sid="4" id="Deronda.c1.s4">No retrospect will take us to the true beginning; and whether our prologue be in heaven or on earth, it is but a fraction of that all-presupposing fact with which our story sets out.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Deronda.c1.p2"><s sid="5" id="Deronda.c1.s5">Was she beautiful or not beautiful? and what was the secret of form or expression which gave the dynamic quality to her glance?</s> <s sid="6" id="Deronda.c1.s6">Was the good or the evil genius dominant in those beams?</s> <s sid="7" id="Deronda.c1.s7">Probably the evil; else why was the effect that of unrest rather than of undisturbed charm?</s> <s sid="8" id="Deronda.c1.s8">Why was the wish to look again felt as coercion and not as a longing in which the whole being consents?</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Deronda.c1.p3"><s sid="9" id="Deronda.c1.s9">She who raised these questions in Daniel Deronda's mind was occupied in gambling: not in the open air under a southern sky, tossing coppers on a ruined wall, with rags about her limbs; but in one of those splendid resorts which the enlightenment of ages has prepared for the same species of pleasure at a heavy cost of guilt mouldings, dark-toned color and chubby nudities, all correspondingly heavy--forming a suitable condenser for human breath belonging, in great part, to the highest fashion, and not easily procurable to be breathed in elsewhere in the like proportion, at least by persons of little fashion.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Deronda.c1.p4"><s sid="10" id="Deronda.c1.s10">It was near four o'clock on a September day, so that the atmosphere was well-brewed to a visible haze.</s> <s sid="11" id="Deronda.c1.s11">There was deep stillness, broken only by a light rattle, a light chink, a small sweeping sound, and an occasional monotone in French, such as might be expected to issue from an ingeniously constructed automaton.</s> <s sid="12" id="Deronda.c1.s12">Round two long tables were gathered two serried crowds of human beings, all save one having their faces and attention bent on the tables.</s> <s sid="13" id="Deronda.c1.s13">The one exception was a melancholy little boy, with his knees and calves simply in their natural clothing of epidermis, but for the rest of his person in a fancy dress.</s> <s sid="14" id="Deronda.c1.s14">He alone had his face turned toward the doorway, and fixing on it the blank gaze of a bedizened child stationed as a masquerading advertisement on the platform of an itinerant show, stood close behind a lady deeply engaged at the roulette-table.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Deronda.c1.p5"><s sid="15" id="Deronda.c1.s15">About this table fifty or sixty persons were assembled, many in the outer rows, where there was occasionally a deposit of new-comers, being mere spectators, only that one of them, usually a woman, might now and then be observed putting down a five-franc with a simpering air, just to see what the passion of gambling really was.</s> <s sid="16" id="Deronda.c1.s16">Those who were taking their pleasure at a higher strength, and were absorbed in play, showed very distant varieties of European type:</s> <s sid="17" id="Deronda.c1.s17">Livonian and Spanish, Graeco-Italian and miscellaneous German, English aristocratic and English plebeian.</s> <s sid="18" id="Deronda.c1.s18">Here certainly was a striking admission of human equality.</s> <s sid="19" id="Deronda.c1.s19">The white bejewelled fingers of an English countess were very near touching a bony, yellow, crab-like hand stretching a bared wrist to clutch a heap of coin--a hand easy to sort with the square, gaunt face, deep-set eyes, grizzled eyebrows, and ill-combed scanty hair which seemed a slight metamorphosis of the vulture.</s> <s sid="20" id="Deronda.c1.s20">And where else would her ladyship have graciously consented to sit by that dry-lipped feminine figure prematurely old, withered after short bloom like her artificial flowers, holding a shabby velvet reticule before her, and occasionally putting in her mouth the point with which she pricked her card?</s> <s sid="21" id="Deronda.c1.s21">There too, very near the fair countess, was a respectable London tradesman, blonde and soft-handed, his sleek hair scrupulously parted behind and before, conscious of circulars addressed to the nobility and gentry, whose distinguished patronage enabled him to take his holidays fashionably, and to a certain extent in their distinguished company.</s> <s sid="22" id="Deronda.c1.s22">Not his gambler's passion that nullifies appetite, but a well-fed leisure, which, in the intervals of winning money in business and spending it showily, sees no better resource than winning money in play and spending it yet more showily--reflecting always that Providence had never manifested any disapprobation of his amusement, and dispassionate enough to leave off if the sweetness of winning much and seeing others lose had turned to the sourness of losing much and seeing others win.</s> <s sid="23" id="Deronda.c1.s23">For the vice of gambling lay in losing money at it.</s> <s sid="24" id="Deronda.c1.s24">In his bearing there might be something of the tradesman, but in his pleasures he was fit to rank with the owners of the oldest titles.</s> <s sid="25" id="Deronda.c1.s25">Standing close to his chair was a handsome Italian, calm, statuesque, reaching across him to place the first pile of napoleons from a new bagful just brought him by an envoy with a scrolled mustache.</s> <s sid="26" id="Deronda.c1.s26">The pile was in half a minute pushed over to an old bewigged woman with eye-glasses pinching her nose.</s> <s sid="27" id="Deronda.c1.s27">There was a slight gleam, a faint mumbling smile about the lips of the old woman; but the statuesque Italian remained impassive, and--probably secure in an infallible system which placed his foot on the neck of chance--immediately prepared a new pile.</s> <s sid="28" id="Deronda.c1.s28">So did a man with the air of an emaciated beau or worn-out libertine, who looked at life through one eye-glass, and held out his hand tremulously when he asked for change.</s> <s sid="29" id="Deronda.c1.s29">It could surely be no severity of system, but rather some dream of white crows, or the induction that the eighth of the month was lucky, which inspired the fierce yet tottering impulsiveness of his play.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Deronda.c1.p6"><s sid="30" id="Deronda.c1.s30">But, while every single player differed markedly from every other, there was a certain uniform negativeness of expression which had the effect of a mask--as if they had all eaten of some root that for the time compelled the brains of each to the same narrow monotony of action.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Deronda.c1.p7"><s sid="31" id="Deronda.c1.s31">Deronda's first thought when his eyes fell on this scene of dull, gas- poisoned absorption, was that the gambling of Spanish shepherd-boys had seemed to him more enviable:--so far Rousseau might be justified in maintaining that art and science had done a poor service to mankind.</s> <s sid="32" id="Deronda.c1.s32">But suddenly he felt the moment become dramatic.</s> <s sid="33" id="Deronda.c1.s33">His attention was arrested by a young lady who, standing at an angle not far from him, was the last to whom his eyes traveled.</s> <s sid="34" id="Deronda.c1.s34">She was bending and speaking English to a middle- aged lady seated at play beside her: but the next instant she returned to her play, and showed the full height of a graceful figure, with a face which might possibly be looked at without admiration, but could hardly be passed with indifference.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Deronda.c1.p8"><s sid="35" id="Deronda.c1.s35">The inward debate which she raised in Deronda gave to his eyes a growing expression of scrutiny, tending farther and farther away from the glow of mingled undefined sensibilities forming admiration.</s> <s sid="36" id="Deronda.c1.s36">At one moment they followed the movements of the figure, of the arms and hands, as this problematic sylph bent forward to deposit her stake with an air of firm choice; and the next they returned to the face which, at present unaffected by beholders, was directed steadily toward the game.</s> <s sid="37" id="Deronda.c1.s37">The sylph was a winner; and as her taper fingers, delicately gloved in pale-gray, were adjusting the coins which had been pushed toward her in order to pass them back again to the winning point, she looked round her with a survey too markedly cold and neutral not to have in it a little of that nature which we call art concealing an inward exultation.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Deronda.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="Deronda.c1.s38">But in the course of that survey her eyes met Deronda's, and instead of averting them as she would have desired to do, she was unpleasantly conscious that they were arrested--how long?</s> <s sid="39" id="Deronda.c1.s39">The darting sense that he was measuring her and looking down on her as an inferior, that he was of different quality from the human dross around her, that he felt himself in a region outside and above her, and was examining her as a specimen of a lower order, roused a tingling resentment which stretched the moment with conflict.</s> <s sid="40" id="Deronda.c1.s40">It did not bring the blood to her cheeks, but it sent it away from her lips.</s> <s sid="41" id="Deronda.c1.s41">She controlled herself by the help of an inward defiance, and without other sign of emotion than this lip-paleness turned to her play.</s> <s sid="42" id="Deronda.c1.s42">But Deronda's gaze seemed to have acted as an evil eye.</s> <s sid="43" id="Deronda.c1.s43">Her stake was gone.</s> <s sid="44" id="Deronda.c1.s44">No matter; she had been winning ever since she took to roulette with a few napoleons at command, and had a considerable reserve.</s> <s sid="45" id="Deronda.c1.s45">She had begun to believe in her luck, others had begun to believe in it: she had visions of being followed by a _cortege_ who would worship her as a goddess of luck and watch her play as a directing augury.</s> <s sid="46" id="Deronda.c1.s46">Such things had been known of male gamblers; why should not a woman have a like supremacy?</s> <s sid="47" id="Deronda.c1.s47">Her friend and chaperon who had not wished her to play at first was beginning to approve, only administering the prudent advice to stop at the right moment and carry money back to England--advice to which Gwendolen had replied that she cared for the excitement of play, not the winnings.</s> <s sid="48" id="Deronda.c1.s48">On that supposition the present moment ought to have made the flood-tide in her eager experience of gambling.</s> <s sid="49" id="Deronda.c1.s49">Yet, when her next stake was swept away, she felt the orbits of her eyes getting hot, and the certainty she had (without looking) of that man still watching her was something like a pressure which begins to be torturing.</s> <s sid="50" id="Deronda.c1.s50">The more reason to her why she should not flinch, but go on playing as if she were indifferent to loss or gain.</s> <s sid="51" id="Deronda.c1.s51">Her friend touched her elbow and proposed that they should quit the table.</s> <s sid="52" id="Deronda.c1.s52">For reply Gwendolen put ten louis on the same spot: she was in that mood of defiance in which the mind loses sight of any end beyond the satisfaction of enraged resistance; and with the puerile stupidity of a dominant impulse includes luck among its objects of defiance.</s> <s sid="53" id="Deronda.c1.s53">Since she was not winning strikingly, the next best thing was to lose strikingly.</s> <s sid="54" id="Deronda.c1.s54">She controlled her muscles, and showed no tremor of mouth or hands.</s> <s sid="55" id="Deronda.c1.s55">Each time her stake was swept off she doubled it.</s> <s sid="56" id="Deronda.c1.s56">Many were now watching her, but the sole observation she was conscious of was Deronda's, who, though she never looked toward him, she was sure had not moved away.</s> <s sid="57" id="Deronda.c1.s57">Such a drama takes no long while to play out: development and catastrophe can often be measured by nothing clumsier than the moment-hand.</s> <s sid="58" id="Deronda.c1.s58"><qs/>"Faites votre jeu, mesdames et messieurs,"<qe/> said the automatic voice of destiny from between the mustache and imperial of the croupier: and Gwendolen's arm was stretched to deposit her last poor heap of napoleons.</s> <s sid="59" id="Deronda.c1.s59"><qs/>"Le jeu ne va plus,"<qe/> said destiny.</s> <s sid="60" id="Deronda.c1.s60">And in five seconds Gwendolen turned from the table, but turned resolutely with her face toward Deronda and looked at him.</s> <s sid="61" id="Deronda.c1.s61">There was a smile of irony in his eyes as their glances met; but it was at least better that he should have disregarded her as one of an insect swarm who had no individual physiognomy.</s> <s sid="62" id="Deronda.c1.s62">Besides, in spite of his superciliousness and irony, it was difficult to believe that he did not admire her spirit as well as her person: he was young, handsome, distinguished in appearance--not one of these ridiculous and dowdy Philistines who thought it incumbent on them to blight the gaming-table with a sour look of protest as they passed by it.</s> <s sid="63" id="Deronda.c1.s63">The general conviction that we are admirable does not easily give way before a single negative; rather when any of Vanity's large family, male or female, find their performance received coldly, they are apt to believe that a little more of it will win over the unaccountable dissident.</s> <s sid="64" id="Deronda.c1.s64">In Gwendolen's habits of mind it had been taken for granted that she knew what was admirable and that she herself was admired.</s> <s sid="65" id="Deronda.c1.s65">This basis of her thinking had received a disagreeable concussion, and reeled a little, but was not easily to be overthrown.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Deronda.c1.p10"><s sid="66" id="Deronda.c1.s66">In the evening the same room was more stiflingly heated, was brilliant with gas and with the costumes of ladies who floated their trains along it or were seated on the ottomans.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Deronda.c1.p11"><s sid="67" id="Deronda.c1.s67">The Nereid in sea-green robes and silver ornaments, with a pale sea-green feather fastened in silver falling backward over her green hat and light brown hair, was Gwendolen Harleth.</s> <s sid="68" id="Deronda.c1.s68">She was under the wing, or rather soared by the shoulder, of the lady who had sat by her at the roulette- table; and with them was a gentleman with a white mustache and clipped hair: solid-browed, stiff and German.</s> <s sid="69" id="Deronda.c1.s69">They were walking about or standing to chat with acquaintances, and Gwendolen was much observed by the seated groups.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="Deronda.c3.p55" type="speech"><s sid="145" id="Deronda.c3.s145">One of his advantages was a fine person, which perhaps was even more impressive at fifty-seven than it had been earlier in life.</s> <s sid="146" id="Deronda.c3.s146">There were no distinctively clerical lines in the face, no tricks of starchiness or of affected ease: in his Inverness cape he could not have been identified except as a gentleman with handsome dark features, a nose which began with an intention to be aquiline but suddenly became straight, and iron-gray, hair.</s> <s sid="147" id="Deronda.c3.s147">Perhaps he owed this freedom from the sort of professional make-up which penetrates skin, tones and gestures and defies all drapery, to the fact that he had once been Captain Gaskin, having taken orders and a diphthong but shortly before his engagement to Miss Armyn.</s> <s sid="148" id="Deronda.c3.s148">If any one had objected that his preparation for the clerical function was inadequate, his friends might have asked who made a better figure in it, who preached better or had more authority in his parish?</s> <s sid="149" id="Deronda.c3.s149">He had a native gift for administration, being tolerant both of opinions and conduct, because he felt himself able to overrule them, and was free from the irritations of conscious feebleness.</s> <s sid="150" id="Deronda.c3.s150">He smiled pleasantly at the foible of a taste which he did not share--at floriculture or antiquarianism for example, which were much in vogue among his fellow-clergyman in the diocese: for himself, he preferred following the history of a campaign, or divining from his knowledge of Nesselrode's motives what would have been his conduct if our cabinet had taken a different course.</s> <s sid="151" id="Deronda.c3.s151">Mr. Gascoigne's tone of thinking after some long-quieted fluctuations had become ecclesiastical rather than theological; not the modern Anglican, but what he would have called sound English, free from nonsense; such as became a man who looked at a national religion by daylight, and saw it in its relation to other things.</s> <s sid="152" id="Deronda.c3.s152">No clerical magistrate had greater weight at sessions, or less of mischievous impracticableness in relation to worldly affairs.</s> <s sid="153" id="Deronda.c3.s153">Indeed, the worst imputation thrown out against him was worldliness: it could not be proved that he forsook the less fortunate, but it was not to be denied that the friendships he cultivated were of a kind likely to be useful to the father of six sons and two daughters; and bitter observers--for in Wessex, say ten years ago, there were persons whose bitterness may now seem incredible--remarked that the color of his opinions had changed in consistency with this principle of action.</s> <s sid="154" id="Deronda.c3.s154">But cheerful, successful worldliness has a false air of being more selfish than the acrid, unsuccessful kind, whose secret history is summed up in the terrible words, <qs/>"Sold, but not paid for."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Deronda.c4.p6"><s sid="32" id="Deronda.c4.s32">There were many subjects in the world--perhaps the majority--in which she felt no interest, because they were stupid; for subjects are apt to appear stupid to the young as light seems dull to the old; but she would not have felt at all helpless in relation to them if they had turned up in conversation.</s> <s sid="33" id="Deronda.c4.s33">It must be remembered that no one had disputed her power or her general superiority.</s> <s sid="34" id="Deronda.c4.s34">As on the arrival at Offendene, so always, the first thought of those about her had been, what will Gwendolen think?--if the footman trod heavily in creaking boots, or if the laundress's work was unsatisfactory, the maid said, "This will never do for Miss Harleth"; if the wood smoked in the bedroom fireplace, Mrs. Davilow, whose own weak eyes suffered much from this inconvenience, spoke apologetically of it to Gwendolen.</s> <s sid="35" id="Deronda.c4.s35">If, when they were under the stress of traveling, she did not appear at the breakfast table till every one else had finished, the only question was, how Gwendolen's coffee and toast should still be of the hottest and crispest; and when she appeared with her freshly-brushed light-brown hair streaming backward and awaiting her mamma's hand to coil it up, her large brown eyes glancing bright as a wave-washed onyx from under their long lashes, it was always she herself who had to be tolerant --to beg that Alice who sat waiting on her would not stick up her shoulders in that frightful manner, and that Isabel, instead of pushing up to her and asking questions, would go away to Miss Merry.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Deronda.c4.p7"><s sid="36" id="Deronda.c4.s36">Always she was the princess in exile, who in time of famine was to have her breakfast-roll made of the finest-bolted flour from the seven thin ears of wheat, and in a general decampment was to have her silver folk kept out of the baggage.</s> <s sid="37" id="Deronda.c4.s37">How was this to be accounted for?</s> <s sid="38" id="Deronda.c4.s38">The answer may seem to lie quite on the surface:--in her beauty, a certain unusualness about her, a decision of will which made itself felt in her graceful movements and clear unhesitating tones, so that if she came into the room on a rainy day when everybody else was flaccid and the use of things in general was not apparent to them, there seemed to be a sudden, sufficient reason for keeping up the forms of life; and even the waiters at hotels showed the more alacrity in doing away with crumbs and creases and dregs with struggling flies in them.</s> <s sid="39" id="Deronda.c4.s39">This potent charm, added to the fact that she was the eldest daughter, toward whom her mamma had always been in an apologetic state of mind for the evils brought on her by a step-father, may seem so full a reason for Gwendolen's domestic empire, that to look for any other would be to ask the reason of daylight when the sun is shining.</s> <s sid="40" id="Deronda.c4.s40">But beware of arriving at conclusions without comparison.</s> <s sid="41" id="Deronda.c4.s41">I remember having seen the same assiduous, apologetic attention awarded to persons who were not at all beautiful or unusual, whose firmness showed itself in no very graceful or euphonious way, and who were not eldest daughters with a tender, timid mother, compunctious at having subjected them to inconveniences.</s> <s sid="42" id="Deronda.c4.s42">Some of them were a very common sort of men.</s> <s sid="43" id="Deronda.c4.s43">And the only point of resemblance among them all was a strong determination to have what was pleasant, with a total fearlessness in making themselves disagreeable or dangerous when they did not get it.</s> <s sid="44" id="Deronda.c4.s44">Who is so much cajoled and served with trembling by the weak females of a household as the unscrupulous male--capable, if he has not free way at home, of going and doing worse elsewhere?</s> <s sid="45" id="Deronda.c4.s45">Hence I am forced to doubt whether even without her potent charm and peculiar filial position Gwendolen might not still have played the queen in exile, if only she had kept her inborn energy of egoistic desire, and her power of inspiring fear as to what she might say or do.</s> <s sid="46" id="Deronda.c4.s46">However, she had the charm, and those who feared her were also fond of her; the fear and the fondness being perhaps both heightened by what may be called the iridescence of her character--the play of various, nay, contrary tendencies.</s> <s sid="47" id="Deronda.c4.s47">For Macbeth's rhetoric about the impossibility of being many opposite things in the same moment, referred to the clumsy necessities of action and not to the subtler possibilities of feeling.</s> <s sid="48" id="Deronda.c4.s48">We cannot speak a loyal word and be meanly silent; we cannot kill and not kill in the same moment; but a moment is wide enough for the loyal and mean desire, for the outlash of a murderous thought and the sharp backward stroke of repentance.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="2" id="Deronda.c5.p2"><s sid="4" id="Deronda.c5.s4">Among the houses where Gwendolen was not quite liked, and yet invited, was Quetcham Hall.</s> <s sid="5" id="Deronda.c5.s5">One of her first invitations was to a large dinner-party there, which made a sort of general introduction for her to the society of the neighborhood; for in a select party of thirty and of well-composed proportions as to age, few visitable families could be entirely left out.</s> <s sid="6" id="Deronda.c5.s6">No youthful figure there was comparable to Gwendolen's as she passed through the long suite of rooms adorned with light and flowers, and, visible at first as a slim figure floating along in white drapery, approached through one wide doorway after another into fuller illumination and definiteness.</s> <s sid="7" id="Deronda.c5.s7">She had never had that sort of promenade before, and she felt exultingly that it befitted her: any one looking at her for the first time might have supposed that long galleries and lackeys had always been a matter of course in her life; while her cousin Anna, who was really more familiar with these things, felt almost as much embarrassed as a rabbit suddenly deposited in that well-lit-space.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Deronda.c5.p4"><s sid="10" id="Deronda.c5.s10">But to a mind of general benevolence, wishing everybody to look well, it was rather exasperating to see how Gwendolen eclipsed others: how even the handsome Miss Lawe, explained to be the daughter of Lady Lawe, looked suddenly broad, heavy and inanimate; and how Miss Arrowpoint, unfortunately also dressed in white, immediately resembled a _carte-de- visite_ in which one would fancy the skirt alone to have been charged for.</s> <s sid="11" id="Deronda.c5.s11">Since Miss Arrowpoint was generally liked for the amiable unpretending way in which she wore her fortunes, and made a softening screen for the oddities of her mother, there seemed to be some unfitness in Gwendolen's looking so much more like a person of social importance.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Deronda.c5.p6"><s sid="14" id="Deronda.c5.s14">In fact, Gwendolen, not intending it, but intending the contrary, had offended her hostess, who, though not a splenetic or vindictive woman, had her susceptibilities.</s> <s sid="15" id="Deronda.c5.s15">Several conditions had met in the Lady of Quetcham which to the reasoners in that neighborhood seemed to have an essential connection with each other.</s> <s sid="16" id="Deronda.c5.s16">It was occasionally recalled that she had been the heiress of a fortune gained by some moist or dry business in the city, in order fully to account for her having a squat figure, a harsh parrot- like voice, and a systematically high head-dress; and since these points made her externally rather ridiculous, it appeared to many only natural that she should have what are called literary tendencies.</s> <s sid="17" id="Deronda.c5.s17">A little comparison would have shown that all these points are to be found apart; daughters of aldermen being often well-grown and well-featured, pretty women having sometimes harsh or husky voices, and the production of feeble literature being found compatible with the most diverse forms of _physique_, masculine as well as feminine.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Deronda.c5.p7"><s sid="18" id="Deronda.c5.s18">Gwendolen, who had a keen sense of absurdity in others, but was kindly disposed toward any one who could make life agreeable to her, meant to win Mrs. Arrowpoint by giving her an interest and attention beyond what others were probably inclined to show.</s> <s sid="19" id="Deronda.c5.s19">But self-confidence is apt to address itself to an imaginary dullness in others; as people who are well off speak in a cajoling tone to the poor, and those who are in the prime of life raise their voice and talk artificially to seniors, hastily conceiving them to be deaf and rather imbecile.</s> <s sid="20" id="Deronda.c5.s20">Gwendolen, with all her cleverness and purpose to be agreeable, could not escape that form of stupidity: it followed in her mind, unreflectingly, that because Mrs. Arrowpoint was ridiculous she was also likely to be wanting in penetration, and she went through her little scenes without suspicion that the various shades of her behavior were all noted.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Deronda.c9.p2"><s sid="3" id="Deronda.c9.s3">Eight months after the arrival of the family at Offendene, that is to say in the end of the following June, a rumor was spread in the neighborhood which to many persons was matter of exciting interest.</s> <s sid="4" id="Deronda.c9.s4">It had no reference to the results of the American war, but it was one which touched all classes within a certain circuit round Wanchester: the corn-factors, the brewers, the horse-dealers, and saddlers, all held it a laudable thing, and one which was to be rejoiced in on abstract grounds, as showing the value of an aristocracy in a free country like England; the blacksmith in the hamlet of Diplow felt that a good time had come round; the wives of laboring men hoped their nimble boys of ten or twelve would be taken into employ by the gentlemen in livery; and the farmers about Diplow admitted, with a tincture of bitterness and reserve that a man might now again perhaps have an easier market or exchange for a rick of old hay or a wagon-load of straw.</s> <s sid="5" id="Deronda.c9.s5">If such were the hopes of low persons not in society, it may be easily inferred that their betters had better reasons for satisfaction, probably connected with the pleasures of life rather than its business.</s> <s sid="6" id="Deronda.c9.s6">Marriage, however, must be considered as coming under both heads; and just as when a visit of majesty is announced, the dream of knighthood or a baronetcy is to be found under various municipal nightcaps, so the news in question raised a floating indeterminate vision of marriage in several well-bred imaginations.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Deronda.c9.p3"><s sid="7" id="Deronda.c9.s7">The news was that Diplow Hall, Sir Hugo Mallinger's place, which had for a couple of years turned its white window-shutters in a painfully wall-eyed manner on its fine elms and beeches, its lilied pool and grassy acres specked with deer, was being prepared for a tenant, and was for the rest of the summer and through the hunting season to be inhabited in a fitting style both as to house and stable.</s> <s sid="8" id="Deronda.c9.s8">But not by Sir Hugo himself: by his nephew, Mr. Mallinger Grandcourt, who was presumptive heir to the baronetcy, his uncle's marriage having produced nothing but girls.</s> <s sid="9" id="Deronda.c9.s9">Nor was this the only contingency with which fortune flattered young Grandcourt, as he was pleasantly called; for while the chance of the baronetcy came through his father, his mother had given a baronial streak to his blood, so that if certain intervening persons slightly painted in the middle distance died, he would become a baron and peer of this realm.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Deronda.c9.p4"><s sid="10" id="Deronda.c9.s10">It is the uneven allotment of nature that the male bird alone has the tuft, but we have not yet followed the advice of hasty philosophers who would have us copy nature entirely in these matters; and if Mr. Mallinger Grandcourt became a baronet or a peer, his wife would share the title-- which in addition to his actual fortune was certainly a reason why that wife, being at present unchosen, should be thought of by more than one person with a sympathetic interest as a woman sure to be well provided for.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Deronda.c9.p5"><s sid="11" id="Deronda.c9.s11">Some readers of this history will doubtless regard it as incredible that people should construct matrimonial prospects on the mere report that a bachelor of good fortune and possibilities was coming within reach, and will reject the statement as a mere outflow of gall: they will aver that neither they nor their first cousins have minds so unbridled; and that in fact this is not human nature, which would know that such speculations might turn out to be fallacious, and would therefore not entertain them.</s> <s sid="12" id="Deronda.c9.s12">But, let it be observed, nothing is here narrated of human nature generally: the history in its present stage concerns only a few people in a corner of Wessex--whose reputation, however, was unimpeached, and who, I am in the proud position of being able to state, were all on visiting terms with persons of rank.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Deronda.c9.p6"><s sid="13" id="Deronda.c9.s13">There were the Arrowpoints, for example, in their beautiful place at Quetcham: no one could attribute sordid views in relation to their daughter's marriage to parents who could leave her at least half a million; but having affectionate anxieties about their Catherine's position (she having resolutely refused Lord Slogan, an unexceptionable Irish peer, whose estate wanted nothing but drainage and population), they wondered, perhaps from something more than a charitable impulse, whether Mr. Grandcourt was good-looking, of sound constitution, virtuous, or at least reformed, and if liberal-conservative, not too liberal-conservative; and without wishing anybody to die, thought his succession to the title an event to be desired.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Deronda.c9.p7"><s sid="14" id="Deronda.c9.s14">If the Arrowpoints had such ruminations, it is the less surprising that they were stimulated in Mr. Gascoigne, who for being a clergyman was not the less subject to the anxieties of a parent and guardian; and we have seen how both he and Mrs. Gascoigne might by this time have come to feel that he was overcharged with the management of young creatures who were hardly to be held in with bit or bridle, or any sort of metaphor that would stand for judicious advice.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Deronda.c9.p8" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="Deronda.c9.s15">Naturally, people did not tell each other all they felt and thought about young Grandcourt's advent: on no subject is this openness found prudently practicable--not even on the generation of acids, or the destination of the fixed stars: for either your contemporary with a mind turned toward the same subjects may find your ideas ingenious and forestall you in applying them, or he may have other views on acids and fixed stars, and think ill of you in consequence.</s> <s sid="16" id="Deronda.c9.s16">Mr. Gascoigne did not ask Mr. Arrowpoint if he had any trustworthy source of information about Grandcourt considered as a husband for a charming girl; nor did Mrs. Arrowpoint observe to Mrs. Davilow that if the possible peer sought a wife in the neighborhood of Diplow, the only reasonable expectation was that he would offer his hand to Catherine, who, however, would not accept him unless he were in all respects fitted to secure her happiness.</s> <s sid="17" id="Deronda.c9.s17">Indeed, even to his wife the rector was silent as to the contemplation of any matrimonial result, from the probability that Mr. Grandcourt would see Gwendolen at the next Archery Meeting; though Mrs. Gascoigne's mind was very likely still more active in the same direction.</s> <s sid="18" id="Deronda.c9.s18">She had said interjectionally to her sister, <qs/>"It would be a mercy, Fanny, if that girl were well married!"<qe/> to which Mrs. Davilow discerning some criticism of her darling in the fervor of that wish, had not chosen to make any audible reply, though she had said inwardly, "You will not get her to marry for your pleasure"; the mild mother becoming rather saucy when she identified herself with her daughter.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Deronda.c9.p9" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="Deronda.c9.s19">To her husband Mrs. Gascoigne said, <qs/>"I hear Mr. Grandcourt has got two places of his own, but he comes to Diplow for the hunting.</s> <s sid="20" id="Deronda.c9.s20">It is to be hoped he will set a good example in the neighborhood.</s> <s sid="21" id="Deronda.c9.s21">Have you heard what sort of a young man he is, Henry?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Deronda.c9.p10"><s sid="22" id="Deronda.c9.s22">Mr. Gascoigne had not heard; at least, if his male acquaintances had gossiped in his hearing, he was not disposed to repeat their gossip, or to give it any emphasis in his own mind.</s> <s sid="23" id="Deronda.c9.s23">He held it futile, even if it had been becoming, to show any curiosity as to the past of a young man whose birth, wealth, and consequent leisure made many habits venial which under other circumstances would have been inexcusable.</s> <s sid="24" id="Deronda.c9.s24">Whatever Grandcourt had done, he had not ruined himself; and it is well-known that in gambling, for example, whether of the business or holiday sort, a man who has the strength of mind to leave off when he has only ruined others, is a reformed character.</s> <s sid="25" id="Deronda.c9.s25">This is an illustration merely:</s> <s sid="26" id="Deronda.c9.s26">Mr. Gascoigne had not heard that Grandcourt had been a gambler; and we can hardly pronounce him singular in feeling that a landed proprieter with a mixture of noble blood in his veins was not to be an object of suspicious inquiry like a reformed character who offers himself as your butler or footman.</s> <s sid="27" id="Deronda.c9.s27">Reformation, where a man can afford to do without it, can hardly be other than genuine.</s> <s sid="28" id="Deronda.c9.s28">Moreover, it was not certain on any other showing hitherto, that Mr. Grandcourt had needed reformation more than other young men in the ripe youth of five-and-thirty; and, at any rate, the significance of what he had been must be determined by what he actually was.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Deronda.c9.p11" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="Deronda.c9.s29">Mrs. Davilow, too, although she would not respond to her sister's pregnant remark, could not be inwardly indifferent to an advent that might promise a brilliant lot for Gwendolen.</s> <s sid="30" id="Deronda.c9.s30">A little speculation on "what may be" comes naturally, without encouragement--comes inevitably in the form of images, when unknown persons are mentioned; and Mr. Grandcourt's name raised in Mrs. Davilow's mind first of all the picture of a handsome, accomplished, excellent young man whom she would be satisfied with as a husband for her daughter; but then came the further speculation--would Gwendolen be satisfied with him?</s> <s sid="31" id="Deronda.c9.s31">There was no knowing what would meet that girl's taste or touch her affections--it might be something else than excellence; and thus the image of the perfect suitor gave way before a fluctuating combination of qualities that might be imagined to win Gwendolen's heart.</s> <s sid="32" id="Deronda.c9.s32">In the difficulty of arriving at the particular combination which would insure that result, the mother even said to herself, <qs/>"It would not signify about her being in love, if she would only accept the right person."<qe/></s> <s sid="33" id="Deronda.c9.s33">For whatever marriage had been for herself, how could she the less desire it for her daughter?</s> <s sid="34" id="Deronda.c9.s34">The difference her own misfortunes made was, that she never dared to dwell much to Gwendolen on the desirableness of marriage, dreading an answer something like that of the future Madame Roland, when her gentle mother urging the acceptance of a suitor, said, <qs/>"Tu seras heureuse, ma chere."<qe/></s> <s sid="35" id="Deronda.c9.s35"><qs/>"Oui, maman, comme toi."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Deronda.c9.p12"><s sid="36" id="Deronda.c9.s36">In relation to the problematic Mr. Grandcourt least of all would Mrs. Davilow have willingly let fall a hint of the aerial castle-building which she had the good taste to be ashamed of; for such a hint was likely enough to give an adverse poise to Gwendolen's own thought, and make her detest the desirable husband beforehand.</s> <s sid="37" id="Deronda.c9.s37">Since that scene after poor Rex's farewell visit, the mother had felt a new sense of peril in touching the mystery of her child's feeling, and in rashly determining what was her welfare: only she could think of welfare in no other shape than marriage.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="Deronda.c9.p13"><s sid="38" id="Deronda.c9.s38">The discussion of the dress that Gwendolen was to wear at the Archery Meeting was a relevant topic, however; and when it had been decided that as a touch of color on her white cashmere, nothing, for her complexion, was comparable to pale green--a feather which she was trying in her hat before the looking-glass having settled the question--Mrs. Davilow felt her ears tingle when Gwendolen, suddenly throwing herself into the attitude of drawing her bow, said with a look of comic enjoyment--</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Deronda.c9.p14" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="Deronda.c9.s39"><qs/>"How I pity all the other girls at the Archery Meeting--all thinking of Mr. Grandcourt!</s> <s sid="40" id="Deronda.c9.s40">And they have not a shadow of a chance."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Deronda.c9.p15"><s sid="41" id="Deronda.c9.s41">Mrs. Davilow had not the presence of mind to answer immediately, and Gwendolen turned round quickly toward her, saying, wickedly--</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Deronda.c9.p16" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="Deronda.c9.s42"><qs/>"Now you know they have not, mamma.</s> <s sid="43" id="Deronda.c9.s43">You and my uncle and aunt--you all intend him to fall in love with me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Deronda.c9.p17" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="Deronda.c9.s44">Mrs. Davilow, pigued into a little stratagem, said, <qs/>"Oh, my, dear, that is not so certain.</s> <s sid="45" id="Deronda.c9.s45">Miss Arrowpoint has charms which you have not."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="Deronda.c9.p18" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="Deronda.c9.s46"><qs/>"I know, but they demand thought.</s> <s sid="47" id="Deronda.c9.s47">My arrow will pierce him before he has time for thought.</s> <s sid="48" id="Deronda.c9.s48">He will declare himself my slave--I shall send him round the world to bring me back the wedding ring of a happy woman--in the meantime all the men who are between him and the title will die of different diseases--he will come back Lord Grandcourt--but without the ring--and fall at my feet.</s> <s sid="49" id="Deronda.c9.s49">I shall laugh at him--he will rise in resentment--I shall laugh more--he will call for his steed and ride to Quetcham, where he will find Miss Arrowpoint just married to a needy musician, Mrs. Arrowpoint tearing her cap off, and Mr. Arrowpoint standing by.</s> <s sid="50" id="Deronda.c9.s50">Exit Lord Grandcourt, who returns to Diplow, and, like M. Jabot, _change de linge_."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="Deronda.c9.p19"><s sid="51" id="Deronda.c9.s51">Was ever any young witch like this?</s> <s sid="52" id="Deronda.c9.s52">You thought of hiding things from her --sat upon your secret and looked innocent, and all the while she knew by the corner of your eye that it was exactly five pounds ten you were sitting on!</s> <s sid="53" id="Deronda.c9.s53">As well turn the key to keep out the damp!</s> <s sid="54" id="Deronda.c9.s54">It was probable that by dint of divination she already knew more than any one else did of Mr. Grandcourt.</s> <s sid="55" id="Deronda.c9.s55">That idea in Mrs. Davilow's mind prompted the sort of question which often comes without any other apparent reason than the faculty of speech and the not knowing what to do with it.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="Deronda.c9.p20" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="Deronda.c9.s56"><qs/>"Why, what kind of a man do you imagine him to be, Gwendolen?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="Deronda.c9.p21" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="Deronda.c9.s57"><qs/>"Let me see!"<qe/> said the witch, putting her forefinger to her lips, with a little frown, and then stretching out the finger with decision.</s> <s sid="58" id="Deronda.c9.s58"><qs/>"Short-- just above my shoulder--crying to make himself tall by turning up his mustache and keeping his beard long--a glass in his right eye to give him an air of distinction--a strong opinion about his waistcoat, but uncertain and trimming about the weather, on which he will try to draw me out.</s> <s sid="59" id="Deronda.c9.s59">He will stare at me all the while, and the glass in his eye will cause him to make horrible faces, especially when he smiles in a flattering way.</s> <s sid="60" id="Deronda.c9.s60">I shall cast down my eyes in consequence, and he will perceive that I am not indifferent to his attentions.</s> <s sid="61" id="Deronda.c9.s61">I shall dream that night that I am looking at the extraordinary face of a magnified insect--and the next morning he will make an offer of his hand; the sequel as before."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="Deronda.c9.p22" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="Deronda.c9.s62"><qs/>"That is a portrait of some one you have seen already, Gwen.</s> <s sid="63" id="Deronda.c9.s63">Mr. Grandcourt may be a delightful young man for what you know."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="Deronda.c9.p23" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="Deronda.c9.s64"><qs/>"Oh, yes,"<qe/> said Gwendolen, with a high note of careless admission, taking off her best hat and turning it round on her hand contemplatively.</s> <s sid="65" id="Deronda.c9.s65"><qs/>"I wonder what sort of behavior a delightful young man would have?</s> <s sid="66" id="Deronda.c9.s66">I know he would have hunters and racers, and a London house and two country-houses-- one with battlements and another with a veranda.</s> <s sid="67" id="Deronda.c9.s67">And I feel sure that with a little murdering he might get a title."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="Deronda.c9.p24"><s sid="68" id="Deronda.c9.s68">The irony of this speech was of the doubtful sort that has some genuine belief mixed up with it.</s> <s sid="69" id="Deronda.c9.s69">Poor Mrs. Davilow felt uncomfortable under it.</s> <s sid="70" id="Deronda.c9.s70">Her own meanings being usually literal and in intention innocent; and she said with a distressed brow:</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="Deronda.c9.p25" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="Deronda.c9.s71"><qs/>"Don't talk in that way, child, for heaven's sake! you do read such books --they give you such ideas of everything.</s> <s sid="72" id="Deronda.c9.s72">I declare when your aunt and I were your age we knew nothing about wickedness.</s> <s sid="73" id="Deronda.c9.s73">I think it was better so."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="Deronda.c9.p26" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="Deronda.c9.s74"><qs/>"Why did you not bring me up in that way, mamma?"<qe/> said Gwendolen.</s> <s sid="75" id="Deronda.c9.s75">But immediately perceiving in the crushed look and rising sob that she had given a deep wound, she tossed down her hat and knelt at her mother's feet crying--</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="Deronda.c9.p27" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="Deronda.c9.s76"><qs/>"Mamma, mamma!</s> <s sid="77" id="Deronda.c9.s77">I was only speaking in fun.</s> <s sid="78" id="Deronda.c9.s78">I meant nothing."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="Deronda.c9.p28" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="Deronda.c9.s79"><qs/>"How could I, Gwendolen?"<qe/> said poor Mrs. Davilow, unable to hear the retraction, and sobbing violently while she made the effort to speak.</s> <s sid="80" id="Deronda.c9.s80"><qs/>"Your will was always too strong for me--if everything else had been different."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="Deronda.c9.p29" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="Deronda.c9.s81">This disjoined logic was intelligible enough to the daughter.</s> <s sid="82" id="Deronda.c9.s82"><qs/>"Dear mamma, I don't find fault with you--I love you,"<qe/> said Gwendolen, really compunctious.</s> <s sid="83" id="Deronda.c9.s83"><qs/>"How can you help what I am?</s> <s sid="84" id="Deronda.c9.s84">Besides, I am very charming.</s> <s sid="85" id="Deronda.c9.s85">Come, now."<qe/></s> <s sid="86" id="Deronda.c9.s86">Here Gwendolen with her handkerchief gently rubbed away her mother's tears.</s> <s sid="87" id="Deronda.c9.s87"><qs/>"Really--I am contented with myself.</s> <s sid="88" id="Deronda.c9.s88">I like myself better than I should have liked my aunt and you.</s> <s sid="89" id="Deronda.c9.s89">How dreadfully dull you must have been!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="Deronda.c9.p30"><s sid="90" id="Deronda.c9.s90">Such tender cajolery served to quiet the mother, as it had often done before after like collisions.</s> <s sid="91" id="Deronda.c9.s91">Not that the collisions had often been repeated at the same point; for in the memory of both they left an association of dread with the particular topics which had occasioned them:</s> <s sid="92" id="Deronda.c9.s92">Gwendolen dreaded the unpleasant sense of compunction toward her mother, which was the nearest approach to self-condemnation and self-distrust that she had known; and Mrs. Davilow's timid maternal conscience dreaded whatever had brought on the slightest hint of reproach.</s> <s sid="93" id="Deronda.c9.s93">Hence, after this little scene, the two concurred in excluding Mr. Grandcourt from their conversation.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="Deronda.c9.p31"><s sid="94" id="Deronda.c9.s94">When Mr. Gascoigne once or twice referred to him, Mrs. Davilow feared least Gwendolen should betray some of her alarming keen-sightedness about what was probably in her uncle's mind; but the fear was not justified.</s> <s sid="95" id="Deronda.c9.s95">Gwendolen knew certain differences in the characters with which she was concerned as birds know climate and weather; and for the very reason that she was determined to evade her uncle's control, she was determined not to clash with him.</s> <s sid="96" id="Deronda.c9.s96">The good understanding between them was much fostered by their enjoyment of archery together:</s> <s sid="97" id="Deronda.c9.s97">Mr. Gascoigne, as one of the best bowmen in Wessex, was gratified to find the elements of like skill in his niece; and Gwendolen was the more careful not to lose the shelter of his fatherly indulgence, because since the trouble with Rex both Mrs. Gascoigne and Anna had been unable to hide what she felt to be a very unreasonable alienation from her.</s> <s sid="98" id="Deronda.c9.s98">Toward Anna she took some pains to behave with a regretful affectionateness; but neither of them dared to mention Rex's name, and Anna, to whom the thought of him was part of the air she breathed, was ill at ease with the lively cousin who had ruined his happiness.</s> <s sid="99" id="Deronda.c9.s99">She tried dutifully to repress any sign of her changed feeling; but who in pain can imitate the glance and hand-touch of pleasure.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="Deronda.c9.p32"><s sid="100" id="Deronda.c9.s100">This unfair resentment had rather a hardening effect on Gwendolen, and threw her into a more defiant temper.</s> <s sid="101" id="Deronda.c9.s101">Her uncle too might be offended if she refused the next person who fell in love with her; and one day when that idea was in her mind she said--</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="Deronda.c9.p33" type="speech"><s sid="102" id="Deronda.c9.s102"><qs/>"Mamma, I see now why girls are glad to be married--to escape being expected to please everybody but themselves."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="Deronda.c9.p34"><s sid="103" id="Deronda.c9.s103">Happily, Mr. Middleton was gone without having made any avowal; and notwithstanding the admiration for the handsome Miss Harleth, extending perhaps over thirty square miles in a part of Wessex well studded with families whose numbers included several disengaged young men, each glad to seat himself by the lively girl with whom it was so easy to get on in conversation,--notwithstanding these grounds for arguing that Gwendolen was likely to have other suitors more explicit than the cautious curate, the fact was not so.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="Deronda.c9.p35"><s sid="104" id="Deronda.c9.s104">Care has been taken not only that the trees should not sweep the stars down, but also that every man who admires a fair girl should not be enamored of her, and even that every man who is enamored should not necessarily declare himself.</s> <s sid="105" id="Deronda.c9.s105">There are various refined shapes in which the price of corn, known to be potent cause in their relation, might, if inquired into, show why a young lady, perfect in person, accomplishments, and costume, has not the trouble of rejecting many offers; and nature's order is certainly benignant in not obliging us one and all to be desperately in love with the most admirable mortal we have ever seen.</s> <s sid="106" id="Deronda.c9.s106">Gwendolen, we know, was far from holding that supremacy in the minds of all observers.</s> <s sid="107" id="Deronda.c9.s107">Besides, it was but a poor eight months since she had come to Offendene, and some inclinations become manifest slowly, like the sunward creeping of plants.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="Deronda.c9.p36"><s sid="108" id="Deronda.c9.s108">In face of this fact that not one of the eligible young men already in the neighborhood had made Gwendolen an offer, why should Mr. Grandcourt be thought of as likely to do what they had left undone?</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="Deronda.c9.p37"><s sid="109" id="Deronda.c9.s109">Perhaps because he was thought of as still more eligible; since a great deal of what passes for likelihood in the world is simply the reflex of a wish.</s> <s sid="110" id="Deronda.c9.s110">Mr. and Mrs. Arrowpoint, for example, having no anxiety that Miss Harleth should make a brilliant marriage, had quite a different likelihood in their minds.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="2" id="Deronda.c10.p2"><s sid="9" id="Deronda.c10.s9">Brackenshaw Park, where the Archery Meeting was held, looked out from its gentle heights far over the neighboring valley to the outlying eastern downs and the broad, slow rise of cultivated country, hanging like a vast curtain toward the west.</s> <s sid="10" id="Deronda.c10.s10">The castle which stood on the highest platform of the clustered hills, was built of rough-hewn limestone, full of lights and shadows made by the dark dust of lichens and the washings of the rain.</s> <s sid="11" id="Deronda.c10.s11">Masses of beech and fir sheltered it on the north, and spread down here and there along the green slopes like flocks seeking the water which gleamed below.</s> <s sid="12" id="Deronda.c10.s12">The archery-ground was a carefully-kept enclosure on a bit of table-land at the farthest end of the park, protected toward the southwest by tall elms and a thick screen of hollies, which kept the gravel walk and the bit of newly-mown turf where the targets were placed in agreeable afternoon shade.</s> <s sid="13" id="Deronda.c10.s13">The Archery Hall with an arcade in front showed like a white temple against the greenery on the north side.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Deronda.c10.p3"><s sid="14" id="Deronda.c10.s14">What could make a better background for the flower-groups of ladies, moving and bowing and turning their necks as it would become the leisurely lilies to do if they took to locomotion.</s> <s sid="15" id="Deronda.c10.s15">The sounds too were very pleasant to hear, even when the military band from Wanchester ceased to play: musical laughs in all the registers and a harmony of happy, friendly speeches, now rising toward mild excitement, now sinking to an agreeable murmur.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Deronda.c10.p4" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="Deronda.c10.s16">No open-air amusement could be much freer from those noisy, crowding conditions which spoil most modern pleasures; no Archery Meeting could be more select, the number of friends accompanying the members being restricted by an award of tickets, so as to keep the maximum within the limits of convenience for the dinner and ball to be held in the castle.</s> <s sid="17" id="Deronda.c10.s17">Within the enclosure no plebeian spectators were admitted except Lord Brackenshaw's tenants and their families, and of these it was chiefly the feminine members who used the privilege, bringing their little boys and girls or younger brothers and sisters.</s> <s sid="18" id="Deronda.c10.s18">The males among them relieved the insipidity of the entertainment by imaginative betting, in which the stake was <qs/>"anything you like,"<qe/> on their favorite archers; but the young maidens, having a different principle of discrimination, were considering which of those sweetly-dressed ladies they would choose to be, if the choice were allowed them.</s> <s sid="19" id="Deronda.c10.s19">Probably the form these rural souls would most have striven for as a tabernacle, was some other than Gwendolen's--one with more pink in her cheeks and hair of the most fashionable yellow; but among the male judges in the ranks immediately surrounding her there was unusual unanimity in pronouncing her the finest girl present.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Deronda.c10.p5"><s sid="20" id="Deronda.c10.s20">No wonder she enjoyed her existence on that July day.</s> <s sid="21" id="Deronda.c10.s21">Pre-eminence is sweet to those who love it, even under mediocre circumstances.</s> <s sid="22" id="Deronda.c10.s22">Perhaps it was not quite mythical that a slave has been proud to be bought first; and probably a barn-door fowl on sale, though he may not have understood himself to be called the best of a bad lot, may have a self-informed consciousness of his relative importance, and strut consoled.</s> <s sid="23" id="Deronda.c10.s23">But for complete enjoyment the outward and the inward must concur.</s> <s sid="24" id="Deronda.c10.s24">And that concurrence was happening to Gwendolen.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Deronda.c10.p6"><s sid="25" id="Deronda.c10.s25">Who can deny that bows and arrows are among the prettiest weapons in the world for feminine forms to play with?</s> <s sid="26" id="Deronda.c10.s26">They prompt attitudes full of grace and power, where that fine concentration of energy seen in all markmanship, is freed from associations of bloodshed.</s> <s sid="27" id="Deronda.c10.s27">The time-honored British resources of "killing something" is no longer carried on with bow and quiver; bands defending their passes against an invading nation fight under another sort of shade than a cloud of arrows; and poisoned darts are harmless survivals either in rhetoric or in regions comfortably remote.</s> <s sid="28" id="Deronda.c10.s28">Archery has no ugly smell of brimstone; breaks nobody's shins, breeds no athletic monsters; its only danger is that of failing, which for generous blood is enough to mould skilful action.</s> <s sid="29" id="Deronda.c10.s29">And among the Brackenshaw archers the prizes were all of the nobler symbolic kind; not properly to be carried off in a parcel, degrading honor into gain; but the gold arrow and the silver, the gold star and the silver, to be worn for a long time in sign of achievement and then transferred to the next who did excellently.</s> <s sid="30" id="Deronda.c10.s30">These signs of pre-eminence had the virtue of wreaths without their inconveniences, which might have produced a melancholy effect in the heat of the ball-room.</s> <s sid="31" id="Deronda.c10.s31">Altogether the Brackenshaw Archery Club was an institution framed with good taste, so as not to have by necessity any ridiculous incidents.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Deronda.c10.p7"><s sid="32" id="Deronda.c10.s32">And to-day all incalculable elements were in its favor.</s> <s sid="33" id="Deronda.c10.s33">There was mild warmth, and no wind to disturb either hair or drapery or the course of the arrow; all skillful preparation had fair play, and when there was a general march to extract the arrows, the promenade of joyous young creatures in light speech and laughter, the graceful movement in common toward a common object, was a show worth looking at.</s> <s sid="34" id="Deronda.c10.s34">Here Gwendolen seemed a Calypso among her nymphs.</s> <s sid="35" id="Deronda.c10.s35">It was in her attitudes and movements that every one was obliged to admit her surpassing charm.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Deronda.c10.p8" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="Deronda.c10.s36"><qs/>"That girl is like a high-mettled racer,"<qe/> said Lord Brackenshaw to young Clintock, one of the invited spectators.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Deronda.c10.p9" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="Deronda.c10.s37"><qs/>"First chop! tremendously pretty too,"<qe/><sls/> said the elegant Grecian, who had been paying her assiduous attention; <sle/><qs/>"I never saw her look better."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Deronda.c10.p10"><s sid="38" id="Deronda.c10.s38">Perhaps she had never looked so well.</s> <s sid="39" id="Deronda.c10.s39">Her face was beaming with young pleasure in which there was no malign rays of discontent; for being satisfied with her own chances, she felt kindly toward everybody and was satisfied with the universe.</s> <s sid="40" id="Deronda.c10.s40">Not to have the highest distinction in rank, not to be marked out as an heiress, like Miss Arrowpoint, gave an added triumph in eclipsing those advantages.</s> <s sid="41" id="Deronda.c10.s41">For personal recommendation she would not have cared to change the family group accompanying her for any other: her mamma's appearance would have suited an amiable duchess; her uncle and aunt Gascoigne with Anna made equally gratifying figures in their way; and Gwendolen was too full of joyous belief in herself to feel in the least jealous though Miss Arrowpoint was one of the best archeresses.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Deronda.c10.p11"><s sid="42" id="Deronda.c10.s42">Even the reappearance of the formidable Herr Klesmer, which caused some surprise in the rest of the company, seemed only to fall in with Gwendolen's inclination to be amused.</s> <s sid="43" id="Deronda.c10.s43">Short of Apollo himself, what great musical _maestro_ could make a good figure at an archery meeting?</s> <s sid="44" id="Deronda.c10.s44">There was a very satirical light in Gwendolen's eyes as she looked toward the Arrowpoint party on their first entrance, when the contrast between Klesmer and the average group of English country people seemed at its utmost intensity in the close neighborhood of his hosts--or patrons, as Mrs. Arrowpoint would have liked to hear them called, that she might deny the possibility of any longer patronizing genius, its royalty being universally acknowledged.</s> <s sid="45" id="Deronda.c10.s45">The contrast might have amused a graver personage than Gwendolen.</s> <s sid="46" id="Deronda.c10.s46">We English are a miscellaneous people, and any chance fifty of us will present many varieties of animal architecture or facial ornament; but it must be admitted that our prevailing expression is not that of a lively, impassioned race, preoccupied with the ideal and carrying the real as a mere make-weight.</s> <s sid="47" id="Deronda.c10.s47">The strong point of the English gentleman pure is the easy style of his figure and clothing; he objects to marked ins and outs in his costume, and he also objects to looking inspired.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Deronda.c10.p12"><s sid="48" id="Deronda.c10.s48">Fancy an assemblage where the men had all that ordinary stamp of the well- bred Englishman, watching the entrance of Herr Klesmer--his mane of hair floating backward in massive inconsistency with the chimney-pot hat, which had the look of having been put on for a joke above his pronounced but well-modeled features and powerful clear-shaven mouth and chin; his tall, thin figure clad in a way which, not being strictly English, was all the worse for its apparent emphasis of intention.</s> <s sid="49" id="Deronda.c10.s49">Draped in a loose garment with a Florentine _berretta_ on his head, he would have been fit to stand by the side of Leonardo de Vinci; but how when he presented himself in trousers which were not what English feeling demanded about the knees?-- and when the fire that showed itself in his glances and the movements of his head, as he looked round him with curiosity, was turned into comedy by a hat which ruled that mankind should have well-cropped hair and a staid demeanor, such, for example, as Mr. Arrowsmith's, whose nullity of face and perfect tailoring might pass everywhere without ridicule?</s> <s sid="50" id="Deronda.c10.s50">One feels why it is often better for greatness to be dead, and to have got rid of the outward man.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="Deronda.c10.p13"><s sid="51" id="Deronda.c10.s51">Many present knew Klesmer, or knew of him; but they had only seen him on candle-light occasions when he appeared simply as a musician, and he had not yet that supreme, world-wide celebrity which makes an artist great to the most ordinary people by their knowledge of his great expensiveness.</s> <s sid="52" id="Deronda.c10.s52">It was literally a new light for them to see him in--presented unexpectedly on this July afternoon in an exclusive society: some were inclined to laugh, others felt a little disgust at the want of judgment shown by the Arrowpoints in this use of an introductory card.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Deronda.c10.p14" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="Deronda.c10.s53"><qs/>"What extreme guys those artistic fellows usually are?"<qe/> said young Clintock to Gwendolen.</s> <s sid="54" id="Deronda.c10.s54"><qs/>"Do look at the figure he cuts, bowing with his hand on his heart to Lady Brackenshaw--and Mrs. Arrowpoint's feather just reaching his shoulder."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Deronda.c10.p15" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="Deronda.c10.s55"><qs/>"You are one of the profane,"<qe/> said Gwendolen.</s> <s sid="56" id="Deronda.c10.s56"><qs/>"You are blind to the majesty of genius.</s> <s sid="57" id="Deronda.c10.s57">Herr Klesmer smites me with awe; I feel crushed in his presence; my courage all oozes from me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Deronda.c10.p16" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="Deronda.c10.s58"><qs/>"Ah, you understand all about his music."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Deronda.c10.p17" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="Deronda.c10.s59"><qs/>"No, indeed,"<qe/><sls/> said Gwendolen, with a light laugh; <sle/><qs/>"it is he who understands all about mine and thinks it pitiable."<qe/></s> <s sid="60" id="Deronda.c10.s60">Klesmer's verdict on her singing had been an easier joke to her since he had been struck by her _plastik_.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="Deronda.c10.p18" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="Deronda.c10.s61"><qs/>"It is not addressed to the ears of the future, I suppose.</s> <s sid="62" id="Deronda.c10.s62">I'm glad of that: it suits mine."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="Deronda.c10.p19" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="Deronda.c10.s63"><qs/>"Oh, you are very kind.</s> <s sid="64" id="Deronda.c10.s64">But how remarkably well Miss Arrowpoint looks to- day!</s> <s sid="65" id="Deronda.c10.s65">She would make quite a fine picture in that gold-colored dress."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="Deronda.c10.p20" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="Deronda.c10.s66"><qs/>"Too splendid, don't you think?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="Deronda.c10.p21" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="Deronda.c10.s67"><qs/>"Well, perhaps a little too symbolical--too much like the figure of Wealth in an allegory."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="Deronda.c10.p22"><s sid="68" id="Deronda.c10.s68">This speech of Gwendolen's had rather a malicious sound, but it was not really more than a bubble of fun.</s> <s sid="69" id="Deronda.c10.s69">She did not wish Miss Arrowpoint or any one else to be out of the way, believing in her own good fortune even more than in her skill.</s> <s sid="70" id="Deronda.c10.s70">The belief in both naturally grew stronger as the shooting went on, for she promised to achieve one of the best scores--a success which astonished every one in a new member; and to Gwendolen's temperament one success determined another.</s> <s sid="71" id="Deronda.c10.s71">She trod on air, and all things pleasant seemed possible.</s> <s sid="72" id="Deronda.c10.s72">The hour was enough for her, and she was not obliged to think what she should do next to keep her life at the due pitch.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="Deronda.c10.p23" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="Deronda.c10.s73"><qs/>"How does the scoring stand, I wonder?"<qe/> said Lady Brackenshaw, a gracious personage who, adorned with two little girls and a boy of stout make, sat as lady paramount.</s> <s sid="74" id="Deronda.c10.s74">Her lord had come up to her in one of the intervals of shooting.</s> <s sid="75" id="Deronda.c10.s75"><qs/>"It seems to me that Miss Harleth is likely to win the gold arrow."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="Deronda.c10.p24" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="Deronda.c10.s76"><qs/>"Gad, I think she will, if she carries it on! she is running Juliet Fenn hard.</s> <s sid="77" id="Deronda.c10.s77">It is wonderful for one in her first year.</s> <s sid="78" id="Deronda.c10.s78">Catherine is not up to her usual mark,"<qe/> continued his lordship, turning to the heiress's mother who sat near.</s> <s sid="79" id="Deronda.c10.s79"><qs/>"But she got the gold arrow last time.</s> <s sid="80" id="Deronda.c10.s80">And there's a luck even in these games of skill.</s> <s sid="81" id="Deronda.c10.s81">That's better.</s> <s sid="82" id="Deronda.c10.s82">It gives the hinder ones a chance."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="Deronda.c10.p25" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="Deronda.c10.s83"><qs/>"Catherine will be very glad for others to win,"<qe/><sss/> said Mrs. Arrowpoint, <sse/><qs/>"she is so magnanimous.</s> <s sid="84" id="Deronda.c10.s84">It was entirely her considerateness that made us bring Herr Klesmer instead of Canon Stopley, who had expressed a wish to come.</s> <s sid="85" id="Deronda.c10.s85">For her own pleasure, I am sure she would rather have brought the Canon; but she is always thinking of others.</s> <s sid="86" id="Deronda.c10.s86">I told her it was not quite _en regle_ to bring one so far out of our own set; but she said, <alt-qs/>'Genius itself is not _en regle_; it comes into the world to make new rules.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="87" id="Deronda.c10.s87">And one must admit that."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="Deronda.c10.p26" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="Deronda.c10.s88"><qs/>"Ay, to be sure,"<qe/><sls/> said Lord Brackenshaw, in a tone of careless dismissal, adding quickly, <sle/><qs/>"For my part, I am not magnanimous; I should like to win.</s> <s sid="89" id="Deronda.c10.s89">But, confound it!</s> <s sid="90" id="Deronda.c10.s90">I never have the chance now.</s> <s sid="91" id="Deronda.c10.s91">I'm getting old and idle.</s> <s sid="92" id="Deronda.c10.s92">The young ones beat me.</s> <s sid="93" id="Deronda.c10.s93">As old Nestor says--the gods don't give us everything at one time:</s> <s sid="94" id="Deronda.c10.s94">I was a young fellow once, and now I am getting an old and wise one.</s> <s sid="95" id="Deronda.c10.s95">Old, at any rate; which is a gift that comes to everybody if they live long enough, so it raises no jealousy."<qe/></s> <s sid="96" id="Deronda.c10.s96">The Earl smiled comfortably at his wife.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="Deronda.c10.p27" type="speech"><s sid="97" id="Deronda.c10.s97"><qs/>"Oh, my lord, people who have been neighbors twenty years must not talk to each other about age,"<qe/> said Mrs. Arrowpoint.</s> <s sid="98" id="Deronda.c10.s98"><qs/>"Years, as the Tuscans say, are made for the letting of houses.</s> <s sid="99" id="Deronda.c10.s99">But where is our new neighbor?</s> <s sid="100" id="Deronda.c10.s100">I thought Mr. Grandcourt was to be here to-day."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="Deronda.c10.p28" type="speech"><s sid="101" id="Deronda.c10.s101"><qs/>"Ah, by the way, so he was.</s> <s sid="102" id="Deronda.c10.s102">The time's getting on too,"<qe/> said his lordship, looking at his watch.</s> <s sid="103" id="Deronda.c10.s103"><qs/>"But he only got to Diplow the other day.</s> <s sid="104" id="Deronda.c10.s104">He came to us on Tuesday and said he had been a little bothered.</s> <s sid="105" id="Deronda.c10.s105">He may have been pulled in another direction.</s> <s sid="106" id="Deronda.c10.s106">Why, Gascoigne!"<qe/><sls/>--the rector was just then crossing at a little distance with Gwendolen on his arm, and turned in compliance with the call--<sle/><qs/>"this is a little too bad; you not only beat us yourself, but you bring up your niece to beat all the archeresses."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="Deronda.c10.p29" type="speech"><s sid="107" id="Deronda.c10.s107"><qs/>"It _is_ rather scandalous in her to get the better of elder members,"<qe/> said Mr. Gascoigne, with much inward satisfaction curling his short upper lip.</s> <s sid="108" id="Deronda.c10.s108"><qs/>"But it is not my doing, my lord.</s> <s sid="109" id="Deronda.c10.s109">I only meant her to make a tolerable figure, without surpassing any one."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="Deronda.c10.p30" type="speech"><s sid="110" id="Deronda.c10.s110"><qs/>"It is not my fault, either,"<qe/> said Gwendolen, with pretty archness.</s> <s sid="111" id="Deronda.c10.s111"><qs/>"If I am to aim, I can't help hitting."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="Deronda.c10.p31" type="speech"><s sid="112" id="Deronda.c10.s112"><qs/>"Ay, ay, that may be a fatal business for some people,"<qe/><sls/> said Lord Brackenshaw, good-humoredly; then taking out his watch and looking at Mrs. Arrowpoint again--<sle/><qs/>"The time's getting on, as you say.</s> <s sid="113" id="Deronda.c10.s113">But Grandcourt is always late.</s> <s sid="114" id="Deronda.c10.s114">I notice in town he's always late, and he's no bowman-- understands nothing about it.</s> <s sid="115" id="Deronda.c10.s115">But I told him he must come; he would see the flower of the neighborhood here.</s> <s sid="116" id="Deronda.c10.s116">He asked about you--had seen Arrowpoint's card.</s> <s sid="117" id="Deronda.c10.s117">I think you had not made his acquaintance in town.</s> <s sid="118" id="Deronda.c10.s118">He has been a good deal abroad.</s> <s sid="119" id="Deronda.c10.s119">People don't know him much."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="Deronda.c10.p32" type="speech"><s sid="120" id="Deronda.c10.s120"><qs/>"No; we are strangers,"<qe/> said Mrs. Arrowpoint.</s> <s sid="121" id="Deronda.c10.s121"><qs/>"But that is not what might have been expected.</s> <s sid="122" id="Deronda.c10.s122">For his uncle Sir Hugo Mallinger and I are great friends when we meet."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="Deronda.c10.p34"><s sid="126" id="Deronda.c10.s126">Gwendolen chose to go too and be deposited in the same group with her mamma and aunt until she had to shoot again.</s> <s sid="127" id="Deronda.c10.s127">That Mr. Grandcourt might after all not appear on the archery-ground, had begun to enter into Gwendolen's thought as a possible deduction from the completeness of her pleasure.</s> <s sid="128" id="Deronda.c10.s128">Under all her saucy satire, provoked chiefly by her divination that her friends thought of him as a desirable match for her, she felt something very far from indifference as to the impression she would make on him.</s> <s sid="129" id="Deronda.c10.s129">True, he was not to have the slightest power over her (for Gwendolen had not considered that the desire to conquer is itself a sort of subjection); she had made up her mind that he was to be one of those complimentary and assiduously admiring men of whom even her narrow experience had shown her several with various-colored beards and various styles of bearing; and the sense that her friends would want her to think him delightful, gave her a resistant inclination to presuppose him ridiculous.</s> <s sid="130" id="Deronda.c10.s130">But that was no reason why she could spare his presence: and even a passing prevision of trouble in case she despised and refused him, raised not the shadow of a wish that he should save her that trouble by showing no disposition to make her an offer.</s> <s sid="131" id="Deronda.c10.s131">Mr. Grandcourt taking hardly any notice of her, and becoming shortly engaged to Miss Arrowpoint, was not a picture which flattered her imagination.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="Deronda.c10.p35"><s sid="132" id="Deronda.c10.s132">Hence Gwendolen had been all ear to Lord Brackenshaw's mode of accounting for Grandcourt's non-appearance; and when he did arrive, no consciousness --not even Mrs. Arrowpoint's or Mr. Gascoigne's--was more awake to the fact than hers, although she steadily avoided looking toward any point where he was likely to be.</s> <s sid="133" id="Deronda.c10.s133">There should be no slightest shifting of angles to betray that it was of any consequence to her whether the much-talked-of Mr. Mallinger Grandcourt presented himself or not.</s> <s sid="134" id="Deronda.c10.s134">She became again absorbed in the shooting, and so resolutely abstained from looking round observantly that, even supposing him to have taken a conspicuous place among the spectators, it might be clear she was not aware of him.</s> <s sid="135" id="Deronda.c10.s135">And all the while the certainty that he was there made a distinct thread in her consciousness.</s> <s sid="136" id="Deronda.c10.s136">Perhaps her shooting was the better for it: at any rate, it gained in precision, and she at last raised a delightful storm of clapping and applause by three hits running in the gold--a feat which among the Brackenshaw arches had not the vulgar reward of a shilling poll-tax, but that of a special gold star to be worn on the breast.</s> <s sid="137" id="Deronda.c10.s137">That moment was not only a happy one to herself--it was just what her mamma and her uncle would have chosen for her.</s> <s sid="138" id="Deronda.c10.s138">There was a general falling into ranks to give her space that she might advance conspicuously to receive the gold star from the hands of Lady Brackenshaw; and the perfect movement of her fine form was certainly a pleasant thing to behold in the clear afternoon light when the shadows were long and still.</s> <s sid="139" id="Deronda.c10.s139">She was the central object of that pretty picture, and every one present must gaze at her.</s> <s sid="140" id="Deronda.c10.s140">That was enough: she herself was determined to see nobody in particular, or to turn her eyes any way except toward Lady Brackenshaw, but her thoughts undeniably turned in other ways.</s> <s sid="141" id="Deronda.c10.s141">It entered a little into her pleasure that Herr Klesmer must be observing her at a moment when music was out of the question, and his superiority very far in the back-ground; for vanity is as ill at ease under indifference as tenderness is under a love which it cannot return; and the unconquered Klesmer threw a trace of his malign power even across her pleasant consciousness that Mr. Grandcourt was seeing her to the utmost advantage, and was probably giving her an admiration unmixed with criticism.</s> <s sid="142" id="Deronda.c10.s142">She did not expect to admire _him_, but that was not necessary to her peace of mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Deronda.c11.p2" type="speech"><s sid="2" id="Deronda.c11.s2">Mr. Grandcourt's wish to be introduced had no suddenness for Gwendolen; but when Lord Brackenshaw moved aside a little for the prefigured stranger to come forward and she felt herself face to face with the real man, there was a little shock which flushed her cheeks and vexatiously deepened with her consciousness of it.</s> <s sid="3" id="Deronda.c11.s3">The shock came from the reversal of her expectations:</s> <s sid="4" id="Deronda.c11.s4">Grandcourt could hardly have been more unlike all her imaginary portraits of him.</s> <s sid="5" id="Deronda.c11.s5">He was slightly taller than herself, and their eyes seemed to be on a level; there was not the faintest smile on his face as he looked at her, not a trace of self-consciousness or anxiety in his bearing: when he raised his hat he showed an extensive baldness surrounded with a mere fringe of reddish-blonde hair, but he also showed a perfect hand; the line of feature from brow to chin undisguised by beard was decidedly handsome, with only moderate departures from the perpendicular, and the slight whisker too was perpendicular.</s> <s sid="6" id="Deronda.c11.s6">It was not possible for a human aspect to be freer from grimace or solicitous wrigglings: also it was perhaps not possible for a breathing man wide awake to look less animated.</s> <s sid="7" id="Deronda.c11.s7">The correct Englishman, drawing himself up from his bow into rigidity, assenting severely, and seemed to be in a state of internal drill, suggests a suppressed vivacity, and may be suspected of letting go with some violence when he is released from parade; but Grandcourt's bearing had no rigidity, it inclined rather to the flaccid.</s> <s sid="8" id="Deronda.c11.s8">His complexion had a faded fairness resembling that of an actress when bare of the artificial white and red; his long narrow gray eyes expressed nothing but indifference.</s> <s sid="9" id="Deronda.c11.s9">Attempts at description are stupid: who can all at once describe a human being? even when he is presented to us we only begin that knowledge of his appearance which must be completed by innumerable impressions under differing circumstances.</s> <s sid="10" id="Deronda.c11.s10">We recognize the alphabet; we are not sure of the language.</s> <s sid="11" id="Deronda.c11.s11">I am only mentioning the point that Gwendolen saw by the light of a prepared contrast in the first minutes of her meeting with Grandcourt: they were summed up in the words, <qs/>"He is not ridiculous."<qe/></s> <s sid="12" id="Deronda.c11.s12">But forthwith Lord Brackenshaw was gone, and what is called conversation had begun, the first and constant element in it being that Grandcourt looked at Gwendolen persistently with a slightly exploring gaze, but without change of expression, while she only occasionally looked at him with a flash of observation a little softened by coquetry.</s> <s sid="13" id="Deronda.c11.s13">Also, after her answers there was a longer or shorter pause before he spoke again.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Deronda.c11.p11"><s sid="26" id="Deronda.c11.s26">(Pause, during which Gwendolen made several interpretations of her own speech.)</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Deronda.c11.p14"><s sid="30" id="Deronda.c11.s30">(Pause, wherein Gwendolen recalled what she had heard about Grandcourt's position, and decided that he was the most aristocratic-looking man she had ever seen.)</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="Deronda.c11.p20"><s sid="40" id="Deronda.c11.s40">(Pause, wherein Gwendolen wondered whether Grandcourt would like what she said, but assured herself that she was not going to disguise her tastes.)</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="Deronda.c11.p29"><s sid="56" id="Deronda.c11.s56">(Pause, during which it occurred to Gwendolen that a man of cold and distinguished manners might possibly be a dull companion; but on the other hand she thought that most persons were dull, that she had not observed husbands to be companions--and that after all she was not going to accept Grandcourt.)</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="Deronda.c11.p30" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="Deronda.c11.s57"><qs/>"Why are you dull?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="Deronda.c11.p32"><s sid="61" id="Deronda.c11.s61">(Pause, during which Gwendolen reflected that the life of an unmarried woman who could not go about and had no command of anything must necessarily be dull through all degrees of comparison as time went on.)</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="Deronda.c11.p35"><s sid="67" id="Deronda.c11.s67">(Pause, wherein Gwendolen was thinking that men had been known to choose some one else than the woman they most admired, and recalled several experiences of that kind in novels.)</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="Deronda.c11.p38"><s sid="74" id="Deronda.c11.s74">Gwendolen found a relief for herself by thus changing the situation: not that the _tete-a-tete_ was quite disagreeable to her; but while it lasted she apparently could not get rid of the unwonted flush in her cheeks and the sense of surprise which made her feel less mistress of herself than usual.</s> <s sid="75" id="Deronda.c11.s75">And this Mr. Grandcourt, who seemed to feel his own importance more than he did hers--a sort of unreasonableness few of us can tolerate--must not take for granted that he was of great moment to her, or that because others speculated on him as a desirable match she held herself altogether at his beck.</s> <s sid="76" id="Deronda.c11.s76">How Grandcourt had filled up the pauses will be more evident hereafter.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="Deronda.c11.p41" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="Deronda.c11.s81">It was impossible to be jealous of Juliet Fenn, a girl as middling as mid- day market in everything but her archery and plainness, in which last she was noticeable like her father: underhung and with receding brow resembling that of the more intelligent fishes.</s> <s sid="82" id="Deronda.c11.s82">(Surely, considering the importance which is given to such an accident in female offspring, marriageable men, or what the new English calls <qs/>"intending bridegrooms,"<qe/> should look at themselves dispassionately in the glass, since their natural selection of a mate prettier than themselves is not certain to bar the effect of their own ugliness.)</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="Deronda.c11.p42"><s sid="83" id="Deronda.c11.s83">There was now a lively movement in the mingling groups, which carried the talk along with it.</s> <s sid="84" id="Deronda.c11.s84">Every one spoke to every one else by turns, and Gwendolen, who chose to see what was going on around her now, observed that Grandcourt was having Klesmer presented to him by some one unknown to her--a middle-aged man, with dark, full face and fat hands, who seemed to be on the easiest terms with both, and presently led the way in joining the Arrowpoints, whose acquaintance had already been made by both him and Grandcourt.</s> <s sid="85" id="Deronda.c11.s85">Who this stranger was she did not care much to know; but she wished to observe what was Grandcourt's manner toward others than herself.</s> <s sid="86" id="Deronda.c11.s86">Precisely the same: except that he did not look much at Miss Arrowpoint, but rather at Klesmer, who was speaking with animation--now stretching out his long fingers horizontally, now pointing downward with his fore-finger, now folding his arms and tossing his mane, while he addressed himself first to one and then to the other, including Grandcourt, who listened with an impassive face and narrow eyes, his left fore-finger in his waistcoat-pocket, and his right slightly touching his thin whisker.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="Deronda.c11.p43" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="Deronda.c11.s87"><qs/>"I wonder which style Miss Arrowpoint admires most,"<qe/> was a thought that glanced through Gwendolen's mind, while her eyes and lips gathered rather a mocking expression.</s> <s sid="88" id="Deronda.c11.s88">But she would not indulge her sense of amusement by watching, as if she were curious, and she gave all her animation to those immediately around her, determined not to care whether Mr. Grandcourt came near her again or not.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="Deronda.c11.p50"><s sid="98" id="Deronda.c11.s98">In the ladies' dining-room it was evident that Gwendolen was not a general favorite with her own sex: there were no beginnings of intimacy between her and other girls, and in conversation they rather noticed what she said than spoke to her in free exchange.</s> <s sid="99" id="Deronda.c11.s99">Perhaps it was that she was not much interested in them, and when left alone in their company had a sense of empty benches.</s> <s sid="100" id="Deronda.c11.s100">Mrs. Vulcany once remarked that Miss Harleth was too fond of the gentlemen; but we know that she was not in the least fond of them-- she was only fond of their homage--and women did not give her homage.</s> <s sid="101" id="Deronda.c11.s101">The exception to this willing aloofness from her was Miss Arrowpoint, who often managed unostentatiously to be by her side, and talked to her with quiet friendliness.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Deronda.c15.p3"><s sid="4" id="Deronda.c15.s4">While she was going back to England, Grandcourt was coming to find her; coming, that is, after his own manner--not in haste by express straight from Diplow to Leubronn, where she was understood to be; but so entirely without hurry that he was induced by the presence of some Russian acquaintances to linger at Baden-Baden and make various appointments with them, which, however, his desire to be at Leubronn ultimately caused him to break.</s> <s sid="5" id="Deronda.c15.s5">Grandcourt's passions were of the intermittent, flickering kind: never flaming out strongly.</s> <s sid="6" id="Deronda.c15.s6">But a great deal of life goes on without strong passion: myriads of cravats are carefully tied, dinners attended, even speeches made proposing the health of august personages without the zest arising from a strong desire.</s> <s sid="7" id="Deronda.c15.s7">And a man may make a good appearance in high social positions--may be supposed to know the classics, to have his reserves on science, a strong though repressed opinion on politics, and all the sentiments of the English gentleman, at a small expense of vital energy.</s> <s sid="8" id="Deronda.c15.s8">Also, he may be obstinate or persistent at the same low rate, and may even show sudden impulses which have a false air of daemonic strength because they seem inexplicable, though perhaps their secret lies merely in the want of regulated channels for the soul to move in--good and sufficient ducts of habit without which our nature easily turns to mere ooze and mud, and at any pressure yields nothing but a spurt or a puddle.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Deronda.c15.p4"><s sid="9" id="Deronda.c15.s9">Grandcourt had not been altogether displeased by Gwendolen's running away from the splendid chance he was holding out to her.</s> <s sid="10" id="Deronda.c15.s10">The act had some piquancy for him.</s> <s sid="11" id="Deronda.c15.s11">He liked to think that it was due to resentment of his careless behavior in Cardell Chase, which, when he came to consider it, did appear rather cool.</s> <s sid="12" id="Deronda.c15.s12">To have brought her so near a tender admission, and then to have walked headlong away from further opportunities of winning the consent which he had made her understand him to be asking for, was enough to provoke a girl of spirit; and to be worth his mastering it was proper that she should have some spirit.</s> <s sid="13" id="Deronda.c15.s13">Doubtless she meant him to follow her, and it was what he meant too.</s> <s sid="14" id="Deronda.c15.s14">But for a whole week he took no measures toward starting, and did not even inquire where Miss Harleth was gone.</s> <s sid="15" id="Deronda.c15.s15">Mr. Lush felt a triumph that was mingled with much distrust; for Grandcourt had said no word to him about her, and looked as neutral as an alligator; there was no telling what might turn up in the slowly-churning chances of his mind.</s> <s sid="16" id="Deronda.c15.s16">Still, to have put off a decision was to have made room for the waste of Grandcourt's energy.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Deronda.c15.p5"><s sid="17" id="Deronda.c15.s17">The guests at Diplow felt more curiosity than their host.</s> <s sid="18" id="Deronda.c15.s18">How was it that nothing more was heard of Miss Harleth?</s> <s sid="19" id="Deronda.c15.s19">Was it credible that she had refused Mr. Grandcourt?</s> <s sid="20" id="Deronda.c15.s20">Lady Flora Hollis, a lively middle-aged woman, well endowed with curiosity, felt a sudden interest in making a round of calls with Mrs. Torrington, including the rectory, Offendene, and Quetcham, and thus not only got twice over, but also discussed with the Arrowpoints, the information that Miss Harleth was gone to Leubronn, with some old friends, the Baron and Baroness von Langen; for the immediate agitation and disappointment of Mrs. Davilow and the Gascoignes had resolved itself into a wish that Gwendolen's disappearance should not be interpreted as anything eccentric or needful to be kept secret.</s> <s sid="21" id="Deronda.c15.s21">The rector's mind, indeed, entertained the possibility that the marriage was only a little deferred, for Mrs. Davilow had not dared to tell him of the bitter determination with which Gwendolen had spoken.</s> <s sid="22" id="Deronda.c15.s22">And in spite of his practical ability, some of his experience had petrified into maxims and quotations.</s> <s sid="23" id="Deronda.c15.s23">Amaryllis fleeing desired that her hiding-place should be known; and that love will find out the way "over the mountain and over the wave" may be said without hyperbole in this age of steam.</s> <s sid="24" id="Deronda.c15.s24">Gwendolen, he conceived, was an Amaryllis of excellent sense but coquettish daring; the question was whether she had dared too much.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Deronda.c15.p6"><s sid="25" id="Deronda.c15.s25">Lady Flora, coming back charged with news about Miss Harleth, saw no good reason why she should not try whether she could electrify Mr. Grandcourt by mentioning it to him at the table; and in doing so shot a few hints of a notion having got abroad that he was a disappointed adorer.</s> <s sid="26" id="Deronda.c15.s26">Grandcourt heard with quietude, but with attention; and the next day he ordered Lush to bring about a decent reason for breaking up the party at Diplow by the end of another week, as he meant to go yachting to the Baltic or somewhere--it being impossible to stay at Diplow as if he were a prisoner on parole, with a set of people whom he had never wanted.</s> <s sid="27" id="Deronda.c15.s27">Lush needed no clearer announcement that Grandcourt was going to Leubronn; but he might go after the manner of a creeping billiard-ball and stick on the way.</s> <s sid="28" id="Deronda.c15.s28">What Mr. Lush intended was to make himself indispensable so that he might go too, and he succeeded; Gwendolen's repulsion for him being a fact that only am used his patron, and made him none the less willing to have Lush always at hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Deronda.c15.p7"><s sid="29" id="Deronda.c15.s29">This was how it happened that Grandcourt arrived at the _Czarina_ on the fifth day after Gwendolen had left Leubronn, and found there his uncle, Sir Hugo Mallinger, with his family, including Deronda.</s> <s sid="30" id="Deronda.c15.s30">It is not necessarily a pleasure either to the reigning power or the heir presumptive when their separate affairs--a--touch of gout, say, in the one, and a touch of willfulness in the other--happen to bring them to the same spot.</s> <s sid="31" id="Deronda.c15.s31">Sir Hugo was an easy-tempered man, tolerant both of differences and defects; but a point of view different from his own concerning the settlement of the family estates fretted him rather more than if it had concerned Church discipline or the ballot, and faults were the less venial for belonging to a person whose existence was inconvenient to him.</s> <s sid="32" id="Deronda.c15.s32">In no case could Grandcourt have been a nephew after his own heart; but as the presumptive heir to the Mallinger estates he was the sign and embodiment of a chief grievance in the baronet's life--the want of a son to inherit the lands, in no portion of which had he himself more than a life- interest.</s> <s sid="33" id="Deronda.c15.s33">For in the ill-advised settlement which his father, Sir Francis, had chosen to make by will, even Diplow with its modicum of land had been left under the same conditions as the ancient and wide inheritance of the two Toppings--Diplow, where Sir Hugo had lived and hunted through many a season in his younger years, and where his wife and daughters ought to have been able to retire after his death.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Deronda.c15.p8"><s sid="34" id="Deronda.c15.s34">This grievance had naturally gathered emphasis as the years advanced, and Lady Mallinger, after having had three daughters in quick succession, had remained for eight years till now that she was over forty without producing so much as another girl; while Sir Hugo, almost twenty years older, was at a time of life when, notwithstanding the fashionable retardation of most things from dinners to marriages, a man's hopefulness is apt to show signs of wear, until restored by second childhood.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Deronda.c15.p9"><s sid="35" id="Deronda.c15.s35">In fact, he had begun to despair of a son, and this confirmation of Grandcourt's interest in the estates certainly tended to make his image and presence the more unwelcome; but, on the other hand, it carried circumstances which disposed Sir Hugo to take care that the relation between them should be kept as friendly as possible.</s> <s sid="36" id="Deronda.c15.s36">It led him to dwell on a plan which had grown up side by side with his disappointment of an heir; namely, to try and secure Diplow as a future residence for Lady Mallinger and her daughters, and keep this pretty bit of the family inheritance for his own offspring in spite of that disappointment.</s> <s sid="37" id="Deronda.c15.s37">Such knowledge as he had of his nephew's disposition and affairs encouraged the belief that Grandcourt might consent to a transaction by which he would get a good sum of ready money, as an equivalent for his prospective interest in the domain of Diplow and the moderate amount of land attached to it.</s> <s sid="38" id="Deronda.c15.s38">If, after all, the unhoped-for son should be born, the money would have been thrown away, and Grandcourt would have been paid for giving up interests that had turned out good for nothing; but Sir Hugo set down this risk as _nil_, and of late years he had husbanded his fortune so well by the working of mines and the sale of leases that he was prepared for an outlay.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Deronda.c15.p10"><s sid="39" id="Deronda.c15.s39">Here was an object that made him careful to avoid any quarrel with Grandcourt.</s> <s sid="40" id="Deronda.c15.s40">Some years before, when he was making improvements at the Abbey, and needed Grandcourt's concurrence in his felling an obstructive mass of timber on the demesne, he had congratulated himself on finding that there was no active spite against him in his nephew's peculiar mind; and nothing had since occurred to make them hate each other more than was compatible with perfect politeness, or with any accommodation that could be strictly mutual.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Deronda.c15.p11"><s sid="41" id="Deronda.c15.s41">Grandcourt, on his side, thought his uncle a superfluity and a bore, and felt that the list of things in general would be improved whenever Sir Hugo came to be expunged.</s> <s sid="42" id="Deronda.c15.s42">But he had been made aware through Lush, always a useful medium, of the baronet's inclinations concerning Diplow, and he was gratified to have the alternative of the money in his mind: even if he had not thought it in the least likely that he would choose to accept it, his sense of power would have been flattered by his being able to refuse what Sir Hugo desired.</s> <s sid="43" id="Deronda.c15.s43">The hinted transaction had told for something among the motives which had made him ask for a year's tenancy of Diplow, which it had rather annoyed Sir Hugo to grant, because the excellent hunting in the neighborhood might decide Grandcourt not to part with his chance of future possession;--a man who has two places, in one of which the hunting is less good, naturally desiring a third where it is better.</s> <s sid="44" id="Deronda.c15.s44">Also, Lush had thrown out to Sir Hugo the probability that Grandcourt would woo and win Miss Arrowpoint, and in that case ready money might be less of a temptation to him.</s> <s sid="45" id="Deronda.c15.s45">Hence, on this unexpected meeting at Leubronn, the baronet felt much curiosity to know how things had been going on at Diplow, was bent on being as civil as possible to his nephew, and looked forward to some private chat with Lush.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Deronda.c15.p12"><s sid="46" id="Deronda.c15.s46">Between Deronda and Grandcourt there was a more faintly-marked but peculiar relation, depending on circumstances which have yet to be made known.</s> <s sid="47" id="Deronda.c15.s47">But on no side was there any sign of suppressed chagrin on the first meeting at the _table d'hote_, an hour after Grandcourt's arrival; and when the quartette of gentlemen afterward met on the terrace, without Lady Mallinger, they moved off together to saunter through the rooms, Sir Hugo saying as they entered the large _saal_--</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="Deronda.c15.p20" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="Deronda.c15.s56"><qs/>"The fact is, somebody should invent a mill to do amusements for you, my dear fellow,"<qe/><sss/> said Sir Hugo, <sse/><qs/>"as the Tartars get their praying done.</s> <s sid="57" id="Deronda.c15.s57">But I agree with you; I never cared for play.</s> <s sid="58" id="Deronda.c15.s58">It's monotonous--knits the brain up into meshes.</s> <s sid="59" id="Deronda.c15.s59">And it knocks me up to watch it now.</s> <s sid="60" id="Deronda.c15.s60">I suppose one gets poisoned with the bad air.</s> <s sid="61" id="Deronda.c15.s61">I never stay here more than ten minutes.</s> <s sid="62" id="Deronda.c15.s62">But where's your gambling beauty, Deronda?</s> <s sid="63" id="Deronda.c15.s63">Have you seen her lately?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="Deronda.c15.p23" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="Deronda.c15.s71"><qs/>"Oh, by the Visitor-list,"<qe/> said Deronda, with a scarcely perceptible shrug.</s> <s sid="72" id="Deronda.c15.s72"><qs/>"Vandernoodt told me her name was Harleth, and she was with the Baron and Baroness von Langen.</s> <s sid="73" id="Deronda.c15.s73">I saw by the list that Miss Harleth was no longer there."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="Deronda.c15.p24"><s sid="74" id="Deronda.c15.s74">This held no further information for Lush than that Gwendolen had been gambling.</s> <s sid="75" id="Deronda.c15.s75">He had already looked at the list, and ascertained that Gwendolen had gone, but he had no intention of thrusting this knowledge on Grandcourt before he asked for it; and he had not asked, finding it enough to believe that the object of search would turn up somewhere or other.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="Deronda.c15.p25"><s sid="76" id="Deronda.c15.s76">But now Grandcourt had heard what was rather piquant, and not a word about Miss Harleth had been missed by ham.</s> <s sid="77" id="Deronda.c15.s77">After a moment's pause he said to Deronda--</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="Deronda.c16.p1"><s sid="1" id="Deronda.c16.s1">Men, like planets, have both a visible and an invisible history.</s> <s sid="2" id="Deronda.c16.s2">The astronomer threads the darkness with strict deduction, accounting so for every visible arc in the wanderer's orbit; and the narrator of human actions, if he did his work with the same completeness, would have to thread the hidden pathways of feeling and thought which lead up to every moment of action, and to those moments of intense suffering which take the quality of action--like the cry of Prometheus, whose chained anguish seems a greater energy than the sea and sky he invokes and the deity he defies.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Deronda.c16.p2"><s sid="3" id="Deronda.c16.s3">Deronda's circumstances, indeed, had been exceptional.</s> <s sid="4" id="Deronda.c16.s4">One moment had been burned into his life as its chief epoch--a moment full of July sunshine and large pink roses shedding their last petals on a grassy court enclosed on three sides by a gothic cloister.</s> <s sid="5" id="Deronda.c16.s5">Imagine him in such a scene: a boy of thirteen, stretched prone on the grass where it was in shadow, his curly head propped on his arms over a book, while his tutor, also reading, sat on a camp-stool under shelter.</s> <s sid="6" id="Deronda.c16.s6">Deronda s book was Sismondi's "History of the Italian Republics";--the lad had a passion for history, eager to know how time had been filled up since the flood, and how things were carried on in the dull periods.</s> <s sid="7" id="Deronda.c16.s7">Suddenly he let down his left arm and looked at his tutor, saying in purest boyish tones--</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Deronda.c16.p3" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="Deronda.c16.s8"><qs/>"Mr. Fraser, how was it that the popes and cardinals always had so many nephews?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Deronda.c16.p4"><s sid="9" id="Deronda.c16.s9">The tutor, an able young Scotchman, who acted as Sir Hugo Mallinger's secretary, roused rather unwillingly from his political economy, answered with the clear-cut emphatic chant which makes a truth doubly telling in Scotch utterance--</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Deronda.c16.p5" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="Deronda.c16.s10"><qs/>"Their own children were called nephews."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Deronda.c16.p6" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="Deronda.c16.s11"><qs/>"Why?"<qe/> said Deronda.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Deronda.c16.p7" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="Deronda.c16.s12"><qs/>"It was just for the propriety of the thing; because, as you know very well, priests don't marry, and the children were illegitimate."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Deronda.c16.p8"><s sid="13" id="Deronda.c16.s13">Mr. Fraser, thrusting out his lower lip and making his chant of the last word the more emphatic for a little impatience at being interrupted, had already turned his eyes on his book again, while Deronda, as if something had stung him, started up in a sitting attitude with his back to the tutor.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Deronda.c16.p9" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="Deronda.c16.s14">He had always called Sir Hugo Mallinger his uncle, and when it once occurred to him to ask about his father and mother, the baronet had answered, <qs/>"You lost your father and mother when you were quite a little one; that is why I take care of you."<qe/></s> <s sid="15" id="Deronda.c16.s15">Daniel then straining to discern something in that early twilight, had a dim sense of having been kissed very much, and surrounded by thin, cloudy, scented drapery, till his ringers caught in something hard, which hurt him, and he began to cry.</s> <s sid="16" id="Deronda.c16.s16">Every other memory he had was of the little world in which he still lived.</s> <s sid="17" id="Deronda.c16.s17">And at that time he did not mind about learning more, for he was too fond of Sir Hugo to be sorry for the loss of unknown parents.</s> <s sid="18" id="Deronda.c16.s18">Life was very delightful to the lad, with an uncle who was always indulgent and cheerful--a fine man in the bright noon of life, whom Daniel thought absolutely perfect, and whose place was one of the finest in England, at once historical; romantic, and home-like: a picturesque architectural outgrowth from an abbey, which had still remnants of the old monastic trunk.</s> <s sid="19" id="Deronda.c16.s19">Diplow lay in another county, and was a comparatively landless place which had come into the family from a rich lawyer on the female side who wore the perruque of the restoration; whereas the Mallingers had the grant of Monk's Topping under Henry the Eighth, and ages before had held the neighboring lands of King's Topping, tracing indeed their origin to a certain Hugues le Malingre, who came in with the Conqueror--and also apparently with a sickly complexion which had been happily corrected in his descendants.</s> <s sid="20" id="Deronda.c16.s20">Two rows of these descendants, direct and collateral, females of the male line, and males of the female, looked down in the gallery over the cloisters on the nephew Daniel as he walked there: men in armor with pointed beards and arched eyebrows, pinched ladies in hoops and ruffs with no face to speak of; grave-looking men in black velvet and stuffed hips, and fair, frightened women holding little boys by the hand; smiling politicians in magnificent perruques, and ladies of the prize- animal kind, with rosebud mouths and full eyelids, according to Lely; then a generation whose faces were revised and embellished in the taste of Kneller; and so on through refined editions of the family types in the time of Reynolds and Romney, till the line ended with Sir Hugo and his younger brother Henleigh.</s> <s sid="21" id="Deronda.c16.s21">This last had married Miss Grandcourt, and taken her name along with her estates, thus making a junction between two equally old families, impaling the three Saracens' heads proper and three bezants of the one with the tower and falcons _argent_ of the other, and, as it happened, uniting their highest advantages in the prospects of that Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt who is at present more of an acquaintance to us than either Sir Hugo or his nephew Daniel Deronda.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Deronda.c16.p10"><s sid="22" id="Deronda.c16.s22">In Sir Hugo's youthful portrait with rolled collar and high cravat, Sir Thomas Lawrence had done justice to the agreeable alacrity of expression and sanguine temperament still to be seen in the original, but had done something more than justice in slightly lengthening the nose, which was in reality shorter than might have been expected in a Mallinger.</s> <s sid="23" id="Deronda.c16.s23">Happily the appropriate nose of the family reappeared in his younger brother, and was to be seen in all its refined regularity in his nephew Mallinger Grandcourt.</s> <s sid="24" id="Deronda.c16.s24">But in the nephew Daniel Deronda the family faces of various types, seen on the walls of the gallery; found no reflex.</s> <s sid="25" id="Deronda.c16.s25">Still he was handsomer than any of them, and when he was thirteen might have served as model for any painter who wanted to image the most memorable of boys: you could hardly have seen his face thoroughly meeting yours without believing that human creatures had done nobly in times past, and might do more nobly in time to come.</s> <s sid="26" id="Deronda.c16.s26">The finest childlike faces have this consecrating power, and make us shudder anew at all the grossness and basely-wrought griefs of the world, lest they should enter here and defile.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Deronda.c16.p11"><s sid="27" id="Deronda.c16.s27">But at this moment on the grass among the rose-petals, Daniel Deronda was making a first acquaintance with those griefs.</s> <s sid="28" id="Deronda.c16.s28">A new idea had entered his mind, and was beginning to change the aspect of his habitual feelings as happy careless voyagers are changed with the sky suddenly threatened and the thought of danger arises.</s> <s sid="29" id="Deronda.c16.s29">He sat perfectly still with his back to the tutor, while his face expressed rapid inward transition.</s> <s sid="30" id="Deronda.c16.s30">The deep blush, which had come when he first started up, gradually subsided; but his features kept that indescribable look of subdued activity which often accompanies a new mental survey of familiar facts.</s> <s sid="31" id="Deronda.c16.s31">He had not lived with other boys, and his mind showed the same blending of child's ignorance with surprising knowledge which is oftener seen in bright girls.</s> <s sid="32" id="Deronda.c16.s32">Having read Shakespeare as well as a great deal of history, he could have talked with the wisdom of a bookish child about men who were born out of wedlock and were held unfortunate in consequence, being under disadvantages which required them to be a sort of heroes if they were to work themselves up to an equal standing with their legally born brothers.</s> <s sid="33" id="Deronda.c16.s33">But he had never brought such knowledge into any association with his own lot, which had been too easy for him ever to think about it--until this moment when there had darted into his mind with the magic of quick comparison, the possibility that here was the secret of his own birth, and that the man whom he called uncle was really his father.</s> <s sid="34" id="Deronda.c16.s34">Some children, even younger than Daniel, have known the first arrival of care, like an ominous irremovable guest in their tender lives, on the discovery that their parents, whom they had imagined able to buy everything, were poor and in hard money troubles.</s> <s sid="35" id="Deronda.c16.s35">Daniel felt the presence of a new guest who seemed to come with an enigmatic veiled face, and to carry dimly-conjectured, dreaded revelations.</s> <s sid="36" id="Deronda.c16.s36">The ardor which he had given to the imaginary world in his books suddenly rushed toward his own history and spent its pictorial energy there, explaining what he knew, representing the unknown.</s> <s sid="37" id="Deronda.c16.s37">The uncle whom he loved very dearly took the aspect of a father who held secrets about him--who had done him a wrong--yes, a wrong: and what had become of his mother, for whom he must have been taken away?--Secrets about which he, Daniel, could never inquire; for to speak or to be spoken to about these new thoughts seemed like falling flakes of fire to his imagination.</s> <s sid="38" id="Deronda.c16.s38">Those who have known an impassioned childhood will understand this dread of utterance about any shame connected with their parents.</s> <s sid="39" id="Deronda.c16.s39">The impetuous advent of new images took possession of him with the force of fact for the first time told, and left him no immediate power for the reflection that he might be trembling at a fiction of his own.</s> <s sid="40" id="Deronda.c16.s40">The terrible sense of collision between a strong rush of feeling and the dread of its betrayal, found relief at length in big slow tears, which fell without restraint until the voice of Mr. Fraser was heard saying:</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Deronda.c16.p12" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="Deronda.c16.s41"><qs/>"Daniel, do you see that you are sitting on the bent pages of your book?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="Deronda.c16.p13"><s sid="42" id="Deronda.c16.s42">Daniel immediately moved the book without turning round, and after holding it before him for an instant, rose with it and walked away into the open grounds, where he could dry his tears unobserved.</s> <s sid="43" id="Deronda.c16.s43">The first shock of suggestion past, he could remember that he had no certainty how things really had been, and that he had been making conjectures about his own history, as he had often made stories about Pericles or Columbus, just to fill up the blanks before they became famous.</s> <s sid="44" id="Deronda.c16.s44">Only there came back certain facts which had an obstinate reality,--almost like the fragments of a bridge, telling you unmistakably how the arches lay.</s> <s sid="45" id="Deronda.c16.s45">And again there came a mood in which his conjectures seemed like a doubt of religion, to be banished as an offense, and a mean prying after what he was not meant to know; for there was hardly a delicacy of feeling this lad was not capable of.</s> <s sid="46" id="Deronda.c16.s46">But the summing-up of all his fluctuating experience at this epoch was, that a secret impression had come to him which had given him something like a new sense in relation to all the elements of his life.</s> <s sid="47" id="Deronda.c16.s47">And the idea that others probably knew things concerning which they did not choose to mention, set up in him a premature reserve which helped to intensify his inward experience.</s> <s sid="48" id="Deronda.c16.s48">His ears open now to words which before that July day would have passed by him unnoted; and round every trivial incident which imagination could connect with his suspicions, a newly- roused set of feelings were ready to cluster themselves.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Deronda.c16.p14"><s sid="49" id="Deronda.c16.s49">One such incident a month later wrought itself deeply into his life.</s> <s sid="50" id="Deronda.c16.s50">Daniel had not only one of those thrilling boy voices which seem to bring an idyllic heaven and earth before our eyes, but a fine musical instinct, and had early made out accompaniments for himself on the piano, while he sang from memory.</s> <s sid="51" id="Deronda.c16.s51">Since then he had had some teaching, and Sir Hugo, who delighted in the boy, used to ask for his music in the presence of guests.</s> <s sid="52" id="Deronda.c16.s52">One morning after he had been singing "Sweet Echo" before a small party of gentlemen whom the rain had kept in the house, the baronet, passing from a smiling remark to his next neighbor said:</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Deronda.c16.p15" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="Deronda.c16.s53"><qs/>"Come here, Dan!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Deronda.c16.p16"><s sid="54" id="Deronda.c16.s54">The boy came forward with unusual reluctance.</s> <s sid="55" id="Deronda.c16.s55">He wore an embroidered holland blouse which set off the rich coloring of his head and throat, and the resistant gravity about his mouth and eyes as he was being smiled upon, made their beauty the more impressive.</s> <s sid="56" id="Deronda.c16.s56">Every one was admiring him.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Deronda.c16.p17" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="Deronda.c16.s57"><qs/>"What do you say to being a great singer?</s> <s sid="58" id="Deronda.c16.s58">Should you like to be adored by the world and take the house by storm; like Mario and Tamberlik?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="Deronda.c16.p18"><s sid="59" id="Deronda.c16.s59">Daniel reddened instantaneously, but there was a just perceptible interval before he answered with angry decision--</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="Deronda.c16.p19" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="Deronda.c16.s60"><qs/>"No; I should hate it!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="Deronda.c16.p20" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="Deronda.c16.s61"><qs/>"Well, well, well!"<qe/> said Sir Hugo, with surprised kindliness intended to be soothing.</s> <s sid="62" id="Deronda.c16.s62">But Daniel turned away quickly, left the room, and going to his own chamber threw himself on the broad window-sill, which was a favorite retreat of his when he had nothing particular to do.</s> <s sid="63" id="Deronda.c16.s63">Here he could see the rain gradually subsiding with gleams through the parting clouds which lit up a great reach of the park, where the old oaks stood apart from each other, and the bordering wood was pierced with a green glade which met the eastern sky.</s> <s sid="64" id="Deronda.c16.s64">This was a scene which had always been part of his home--part of the dignified ease which had been a matter of course in his life.</s> <s sid="65" id="Deronda.c16.s65">And his ardent clinging nature had appropriated it all with affection.</s> <s sid="66" id="Deronda.c16.s66">He knew a great deal of what it was to be a gentleman by inheritance, and without thinking much about himself--for he was a boy of active perceptions and easily forgot his own existence in that of Robert Bruce--he had never supposed that he could be shut out from such a lot, or have a very different part in the world from that of the uncle who petted him.</s> <s sid="67" id="Deronda.c16.s67">It is possible (though not greatly believed in at present) to be fond of poverty and take it for a bride, to prefer scoured deal, red quarries and whitewash for one's private surroundings, to delight in no splendor but what has open doors for the whole nation, and to glory in having no privileges except such as nature insists on; and noblemen have been known to run away from elaborate ease and the option of idleness, that they might bind themselves for small pay to hard-handed labor.</s> <s sid="68" id="Deronda.c16.s68">But Daniel's tastes were altogether in keeping with his nurture: his disposition was one in which everyday scenes and habits beget not _ennui_ or rebellion, but delight, affection, aptitudes; and now the lad had been stung to the quick by the idea that his uncle--perhaps his father--thought of a career for him which was totally unlike his own, and which he knew very well was not thought of among possible destinations for the sons of English gentlemen.</s> <s sid="69" id="Deronda.c16.s69">He had often stayed in London with Sir Hugo, who to indulge the boy's ear had carried him to the opera to hear the great tenors, so that the image of a singer taking the house by storm was very vivid to him; but now, spite of his musical gift, he set himself bitterly against the notion of being dressed up to sing before all those fine people, who would not care about him except as a wonderful toy.</s> <s sid="70" id="Deronda.c16.s70">That Sir Hugo should have thought of him in that position for a moment, seemed to Daniel an unmistakable proof that there was something about his birth which threw him out from the class of gentlemen to which the baronet belonged.</s> <s sid="71" id="Deronda.c16.s71">Would it ever be mentioned to him?</s> <s sid="72" id="Deronda.c16.s72">Would the time come when his uncle would tell him everything?</s> <s sid="73" id="Deronda.c16.s73">He shrank from the prospect: in his imagination he preferred ignorance.</s> <s sid="74" id="Deronda.c16.s74">If his father had been wicked--Daniel inwardly used strong words, for he was feeling the injury done him as a maimed boy feels the crushed limb which for others is merely reckoned in an average of accidents--if his father had done any wrong, he wished it might never be spoken of to him: it was already a cutting thought that such knowledge might be in other minds.</s> <s sid="75" id="Deronda.c16.s75">Was it in Mr. Fraser's? probably not, else he would not have spoken in that way about the pope's nephews.</s> <s sid="76" id="Deronda.c16.s76">Daniel fancied, as older people do, that every one else's consciousness was as active as his own on a matter which was vital to him.</s> <s sid="77" id="Deronda.c16.s77">Did Turvey the valet know?--and old Mrs. French the housekeeper?--and Banks the bailiff, with whom he had ridden about the farms on his pony?--And now there came back the recollection of a day some years before when he was drinking Mrs. Banks's whey, and Banks said to his wife with a wink and a cunning laugh, <qs/>"He features the mother, eh?"<qe/></s> <s sid="78" id="Deronda.c16.s78">At that time little Daniel had merely thought that Banks made a silly face, as the common farming men often did, laughing at what was not laughable; and he rather resented being winked at and talked of as if he did not understand everything.</s> <s sid="79" id="Deronda.c16.s79">But now that small incident became information: it was to be reasoned on.</s> <s sid="80" id="Deronda.c16.s80">How could he be like his mother and not like his father?</s> <s sid="81" id="Deronda.c16.s81">His mother must have been a Mallinger, if Sir Hugo were his uncle.</s> <s sid="82" id="Deronda.c16.s82">But no!</s> <s sid="83" id="Deronda.c16.s83">His father might have been Sir Hugo's brother and have changed his name, as Mr. Henleigh Mallinger did when he married Miss Grandcourt.</s> <s sid="84" id="Deronda.c16.s84">But then, why had he never heard Sir Hugo speak of his brother Deronda, as he spoke of his brother Grandcourt?</s> <s sid="85" id="Deronda.c16.s85">Daniel had never before cared about the family tree--only about that ancestor who had killed three Saracens in one encounter.</s> <s sid="86" id="Deronda.c16.s86">But now his mind turned to a cabinet of estate-maps in the library, where he had once seen an illuminated parchment hanging out, that Sir Hugo said was the family tree.</s> <s sid="87" id="Deronda.c16.s87">The phrase was new and odd to him--he was a little fellow then-- hardly mare than half his present age--and he gave it no precise meaning.</s> <s sid="88" id="Deronda.c16.s88">He knew more now and wished that he could examine that parchment.</s> <s sid="89" id="Deronda.c16.s89">He imagined that the cabinet was always locked, and longed to try it.</s> <s sid="90" id="Deronda.c16.s90">But here he checked himself.</s> <s sid="91" id="Deronda.c16.s91">He might be seen: and he would never bring himself near even a silent admission of the sore that had opened in him.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="Deronda.c16.p21" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="Deronda.c16.s92">It is in such experiences of a boy or girlhood, while elders are debating whether most education lies in science or literature, that the main lines of character are often laid down.</s> <s sid="93" id="Deronda.c16.s93">If Daniel had been of a less ardently affectionate nature, the reserve about himself and the supposition that others had something to his disadvantage in their minds, might have turned into a hard, proud antagonism.</s> <s sid="94" id="Deronda.c16.s94">But inborn lovingness was strong enough to keep itself level with resentment.</s> <s sid="95" id="Deronda.c16.s95">There was hardly any creature in his habitual world that he was not fond of; teasing them occasionally, of course--all except his uncle, or <qs/>"Nunc,"<qe/> as Sir Hugo had taught him to say; for the baronet was the reverse of a strait-laced man, and left his dignity to take care of itself.</s> <s sid="96" id="Deronda.c16.s96">Him Daniel loved in that deep-rooted filial way which makes children always the happier for being in the same room with father or mother, though their occupations may be quite apart.</s> <s sid="97" id="Deronda.c16.s97">Sir Hugo's watch-chain and seals, his handwriting, his mode of smoking and of talking to his dogs and horses, had all a rightness and charm about them to the boy which went along with the happiness of morning and breakfast time.</s> <s sid="98" id="Deronda.c16.s98">That Sir Hugo had always been a Whig, made Tories and Radicals equally opponents of the truest and best; and the books he had written were all seen under the same consecration of loving belief which differenced what was his from what was not his, in spite of general resemblance.</s> <s sid="99" id="Deronda.c16.s99">Those writings were various, from volumes of travel in the brilliant style, to articles on things in general, and pamphlets on political crises; but to Daniel they were alike in having an unquestionable rightness by which other people's information could be tested.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="Deronda.c16.p22"><s sid="100" id="Deronda.c16.s100">Who cannot imagine the bitterness of a first suspicion that something in this object of complete love was _not_ quite right?</s> <s sid="101" id="Deronda.c16.s101">Children demand that their heroes should be fleckless, and easily believe them so: perhaps a first discovery to the contrary is hardly a less revolutionary shock to a passionate child than the threatened downfall of habitual beliefs which makes the world seem to totter for us in maturer life.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="Deronda.c16.p23" type="speech"><s sid="102" id="Deronda.c16.s102">But some time after this renewal of Daniel's agitation it appeared that Sir Hugo must have been making a merely playful experiment in his question about the singing.</s> <s sid="103" id="Deronda.c16.s103">He sent for Daniel into the library, and looking up from his writing as the boy entered threw himself sideways in his armchair.</s> <s sid="104" id="Deronda.c16.s104"><qs/>"Ah, Dan!"<qe/> he said kindly, drawing one of the old embroidered stools close to him.</s> <s sid="105" id="Deronda.c16.s105"><qs/>"Come and sit down here."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="Deronda.c16.p24"><s sid="106" id="Deronda.c16.s106">Daniel obeyed, and Sir Hugo put a gentle hand on his shoulder, looking at him affectionately.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="Deronda.c16.p25" type="speech"><s sid="107" id="Deronda.c16.s107"><qs/>"What is it, my boy?</s> <s sid="108" id="Deronda.c16.s108">Have you heard anything that has put you out of spirits lately?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="Deronda.c16.p26"><s sid="109" id="Deronda.c16.s109">Daniel was determined not to let the tears come, but he could not speak.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="Deronda.c16.p27" type="speech"><s sid="110" id="Deronda.c16.s110"><qs/>"All changes are painful when people have been happy, you know,"<qe/> said Sir Hugo, lifting his hand from the boy's shoulder to his dark curls and rubbing them gently.</s> <s sid="111" id="Deronda.c16.s111"><qs/>"You can't be educated exactly as I wish you to be without our parting.</s> <s sid="112" id="Deronda.c16.s112">And I think you will find a great deal to like at school."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="Deronda.c16.p28"><s sid="113" id="Deronda.c16.s113">This was not what Daniel expected, and was so far a relief, which gave him spirit to answer--</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="Deronda.c16.p29" type="speech"><s sid="114" id="Deronda.c16.s114"><qs/>"Am I to go to school?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="Deronda.c16.p31"><s sid="118" id="Deronda.c16.s118">Daniel's color came went.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="Deronda.c16.p33" type="speech"><s sid="120" id="Deronda.c16.s120"><qs/>"I should like to be a gentleman,"<qe/><sls/> said Daniel, with firm distinctness, <sle/><qs/>"and go to school, if that is what a gentleman's son must do."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="Deronda.c16.p34"><s sid="121" id="Deronda.c16.s121">Sir Hugo watched him silently for a few moments, thinking he understood now why the lad had seemed angry at the notion of becoming a singer.</s> <s sid="122" id="Deronda.c16.s122">Then he said tenderly--</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Deronda.c18.p3" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="Deronda.c18.s3">Mrs. Meyrick's house was not noisy: the front parlor looked on the river, and the back on gardens, so that though she was reading aloud to her daughters, the window could be left open to freshen the air of the small double room where a lamp and two candles were burning.</s> <s sid="4" id="Deronda.c18.s4">The candles were on a table apart for Kate, who was drawing illustrations for a publisher; the lamp was not only for the reader but for Amy and Mab, who were embroidering satin cushions for <qs/>"the great world."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Deronda.c18.p4"><s sid="5" id="Deronda.c18.s5">Outside, the house looked very narrow and shabby, the bright light through the holland blind showing the heavy old-fashioned window-frame; but it is pleasant to know that many such grim-walled slices of space in our foggy London have been and still are the homes of a culture the more spotlessly free from vulgarity, because poverty has rendered everything like display an impersonal question, and all the grand shows of the world simply a spectacle which rouses petty rivalry or vain effort after possession.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Deronda.c18.p5"><s sid="6" id="Deronda.c18.s6">The Meyricks' was a home of that kind: and they all clung to this particular house in a row because its interior was filled with objects always in the same places, which, for the mother held memories of her marriage time, and for the young ones seemed as necessary and uncriticised a part of their world as the stars of the Great Bear seen from the back windows.</s> <s sid="7" id="Deronda.c18.s7">Mrs. Meyrick had borne much stint of other matters that she might be able to keep some engravings specially cherished by her husband; and the narrow spaces of wall held a world history in scenes and heads which the children had early learned by heart.</s> <s sid="8" id="Deronda.c18.s8">The chairs and tables were also old friends preferred to new.</s> <s sid="9" id="Deronda.c18.s9">But in these two little parlors with no furniture that a broker would have cared to cheapen except the prints and piano, there was space and apparatus for a wide-glancing, nicely-select life, opened to the highest things in music, painting and poetry.</s> <s sid="10" id="Deronda.c18.s10">I am not sure that in the times of greatest scarcity, before Kate could get paid- work, these ladies had always had a servant to light their fires and sweep their rooms; yet they were fastidious in some points, and could not believe that the manners of ladies in the fashionable world were so full of coarse selfishness, petty quarreling, and slang as they are represented to be in what are called literary photographs.</s> <s sid="11" id="Deronda.c18.s11">The Meyricks had their little oddities, streaks of eccentricity from the mother's blood as well as the father's, their minds being like mediaeval houses with unexpected recesses and openings from this into that, flights of steps and sudden outlooks.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Deronda.c19.p2"><s sid="3" id="Deronda.c19.s3">To say that Deronda was romantic would be to misrepresent him; but under his calm and somewhat self-repressed exterior there was a fervor which made him easily find poetry and romance among the events of every-day life.</s> <s sid="4" id="Deronda.c19.s4">And perhaps poetry and romance are as plentiful as ever in the world except for those phlegmatic natures who I suspect would in any age have regarded them as a dull form of erroneous thinking.</s> <s sid="5" id="Deronda.c19.s5">They exist very easily in the same room with the microscope and even in railway carriages: what banishes them in the vacuum in gentlemen and lady passengers.</s> <s sid="6" id="Deronda.c19.s6">How should all the apparatus of heaven and earth, from the farthest firmament to the tender bosom of the mother who nourished us, make poetry for a mind that had no movements of awe and tenderness, no sense of fellowship which thrills from the near to the distant, and back again from the distant to the near?</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Deronda.c19.p3"><s sid="7" id="Deronda.c19.s7">To Deronda this event of finding Mirah was as heart-stirring as anything that befell Orestes or Rinaldo.</s> <s sid="8" id="Deronda.c19.s8">He sat up half the night, living again through the moments since he had first discerned Mirah on the river-brink, with the fresh and fresh vividness which belongs to emotive memory.</s> <s sid="9" id="Deronda.c19.s9">When he took up a book to try and dull this urgency of inward vision, the printed words were no more than a network through which he saw and heard everything as clearly as before--saw not only the actual events of two hours, but possibilities of what had been and what might be which those events were enough to feed with the warm blood of passionate hope and fear.</s> <s sid="10" id="Deronda.c19.s10">Something in his own experience caused Mirah's search after her mother to lay hold with peculiar force on his imagination.</s> <s sid="11" id="Deronda.c19.s11">The first prompting of sympathy was to aid her in her search: if given persons were extant in London there were ways of finding them, as subtle as scientific experiment, the right machinery being set at work.</s> <s sid="12" id="Deronda.c19.s12">But here the mixed feelings which belonged to Deronda's kindred experience naturally transfused themselves into his anxiety on behalf of Mirah.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Deronda.c19.p4"><s sid="13" id="Deronda.c19.s13">The desire to know his own mother, or to know about her, was constantly haunted with dread; and in imagining what might befall Mirah it quickly occurred to him that finding the mother and brother from whom she had been parted when she was a little one might turn out to be a calamity.</s> <s sid="14" id="Deronda.c19.s14">When she was in the boat she said that her mother and brother were good; but the goodness might have been chiefly in her own ignorant innocence and yearning memory, and the ten or twelve years since the parting had been time enough for much worsening.</s> <s sid="15" id="Deronda.c19.s15">Spite of his strong tendency to side with the objects of prejudice, and in general with those who got the worst of it, his interest had never been practically drawn toward existing Jews, and the facts he knew about them, whether they walked conspicuous in fine apparel or lurked in by-streets, were chiefly of a sort most repugnant to him.</s> <s sid="16" id="Deronda.c19.s16">Of learned and accomplished Jews he took it for granted that they had dropped their religion, and wished to be merged in the people of their native lands.</s> <s sid="17" id="Deronda.c19.s17">Scorn flung at a Jew as such would have roused all his sympathy in griefs of inheritance; but the indiscriminate scorn of a race will often strike a specimen who has well earned it on his own account, and might fairly be gibbeted as a rascally son of Adam.</s> <s sid="18" id="Deronda.c19.s18">It appears that the Caribs, who know little of theology, regard thieving as a practice peculiarly connected with Christian tenets, and probably they could allege experimental grounds for this opinion.</s> <s sid="19" id="Deronda.c19.s19">Deronda could not escape (who can?) knowing ugly stories of Jewish characteristics and occupations; and though one of his favorite protests was against the severance of past and present history, he was like others who shared his protest, in never having cared to reach any more special conclusions about actual Jews than that they retained the virtues and vices of a long-oppressed race.</s> <s sid="20" id="Deronda.c19.s20">But now that Mirah's longing roused his mind to a closer survey of details, very disagreeable images urged themselves of what it might be to find out this middle-aged Jewess and her son.</s> <s sid="21" id="Deronda.c19.s21">To be sure, there was the exquisite refinement and charm of the creature herself to make a presumption in favor of her immediate kindred, but--he must wait to know more: perhaps through Mrs. Meyrick he might gather some guiding hints from Mirah's own lips.</s> <s sid="22" id="Deronda.c19.s22">Her voice, her accent, her looks--all the sweet purity that clothed her as with a consecrating garment made him shrink the more from giving her, either ideally or practically, an association with what was hateful or contaminating.</s> <s sid="23" id="Deronda.c19.s23">But these fine words with which we fumigate and becloud unpleasant facts are not the language in which we think.</s> <s sid="24" id="Deronda.c19.s24">Deronda's thinking went on in rapid images of what might be: he saw himself guided by some official scout into a dingy street; he entered through a dim doorway, and saw a hawk-eyed woman, rough-headed, and unwashed, cheapening a hungry girl's last bit of finery; or in some quarter only the more hideous for being smarter, he found himself under the breath of a young Jew talkative and familiar, willing to show his acquaintance with gentlemen's tastes, and not fastidious in any transactions with which they would favor him--and so on through the brief chapter of his experience in this kind.</s> <s sid="25" id="Deronda.c19.s25">Excuse him: his mind was not apt to run spontaneously into insulting ideas, or to practice a form of wit which identifies Moses with the advertisement sheet; but he was just now governed by dread, and if Mirah's parents had been Christian, the chief difference would have been that his forebodings would have been fed with wider knowledge.</s> <s sid="26" id="Deronda.c19.s26">It was the habit of his mind to connect dread with unknown parentage, and in this case as well as his own there was enough to make the connection reasonable.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Deronda.c19.p5"><s sid="27" id="Deronda.c19.s27">But what was to be done with Mirah?</s> <s sid="28" id="Deronda.c19.s28">She needed shelter and protection in the fullest sense, and all his chivalrous sentiment roused itself to insist that the sooner and the more fully he could engage for her the interest of others besides himself, the better he should fulfill her claims on him.</s> <s sid="29" id="Deronda.c19.s29">He had no right to provide for her entirely, though he might be able to do so; the very depth of the impression she had produced made him desire that she should understand herself to be entirely independent of him; and vague visions of the future which he tried to dispel as fantastic left their influence in an anxiety stronger than any motive he could give for it, that those who saw his actions closely should be acquainted from the first with the history of his relation to Mirah.</s> <s sid="30" id="Deronda.c19.s30">He had learned to hate secrecy about the grand ties and obligations of his life--to hate it the more because a strong spell of interwoven sensibilities hindered him from breaking such secrecy.</s> <s sid="31" id="Deronda.c19.s31">Deronda had made a vow to himself that--since the truths which disgrace mortals are not all of their own making--the truth should never be made a disgrace to another by his act.</s> <s sid="32" id="Deronda.c19.s32">He was not without terror lest he should break this vow, and fall into the apologetic philosophy which explains the world into containing nothing better than one's own conduct.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Deronda.c19.p6"><s sid="33" id="Deronda.c19.s33">At one moment he resolved to tell the whole of his adventure to Sir Hugo and Lady Mallinger the next morning at breakfast, but the possibility that something quite new might reveal itself on his next visit to Mrs. Meyrick's checked this impulse, and he finally went to sleep on the conclusion that he would wait until that visit had been made.</s> </p></div>

even as a governess, it appeared she was to be tested and was liable to rejection.</s> <s sid="102" id="Deronda.c24.s102">After she had done herself the violence to accept the bishop and his wife, they were still to consider whether they would accept her; it was at her peril that she was to look, speak, or be silent.</s> <s sid="103" id="Deronda.c24.s103">And even when she had entered on her dismal task of self-constraint in the society of three girls whom she was bound incessantly to edify, the same process of inspection was to go on: there was always to be Mrs. Mompert's supervision; always something or other would be expected of her to which she had not the slightest inclination; and perhaps the bishop would examine her on serious topics.</s> <s sid="104" id="Deronda.c24.s104">Gwendolen, lately used to the social successes of a handsome girl, whose lively venturesomeness of talk has the effect of wit, and who six weeks before would have pitied the dullness of the bishop rather than have been embarrassed by him, saw the life before her as an entrance into a penitentiary.</s> <s sid="105" id="Deronda.c24.s105">Wild thoughts of running away to be an actress, in spite of Klesmer, came to her with the lure of freedom; but his words still hung heavily on her soul; they had alarmed her pride and even her maidenly dignity: dimly she conceived herself getting amongst vulgar people who would treat her with rude familiarity--odious men, whose grins and smirks would not be seen through the strong grating of polite society.</s> <s sid="106" id="Deronda.c24.s106">Gwendolen's daring was not in the least that of the adventuress; the demand to be held a lady was in her very marrow; and when she had dreamed that she might be the heroine of the gaming-table, it was with the understanding that no one should treat her with the less consideration, or presume to look at her with irony as Deronda had done.</s> <s sid="107" id="Deronda.c24.s107">To be protected and petted, and to have her susceptibilities consulted in every detail, had gone along with her food and clothing as matters of course in her life: even without any such warning as Klesmer's she could not have thought it an attractive freedom to be thrown in solitary dependence on the doubtful civility of strangers.</s> <s sid="108" id="Deronda.c24.s108">The endurance of the episcopal penitentiary was less repulsive than that;

but even if Gwendolen's experience had led her to dwell on love-making and marriage as her elysium, her heart was too much oppressed by what was near to her, in both the past and the future, for her to project her anticipations very far off.</s> <s sid="113" id="Deronda.c24.s113">She had a world-nausea upon her, and saw no reason all through her life why she should wish to live.</s> <s sid="114" id="Deronda.c24.s114">No religious view of trouble helped her: her troubles had in her opinion all been caused by other people's disagreeable or wicked conduct; and there was really nothing pleasant to be counted on in the world: that was her feeling; everything else she had heard said about trouble was mere phrase-making not attractive enough for her to have caught it up and repeated it.</s> <s sid="115" id="Deronda.c24.s115">As to the sweetness of labor and fulfilled claims; the interest of inward and outward activity; the impersonal delights of life as a perpetual discovery; the dues of courage, fortitude, industry, which it is mere baseness not to pay toward the common burden;

<title>CHAPTER XXV. How trace the why and wherefore in a mind reduced to the barrenness of a fastidious egoism, in which all direct desires are dulled, and have dwindled from motives into a vacillating expectation of motives: a mind made up of moods, where a fitful impulse springs here and there conspicuously rank amid the general weediness?

<p pid="2" id="Deronda.c30.p2"><s sid="2" id="Deronda.c30.s2">Imagine a rambling, patchy house, the best part built of gray stone, and red-tiled, a round tower jutting at one of the corners, the mellow darkness of its conical roof surmounted by a weather-cock making an agreeable object either amidst the gleams and greenth of summer or the low-hanging clouds and snowy branches of winter: the ground shady with spreading trees: a great tree flourishing on one side, backward some Scotch firs on a broken bank where the roots hung naked, and beyond, a rookery: on the other side a pool overhung with bushes, where the water- fowl fluttered and screamed: all around, a vast meadow which might be called a park, bordered by an old plantation and guarded by stone ledges which looked like little prisons.</s> <s sid="3" id="Deronda.c30.s3">Outside the gate the country, once entirely rural and lovely, now black with coal mines, was chiefly peopled by men and brethren with candles stuck in their hats, and with a diabolic complexion which laid them peculiarly open to suspicion in the eyes of the children at Gadsmere--Mrs. Glasher's four beautiful children, who had dwelt there for about three years.</s> <s sid="4" id="Deronda.c30.s4">Now, in November, when the flower-beds were empty, the trees leafless, and the pool blackly shivering, one might have said that the place was sombrely in keeping with the black roads and black mounds which seemed to put the district in mourning;--except when the children were playing on the gravel with the dogs for their companions.</s> <s sid="5" id="Deronda.c30.s5">But Mrs. Glasher, under her present circumstances, liked Gadsmere as well as she would have liked any other abode.</s> <s sid="6" id="Deronda.c30.s6">The complete seclusion of the place, which the unattractiveness of the country secured, was exactly to her taste.</s> <s sid="7" id="Deronda.c30.s7">When she drove her two ponies with a waggonet full of children, there were no gentry in carriages to be met, only men of business in gigs; at church there were no eyes she cared to avoid, for the curate's wife and the curate himself were either ignorant of anything to her disadvantage, or ignored it: to them she was simply a widow lady, the tenant of Gadsmere; and the name of Grandcourt was of little interest in that district compared with the names of Fletcher and Gawcome, the lessees of the collieries.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Deronda.c30.p3"><s sid="8" id="Deronda.c30.s8">It was full ten years since the elopement of an Irish officer's beautiful wife with young Grandcourt, and a consequent duel where the bullets wounded the air only, had made some little noise.</s> <s sid="9" id="Deronda.c30.s9">Most of those who remembered the affair now wondered what had become of that Mrs. Glasher, whose beauty and brilliancy had made her rather conspicuous to them in foreign places, where she was known to be living with young Grandcourt.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Deronda.c30.p4"><s sid="10" id="Deronda.c30.s10">That he should have disentangled himself from that connection seemed only natural and desirable.</s> <s sid="11" id="Deronda.c30.s11">As to her, it was thought that a woman who was understood to have forsaken her child along with her husband had probably sunk lower.</s> <s sid="12" id="Deronda.c30.s12">Grandcourt had of course got weary of her.</s> <s sid="13" id="Deronda.c30.s13">He was much given to the pursuit of women: but a man in his position would by this time desire to make a suitable marriage with the fair young daughter of a noble house.</s> <s sid="14" id="Deronda.c30.s14">No one talked of Mrs. Glasher now, any more than they talked of the victim in a trial for manslaughter ten years before: she was a lost vessel after whom nobody would send out an expedition of search; but Grandcourt was seen in harbor with his colors flying, registered as seaworthy as ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Deronda.c30.p5"><s sid="15" id="Deronda.c30.s15">Yet, in fact, Grandcourt had never disentangled himself from Mrs. Glasher.</s> <s sid="16" id="Deronda.c30.s16">His passion for her had been the strongest and most lasting he had ever known; and though it was now as dead as the music of a cracked flute, it had left a certain dull disposedness, which, on the death of her husband three years before, had prompted in him a vacillating notion of marrying her, in accordance with the understanding often expressed between them during the days of his first ardor.</s> <s sid="17" id="Deronda.c30.s17">At that early time Grandcourt would willingly have paid for the freedom to be won by a divorce; but the husband would not oblige him, not wanting to be married again himself, and not wishing to have his domestic habits printed in evidence.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Deronda.c30.p6"><s sid="18" id="Deronda.c30.s18">The altered poise which the years had brought in Mrs. Glasher was just the reverse.</s> <s sid="19" id="Deronda.c30.s19">At first she was comparatively careless about the possibility of marriage.</s> <s sid="20" id="Deronda.c30.s20">It was enough that she had escaped from a disagreeable husband and found a sort of bliss with a lover who had completely fascinated her-- young, handsome, amorous, and living in the best style, with equipage and conversation of the kind to be expected in young men of fortune who have seen everything.</s> <s sid="21" id="Deronda.c30.s21">She was an impassioned, vivacious woman, fond of adoration, exasperated by five years of marital rudeness; and the sense of release was so strong upon her that it stilled anxiety for more than she actually enjoyed.</s> <s sid="22" id="Deronda.c30.s22">An equivocal position was of no importance to her then; she had no envy for the honors of a dull, disregarded wife: the one spot which spoiled her vision of her new pleasant world, was the sense that she left her three-year-old boy, who died two years afterward, and whose first tones saying "mamma" retained a difference from those of the children that came after.</s> <s sid="23" id="Deronda.c30.s23">But now the years had brought many changes besides those in the contour of her cheek and throat; and that Grandcourt should marry her had become her dominant desire.</s> <s sid="24" id="Deronda.c30.s24">The equivocal position which she had not minded about for herself was now telling upon her through her children, whom she loved with a devotion charged with the added passion of atonement.</s> <s sid="25" id="Deronda.c30.s25">She had no repentance except in this direction.</s> <s sid="26" id="Deronda.c30.s26">If Grandcourt married her, the children would be none the worse off for what had passed: they would see their mother in a dignified position, and they would be at no disadvantage with the world: her son could be made his father's heir.</s> <s sid="27" id="Deronda.c30.s27">It was the yearning for this result which gave the supreme importance to Grandcourt's feeling for her; her love for him had long resolved itself into anxiety that he should give her the unique, permanent claim of a wife, and she expected no other happiness in marriage than the satisfaction of her maternal love and pride--including her pride for herself in the presence of her children.</s> <s sid="28" id="Deronda.c30.s28">For the sake of that result she was prepared even with a tragic firmness to endure anything quietly in marriage;

and when she was thinking of alternatives for the future it often occurred to her that, even if she did not become Grandcourt's wife, he might never have a son who would have a legitimate claim on him, and the end might be that her son would be made heir to the best part of his estates.</s> <s sid="34" id="Deronda.c30.s34">No son at that early age could promise to have more of his father's physique.</s> <s sid="35" id="Deronda.c30.s35">But her becoming Grandcourt's wife was so far from being an extravagant notion of possibility, that even Lush had entertained it, and had said that he would as soon bet on it as on any other likelihood with regard to his familiar companion.</s> <s sid="36" id="Deronda.c30.s36">Lush, indeed, on inferring that Grandcourt had a preconception of using his residence at Diplow in order to win Miss Arrowpoint, had thought it well to fan that project, taking it as a tacit renunciation of the marriage with Mrs. Glasher, which had long been a mark for the hovering and wheeling of Grandcourt's caprice.</s> <s sid="37" id="Deronda.c30.s37">But both prospects had been negatived by Gwendolen's appearance on the scene;

<p pid="15" id="Deronda.c52.p15"><s sid="98" id="Deronda.c52.s98">With this touch of causticity Deronda got rid of the slight heat at present raised by Hans's naive expansiveness.</s> <s sid="99" id="Deronda.c52.s99">The nonsense about Gwendolen, conveying the fact that she was gone yachting with her husband, only suggested a disturbing sequel to his own strange parting with her.</s> <s sid="100" id="Deronda.c52.s100">But there was one sentence in the letter which raised a more immediate, active anxiety.</s> <s sid="101" id="Deronda.c52.s101">Hans's suspicion of a hidden sadness in Mirah was not in the direction of his wishes, and hence, instead of distrusting his observation here, Deronda began to conceive a cause for the sadness.</s> <s sid="102" id="Deronda.c52.s102">Was it some event that had occurred during his absence, or only the growing fear of some event?</s> <s sid="103" id="Deronda.c52.s103">Was it something, perhaps alterable, in the new position which had been made for her?</s> <s sid="104" id="Deronda.c52.s104">Or--had Mordecai, against his habitual resolve, communicated to her those peculiar cherished hopes about him, Deronda, and had her quickly sensitive nature been hurt by the discovery that her brother's will or tenacity of visionary conviction had acted coercively on their friendship--been hurt by the fear that there was more of pitying self-suppression than of equal regard in Deronda's relation to him?</s> <s sid="105" id="Deronda.c52.s105">For amidst all Mirah's quiet renunciation, the evident thirst of soul with which she received the tribute of equality implied a corresponding pain if she found that what she had taken for a purely reverential regard toward her brother had its mixture of condescension.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Deronda.c52.p16"><s sid="106" id="Deronda.c52.s106">In this last conjecture of Deronda's he was not wrong as to the quality in Mirah's nature on which he was founding--the latent protest against the treatment she had all her life being subject to until she met him.</s> <s sid="107" id="Deronda.c52.s107">For that gratitude which would not let her pass by any notice of their acquaintance without insisting on the depth of her debt to him, took half its fervor from the keen comparison with what others had thought enough to render to her.</s> <s sid="108" id="Deronda.c52.s108">Deronda's affinity in feeling enabled him to penetrate such secrets.</s> <s sid="109" id="Deronda.c52.s109">But he was not near the truth in admitting the idea that Mordecai had broken his characteristic reticence.</s> <s sid="110" id="Deronda.c52.s110">To no soul but Deronda himself had he yet breathed the history of their relation to each other, or his confidence about his friend's origin: it was not only that these subjects were for him too sacred to be spoken of without weighty reason, but that he had discerned Deronda's shrinking at any mention of his birth; and the severity of reserve which had hindered Mordecai from answering a question on a private affair of the Cohen family told yet more strongly here.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="Deronda.c52.p22" type="speech"><s sid="120" id="Deronda.c52.s120"><qs/>"I see no one so great as my brother,"<qe/> she said to Mrs. Meyrick one day that she called at the Chelsea house on her way home, and, according to her hope, found the little mother alone.</s> <s sid="121" id="Deronda.c52.s121"><qs/>"It is difficult to think that he belongs to the same world as those people I used to live amongst.</s> <s sid="122" id="Deronda.c52.s122">I told you once that they made life seem like a madhouse; but when I am with Ezra he makes me feel that his life is a great good, though he has suffered so much; not like me, who wanted to die because I had suffered a little, and only for a little while.</s> <s sid="123" id="Deronda.c52.s123">His soul is so full, it is impossible for him to wish for death as I did.</s> <s sid="124" id="Deronda.c52.s124">I get the same sort of feeling from him that I got yesterday, when I was tired, and came home through the park after the sweet rain had fallen and the sunshine lay on the grass and flowers.</s> <s sid="125" id="Deronda.c52.s125">Everything in the sky and under the sky looked so pure and beautiful that the weariness and trouble and folly seemed only a small part of what is, and I became more patient and hopeful."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Deronda.c54.p14"><s sid="49" id="Deronda.c54.s49">Grandcourt had intense satisfaction in leading his wife captive after this fashion; it gave their life on a small scale a royal representation and publicity in which every thing familiar was got rid of, and every body must do what was expected of them whatever might be their private protest --the protest (kept strictly private) adding to the piquancy of despotism.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Deronda.c54.p16"><s sid="59" id="Deronda.c54.s59">The embitterment of hatred is often as unaccountable to onlookers as the growth of devoted love, and it not only seems but is really out of direct relation with any outward causes to be alleged.</s> <s sid="60" id="Deronda.c54.s60">Passion is of the nature of seed, and finds nourishment within, tending to a predominance which determines all currents toward itself, and makes the whole life its tributary.</s> <s sid="61" id="Deronda.c54.s61">And the intensest form of hatred is that rooted in fear, which compels to silence and drives vehemence into a constructive vindictiveness, an imaginary annihilation of the detested object, something like the hidden rites of vengeance with which the persecuted have made a dark vent for their rage, and soothed their suffering into dumbness.</s> <s sid="62" id="Deronda.c54.s62">Such hidden rites went on in the secrecy of Gwendolen's mind, but not with soothing effect--rather with the effect of a struggling terror.</s> <s sid="63" id="Deronda.c54.s63">Side by side with the dread of her husband had grown the self- dread, which urged her to flee from the pursuing images wrought by her pent-up impulse.</s> <s sid="64" id="Deronda.c54.s64">The vision of her past wrong-doing, and what it had brought on her, came with a pale ghastly illumination over every imagined deed that was a rash effort at freedom, such as she had made in her marriage.</s> <s sid="65" id="Deronda.c54.s65">Moreover, she had learned to see all her acts through the impression they would make on Deronda: whatever relief might come to her, she could not sever it from the judgment of her that would be created in his mind.</s> <s sid="66" id="Deronda.c54.s66">Not one word of flattery, of indulgence, of dependence on her favor, could be fastened on by her in all their intercourse, to weaken his restraining power over her (in this way Deronda's effort over himself was repaid); and amid the dreary uncertainties of her spoiled life the possible remedies that lay in his mind, nay, the remedy that lay in her feeling for him, made her only hope.</s> <s sid="67" id="Deronda.c54.s67">He seemed to her a terrible-browed angel, from whom she could not think of concealing any deed so as to win an ignorant regard from him: it belonged to the nature of their relation that she should be truthful, for his power over her had begun in the raising of a self-discontent which could be satisfied only by genuine change.</s> <s sid="68" id="Deronda.c54.s68">But in no concealment had she now any confidence: her vision of what she had to dread took more decidedly than ever the form of some fiercely impulsive deed, committed as in a dream that she would instantaneously wake from to find the effects real though the images had been false: to find death under her hands, but instead of darkness, daylight; instead of satisfied hatred, the dismay of guilt; instead of freedom, the palsy of a new terror--a white dead face from which she was forever trying to flee and forever held back.</s> <s sid="69" id="Deronda.c54.s69">She remembered Deronda's words: they were continually recurring in her thought--</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Deronda.c55.p3"><s sid="5" id="Deronda.c55.s5">In two hours after his parting from her he knew that the Princess Halm- Eberstein had left the hotel, and so far as the purpose of his journey to Genoa was concerned, he might himself have set off on his way to Mainz, to deliver the letter from Joseph Kalonymos, and get possession of the family chest.</s> <s sid="6" id="Deronda.c55.s6">But mixed mental conditions, which did not resolve themselves into definite reasons, hindered him from departure.</s> <s sid="7" id="Deronda.c55.s7">Long after the farewell he was kept passive by a weight of retrospective feeling.</s> <s sid="8" id="Deronda.c55.s8">He lived again, with the new keenness of emotive memory, through the exciting scenes which seemed past only in the sense of preparation for their actual presence in his soul.</s> <s sid="9" id="Deronda.c55.s9">He allowed himself in his solitude to sob, with perhaps more than a woman's acuteness of compassion, over that woman's life so near to his, and yet so remote.</s> <s sid="10" id="Deronda.c55.s10">He beheld the world changed for him by the certitude of ties that altered the poise of hopes and fears, and gave him a new sense of fellowship, as if under cover of the night he had joined the wrong band of wanderers, and found with the rise of morning that the tents of his kindred were grouped far off.</s> <s sid="11" id="Deronda.c55.s11">He had a quivering imaginative sense of close relation to the grandfather who had been animated by strong impulses and beloved thoughts, which were now perhaps being roused from their slumber within himself.</s> <s sid="12" id="Deronda.c55.s12">And through all this passionate meditation Mordecai and Mirah were always present, as beings who clasped hands with him in sympathetic silence.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Deronda.c55.p4"><s sid="13" id="Deronda.c55.s13">Of such quick, responsive fibre was Deronda made, under that mantle of self-controlled reserve into which early experience had thrown so much of his young strength.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Deronda.c55.p5" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="Deronda.c55.s14">When the persistent ringing of a bell as a signal reminded him of the hour he thought of looking into _Bradshaw_, and making the brief necessary preparations for starting by the next train--thought of it, but made no movement in consequence.</s> <s sid="15" id="Deronda.c55.s15">Wishes went to Mainz and what he was to get possession of there--to London and the beings there who made the strongest attachments of his life; but there were other wishes that clung in these moments to Genoa, and they kept him where he was by that force which urges us to linger over an interview that carries a presentiment of final farewell or of overshadowing sorrow.</s> <s sid="16" id="Deronda.c55.s16">Deronda did not formally say, <qs/>"I will stay over to-night, because it is Friday, and I should like to go to the evening service at the synagogue where they must all have gone; and besides, I may see the Grandcourts again."<qe/></s> <s sid="17" id="Deronda.c55.s17">But simply, instead of packing and ringing for his bill, he sat doing nothing at all, while his mind went to the synagogue and saw faces there probably little different from those of his grandfather's time, and heard the Spanish-Hebrew liturgy which had lasted through the seasons of wandering generations like a plant with wandering seed, that gives the far-off lands a kinship to the exile's home--while, also, his mind went toward Gwendolen, with anxious remembrance of what had been, and with a half-admitted impression that it would be hardness in him willingly to go away at once without making some effort, in spite of Grandcourt's probable dislike, to manifest the continuance of his sympathy with her since their abrupt parting.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Deronda.c55.p6"><s sid="18" id="Deronda.c55.s18">In this state of mind he deferred departure, ate his dinner without sense of flavor, rose from it quickly to find the synagogue, and in passing the porter asked if Mr. and Mrs. Grandcourt were still in the hotel, and what was the number of their apartment.</s> <s sid="19" id="Deronda.c55.s19">The porter gave him the number, but added that they were gone out boating.</s> <s sid="20" id="Deronda.c55.s20">That information had somehow power enough over Deronda to divide his thoughts with the memories wakened among the sparse _talithim_ and keen dark faces of worshippers whose way of taking awful prayers and invocations with the easy familiarity which might be called Hebrew dyed Italian, made him reflect that his grandfather, according to the Princess's hints of his character, must have been almost as exceptional a Jew as Mordecai.</s> <s sid="21" id="Deronda.c55.s21">But were not men of ardent zeal and far- reaching hope everywhere exceptional? the men who had the visions which, as Mordecai said, were the creators and feeders of the world--moulding and feeding the more passive life which without them would dwindle and shrivel into the narrow tenacity of insects, unshaken by thoughts beyond the reach of their antennae.</s> <s sid="22" id="Deronda.c55.s22">Something of a mournful impatience perhaps added itself to the solicitude about Gwendolen (a solicitude that had room to grow in his present release from immediate cares) as an incitement to hasten from the synagogue and choose to take his evening walk toward the quay, always a favorite haunt with him, and just now attractive with the possibility that he might be in time to see the Grandcourts come in from their boating.</s> <s sid="23" id="Deronda.c55.s23">In this case, he resolved that he would advance to greet them deliberately, and ignore any grounds that the husband might have for wishing him elsewhere.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Deronda.c55.p7"><s sid="24" id="Deronda.c55.s24">The sun had set behind a bank of cloud, and only a faint yellow light was giving its farewell kisses to the waves, which were agitated by an active breeze.</s> <s sid="25" id="Deronda.c55.s25">Deronda, sauntering slowly within sight of what took place on the strand, observed the groups there concentrating their attention on a sailing-boat which was advancing swiftly landward, being rowed by two men.</s> <s sid="26" id="Deronda.c55.s26">Amidst the clamorous talk in various languages, Deronda held it the surer means of getting information not to ask questions, but to elbow his way to the foreground and be an unobstructed witness of what was occurring.</s> <s sid="27" id="Deronda.c55.s27">Telescopes were being used, and loud statements made that the boat held somebody who had been drowned.</s> <s sid="28" id="Deronda.c55.s28">One said it was the _milord_ who had gone out in a sailing boat; another maintained that the prostrate figure he discerned was _miladi_; a Frenchman who had no glass would rather say that it was _milord_ who had probably taken his wife out to drown her, according to the national practice--a remark which an English skipper immediately commented on in our native idiom (as nonsense which--had undergone a mining operation), and further dismissed by the decision that the reclining figure was a woman.</s> <s sid="29" id="Deronda.c55.s29">For Deronda, terribly excited by fluctuating fears, the strokes of the oars as he watched them were divided by swift visions of events, possible and impossible, which might have brought about this issue, or this broken-off fragment of an issue, with a worse half undisclosed--if this woman apparently snatched from the waters were really Mrs. Grandcourt.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Deronda.c55.p8"><s sid="30" id="Deronda.c55.s30">But soon there was no longer any doubt: the boat was being pulled to land, and he saw Gwendolen half raising herself on her hands, by her own effort, under her heavy covering of tarpaulin and pea-jackets--pale as one of the sheeted dead, shivering, with wet hair streaming, a wild amazed consciousness in her eyes, as if she had waked up in a world where some judgment was impending, and the beings she saw around were coming to seize her.</s> <s sid="31" id="Deronda.c55.s31">The first rower who jumped to land was also wet through, and ran off; the sailors, close about the boat, hindered Deronda from advancing, and he could only look on while Gwendolen gave sacred glances, and seemed to shrink with terror as she was carefully, tenderly helped out, and led on by the strong arms of those rough, bronzed men, her wet clothes clinging about her limbs, and adding to the impediment of her weakness.</s> <s sid="32" id="Deronda.c55.s32">Suddenly her wandering eyes fell on Deronda, standing before her, and immediately, as if she had been expecting him and looking for him, she tried to stretch out her arms, which were held back by her supporters, saying, in a muffled voice--</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Deronda.c55.p11"><s sid="38" id="Deronda.c55.s38">He stayed behind to hear from the remaining boatman that her husband had gone down irrecoverably, and that his boat was left floating empty.</s> <s sid="39" id="Deronda.c55.s39">He and his comrade had heard a cry, had come up in time to see the lady jump in after her husband, and had got her out fast enough to save her from much damage.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Deronda.c55.p12"><s sid="40" id="Deronda.c55.s40">After this, Deronda hastened to the hotel to assure himself that the best medical help would be provided; and being satisfied on this point, he telegraphed the event to Sir Hugo, begging him to come forthwith, and also to Mr. Gascoigne, whose address at the rectory made his nearest known way of getting the information to Gwendolen's mother.</s> <s sid="41" id="Deronda.c55.s41">Certain words of Gwendolen's in the past had come back to him with the effectiveness of an inspiration: in moments of agitated confession she had spoken of her mother's presence, as a possible help, if she could have had it.</s> </p></div>
