<title>Chapter I Outside Dorlcote Mill</title>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="mill.c1.s1">A wide plain, where the broadening Floss hurries on between its green banks to the sea, and the loving tide, rushing to meet it, checks its passage with an impetuous embrace.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c1.s2">On this mighty tide the black ships--laden with the fresh-scented fir-planks, with rounded sacks of oil-bearing seed, or with the dark glitter of coal--are borne along to the town of St.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c1.s3">Ogg's, which shows its aged, fluted red roofs and the broad gables of its wharves between the low wooded hill and the river-brink, tingeing the water with a soft purple hue under the transient glance of this February sun.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c1.s4">Far away on each hand stretch the rich pastures, and the patches of dark earth made ready for the seed of broad-leaved green crops, or touched already with the tint of the tender-bladed autumn-sown corn.</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c1.s5">There is a remnant still of last year's golden clusters of beehive-ricks rising at intervals beyond the hedgerows; and everywhere the hedgerows are studded with trees; the distant ships seem to be lifting their masts and stretching their red-brown sails close among the branches of the spreading ash.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c1.s6">Just by the red-roofed town the tributary Ripple flows with a lively current into the Floss.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c1.s7">How lovely the little river is, with its dark changing wavelets!</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c1.s8">It seems to me like a living companion while I wander along the bank, and listen to its low, placid voice, as to the voice of one who is deaf and loving.</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c1.s9">I remember those large dipping willows.</s> <s sid="10" id="mill.c1.s10">I remember the stone bridge.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c1.p2"><s sid="11" id="mill.c1.s11">And this is Dorlcote Mill.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c1.s12">I must stand a minute or two here on the bridge and look at it, though the clouds are threatening, and it is far on in the afternoon.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c1.s13">Even in this leafless time of departing February it is pleasant to look at,--perhaps the chill, damp season adds a charm to the trimly kept, comfortable dwelling-house, as old as the elms and chestnuts that shelter it from the northern blast.</s> <s sid="14" id="mill.c1.s14">The stream is brimful now, and lies high in this little withy plantation, and half drowns the grassy fringe of the croft in front of the house.</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c1.s15">As I look at the full stream, the vivid grass, the delicate bright-green powder softening the outline of the great trunks and branches that gleam from under the bare purple boughs, I am in love with moistness, and envy the white ducks that are dipping their heads far into the water here among the withes, unmindful of the awkward appearance they make in the drier world above.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c1.p3"><s sid="16" id="mill.c1.s16">The rush of the water and the booming of the mill bring a dreamy deafness, which seems to heighten the peacefulness of the scene.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c1.s17">They are like a great curtain of sound, shutting one out from the world beyond.</s> <s sid="18" id="mill.c1.s18">And now there is the thunder of the huge covered wagon coming home with sacks of grain.</s> <s sid="19" id="mill.c1.s19">That honest wagoner is thinking of his dinner, getting sadly dry in the oven at this late hour; but he will not touch it till he has fed his horses,--the strong, submissive, meek-eyed beasts, who, I fancy, are looking mild reproach at him from between their blinkers, that he should crack his whip at them in that awful manner as if they needed that hint!</s> <s sid="20" id="mill.c1.s20">See how they stretch their shoulders up the slope toward the bridge, with all the more energy because they are so near home.</s> <s sid="21" id="mill.c1.s21">Look at their grand shaggy feet that seem to grasp the firm earth, at the patient strength of their necks, bowed under the heavy collar, at the mighty muscles of their struggling haunches!</s> <s sid="22" id="mill.c1.s22">I should like well to hear them neigh over their hardly earned feed of corn, and see them, with their moist necks freed from the harness, dipping their eager nostrils into the muddy pond.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c1.s23">Now they are on the bridge, and down they go again at a swifter pace, and the arch of the covered wagon disappears at the turning behind the trees.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c1.p4"><s sid="24" id="mill.c1.s24">Now I can turn my eyes toward the mill again, and watch the unresting wheel sending out its diamond jets of water.</s> <s sid="25" id="mill.c1.s25">That little girl is watching it too; she has been standing on just the same spot at the edge of the water ever since I paused on the bridge.</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c1.s26">And that queer white cur with the brown ear seems to be leaping and barking in ineffectual remonstrance with the wheel; perhaps he is jealous because his playfellow in the beaver bonnet is so rapt in its movement.</s> <s sid="27" id="mill.c1.s27">It is time the little playfellow went in, I think; and there is a very bright fire to tempt her: the red light shines out under the deepening gray of the sky.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c1.p5"><s sid="28" id="mill.c1.s28">Ah, my arms are really benumbed.</s> <s sid="29" id="mill.c1.s29">I have been pressing my elbows on the arms of my chair, and dreaming that I was standing on the bridge in front of Dorlcote Mill, as it looked one February afternoon many years ago.</s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c1.s30">Before I dozed off, I was going to tell you what Mr. and Mrs. Tulliver were talking about, as they sat by the bright fire in the left-hand parlor, on that very afternoon I have been dreaming of.</s> </p></div>

<title>Chapter II Mr. Tulliver, of Dorlcote Mill, Declares His Resolution about Tom</title>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c2.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="mill.c2.s1"><qs/>"What I want, you know,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Tulliver,--<sse/><qs/>"what I want is to give Tom a good eddication; an eddication as'll be a bread to him.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c2.s2">That was what I was thinking of when I gave notice for him to leave the academy at Lady-day.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c2.s3">I mean to put him to a downright good school at Midsummer.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c2.s4">The two years at th' academy 'ud ha' done well enough, if I'd meant to make a miller and farmer of him, for he's had a fine sight more schoolin' nor _I_ ever got.</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c2.s5">All the learnin' _my_ father ever paid for was a bit o' birch at one end and the alphabet at th' other.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c2.s6">But I should like Tom to be a bit of a scholard, so as he might be up to the tricks o' these fellows as talk fine and write with a flourish.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c2.s7">It 'ud be a help to me wi' these lawsuits, and arbitrations, and things.</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c2.s8">I wouldn't make a downright lawyer o' the lad,--I should be sorry for him to be a raskill,--but a sort o' engineer, or a surveyor, or an auctioneer and vallyer, like Riley, or one o' them smartish businesses as are all profits and no outlay, only for a big watch-chain and a high stool.</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c2.s9">They're pretty nigh all one, and they're not far off being even wi' the law, _I_ believe; for Riley looks Lawyer Wakem i' the face as hard as one cat looks another.</s> <s sid="10" id="mill.c2.s10">_He's_ none frightened at him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c2.p2"><s sid="11" id="mill.c2.s11">Mr. Tulliver was speaking to his wife, a blond comely woman in a fan-shaped cap (I am afraid to think how long it is since fan-shaped caps were worn, they must be so near coming in again.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c2.s12">At that time, when Mrs. Tulliver was nearly forty, they were new at St.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c2.s13">Ogg's, and considered sweet things).</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c2.p3" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="mill.c2.s14"><qs/>"Well, Mr. Tulliver, you know best:</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c2.s15">_I've_ no objections.</s> <s sid="16" id="mill.c2.s16">But hadn't I better kill a couple o' fowl, and have th' aunts and uncles to dinner next week, so as you may hear what sister Glegg and sister Pullet have got to say about it?</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c2.s17">There's a couple o' fowl _wants_ killing!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c2.p4" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="mill.c2.s18"><qs/>"You may kill every fowl i' the yard if you like, Bessy; but I shall ask neither aunt nor uncle what I'm to do wi' my own lad,"<qe/> said Mr. Tulliver, defiantly.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c2.p5" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="mill.c2.s19"><qs/>"Dear heart!"<qe/><sls/> said Mrs. Tulliver, shocked at this sanguinary rhetoric, <sle/><qs/>"how can you talk so, Mr. Tulliver?</s> <s sid="20" id="mill.c2.s20">But it's your way to speak disrespectful o' my family; and sister Glegg throws all the blame upo'me, though I'm sure I'm as innocent as the babe unborn.</s> <s sid="21" id="mill.c2.s21">For nobody's ever heard me say as it wasn't lucky for my children to have aunts and uncles as can live independent.</s> <s sid="22" id="mill.c2.s22">Howiver, if Tom's to go to a new school, I should like him to go where I can wash him and mend him; else he might as well have calico as linen, for they'd be one as yallow as th' other before they'd been washed half-a-dozen times.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c2.s23">And then, when the box is goin' back'ard and forrard, I could send the lad a cake, or a pork-pie, or an apple; for he can do with an extry bit, bless him! whether they stint him at the meals or no.</s> <s sid="24" id="mill.c2.s24">My children can eat as much victuals as most, thank God!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mill.c2.p6" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="mill.c2.s25"><qs/>"Well, well, we won't send him out o' reach o' the carrier's cart, if other things fit in,"<qe/> said Mr. Tulliver.</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c2.s26"><qs/>"But you mustn't put a spoke i' the wheel about the washin,' if we can't get a school near enough.</s> <s sid="27" id="mill.c2.s27">That's the fault I have to find wi' you, Bessy; if you see a stick i' the road, you're allays thinkin' you can't step over it.</s> <s sid="28" id="mill.c2.s28">You'd want me not to hire a good wagoner, 'cause he'd got a mole on his face."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c2.p7" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="mill.c2.s29"><qs/>"Dear heart!"<qe/><sls/> said Mrs. Tulliver, in mild surprise, <sle/><qs/>"when did I iver make objections to a man because he'd got a mole on his face?</s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c2.s30">I'm sure I'm rether fond o' the moles; for my brother, as is dead an' gone, had a mole on his brow.</s> <s sid="31" id="mill.c2.s31">But I can't remember your iver offering to hire a wagoner with a mole, Mr. Tulliver.</s> <s sid="32" id="mill.c2.s32">There was John Gibbs hadn't a mole on his face no more nor you have, an' I was all for having you hire _him_; an' so you did hire him, an' if he hadn't died o' th' inflammation, as we paid Dr. Turnbull for attending him, he'd very like ha' been drivin' the wagon now.</s> <s sid="33" id="mill.c2.s33">He might have a mole somewhere out o' sight, but how was I to know that, Mr. Tulliver?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mill.c2.p8" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="mill.c2.s34"><qs/>"No, no, Bessy; I didn't mean justly the mole; I meant it to stand for summat else; but niver mind--it's puzzling work, talking is.</s> <s sid="35" id="mill.c2.s35">What I'm thinking on, is how to find the right sort o' school to send Tom to, for I might be ta'en in again, as I've been wi' th' academy.</s> <s sid="36" id="mill.c2.s36">I'll have nothing to do wi' a 'cademy again: whativer school I send Tom to, it sha'n't be a 'cademy; it shall be a place where the lads spend their time i' summat else besides blacking the family's shoes, and getting up the potatoes.</s> <s sid="37" id="mill.c2.s37">It's an uncommon puzzling thing to know what school to pick."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c2.p9" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="mill.c2.s38">Mr. Tulliver paused a minute or two, and dived with both hands into his breeches pockets as if he hoped to find some suggestion there.</s> <s sid="39" id="mill.c2.s39">Apparently he was not disappointed, for he presently said, <qs/>"I know what I'll do:</s> <s sid="40" id="mill.c2.s40">I'll talk it over wi' Riley; he's coming to-morrow, t' arbitrate about the dam."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c2.p10" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="mill.c2.s41"><qs/>"Well, Mr. Tulliver, I've put the sheets out for the best bed, and Kezia's got 'em hanging at the fire.</s> <s sid="42" id="mill.c2.s42">They aren't the best sheets, but they're good enough for anybody to sleep in, be he who he will; for as for them best Holland sheets, I should repent buying 'em, only they'll do to lay us out in.</s> <s sid="43" id="mill.c2.s43">An' if you was to die to-morrow, Mr. Tulliver, they're mangled beautiful, an' all ready, an' smell o' lavender as it 'ud be a pleasure to lay 'em out; an' they lie at the left-hand corner o' the big oak linen-chest at the back: not as I should trust anybody to look 'em out but myself."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mill.c2.p11"><s sid="44" id="mill.c2.s44">As Mrs. Tulliver uttered the last sentence, she drew a bright bunch of keys from her pocket, and singled out one, rubbing her thumb and finger up and down it with a placid smile while she looked at the clear fire.</s> <s sid="45" id="mill.c2.s45">If Mr. Tulliver had been a susceptible man in his conjugal relation, he might have supposed that she drew out the key to aid her imagination in anticipating the moment when he would be in a state to justify the production of the best Holland sheets.</s> <s sid="46" id="mill.c2.s46">Happily he was not so; he was only susceptible in respect of his right to water-power; moreover, he had the marital habit of not listening very closely, and since his mention of Mr. Riley, had been apparently occupied in a tactile examination of his woollen stockings.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mill.c2.p12" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="mill.c2.s47"><qs/>"I think I've hit it, Bessy,"<qe/> was his first remark after a short silence.</s> <s sid="48" id="mill.c2.s48"><qs/>"Riley's as likely a man as any to know o' some school; he's had schooling himself, an' goes about to all sorts o' places, arbitratin' and vallyin' and that.</s> <s sid="49" id="mill.c2.s49">And we shall have time to talk it over to-morrow night when the business is done.</s> <s sid="50" id="mill.c2.s50">I want Tom to be such a sort o' man as Riley, you know,--as can talk pretty nigh as well as if it was all wrote out for him, and knows a good lot o' words as don't mean much, so as you can't lay hold of 'em i' law; and a good solid knowledge o' business too."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mill.c2.p13" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="mill.c2.s51"><qs/>"Well,"<qe/><sss/> said Mrs. Tulliver, <sse/><qs/>"so far as talking proper, and knowing everything, and walking with a bend in his back, and setting his hair up, I shouldn't mind the lad being brought up to that.</s> <s sid="52" id="mill.c2.s52">But them fine-talking men from the big towns mostly wear the false shirt-fronts; they wear a frill till it's all a mess, and then hide it with a bib; I know Riley does.</s> <s sid="53" id="mill.c2.s53">And then, if Tom's to go and live at Mudport, like Riley, he'll have a house with a kitchen hardly big enough to turn in, an' niver get a fresh egg for his breakfast, an' sleep up three pair o' stairs,--or four, for what I know,--and be burnt to death before he can get down."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mill.c2.p14" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="mill.c2.s54"><qs/>"No, no,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Tulliver, <sse/><qs/>"I've no thoughts of his going to Mudport:</s> <s sid="55" id="mill.c2.s55">I mean him to set up his office at St.</s> <s sid="56" id="mill.c2.s56">Ogg's, close by us, an' live at home.</s> <s sid="57" id="mill.c2.s57">But,"<qe/><sls/> continued Mr. Tulliver after a pause, <sle/><qs/>"what I'm a bit afraid on is, as Tom hasn't got the right sort o' brains for a smart fellow.</s> <s sid="58" id="mill.c2.s58">I doubt he's a bit slowish.</s> <s sid="59" id="mill.c2.s59">He takes after your family, Bessy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mill.c2.p15" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="mill.c2.s60"><qs/>"Yes, that he does,"<qe/><sls/> said Mrs. Tulliver, accepting the last proposition entirely on its own merits; <sle/><qs/>"he's wonderful for liking a deal o' salt in his broth.</s> <s sid="61" id="mill.c2.s61">That was my brother's way, and my father's before him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mill.c2.p16" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="mill.c2.s62"><qs/>"It seems a bit a pity, though,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Tulliver, <sse/><qs/>"as the lad should take after the mother's side instead o' the little wench.</s> <s sid="63" id="mill.c2.s63">That's the worst on't wi' crossing o' breeds: you can never justly calkilate what'll come on't.</s> <s sid="64" id="mill.c2.s64">The little un takes after my side, now: she's twice as 'cute as Tom.</s> <s sid="65" id="mill.c2.s65">Too <alt-qs/>'cute for a woman, I'm afraid,"<qe/> continued Mr. Tulliver, turning his head dubiously first on one side and then on the other.</s> <s sid="66" id="mill.c2.s66"><qs/>"It's no mischief much while she's a little un; but an over-'<alt-qe/>cute woman's no better nor a long-tailed sheep,--she'll fetch none the bigger price for that."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mill.c2.p17" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="mill.c2.s67"><qs/>"Yes, it _is_ a mischief while she's a little un, Mr. Tulliver, for it runs to naughtiness.</s> <s sid="68" id="mill.c2.s68">How to keep her in a clean pinafore two hours together passes my cunning.</s> <s sid="69" id="mill.c2.s69">An' now you put me i' mind,"<qe/><sls/> continued Mrs. Tulliver, rising and going to the window, <sle/><qs/>"I don't know where she is now, an' it's pretty nigh tea-time.</s> <s sid="70" id="mill.c2.s70">Ah, I thought so,--wanderin' up an' down by the water, like a wild thing:</s> <s sid="71" id="mill.c2.s71">She'll tumble in some day."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mill.c2.p18"><s sid="72" id="mill.c2.s72">Mrs. Tulliver rapped the window sharply, beckoned, and shook her head,--a process which she repeated more than once before she returned to her chair.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mill.c2.p19" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="mill.c2.s73"><qs/>"You talk o' 'cuteness, Mr. Tulliver,"<qe/><sls/> she observed as she sat down, <sle/><qs/>"but I'm sure the child's half an idiot i' some things; for if I send her upstairs to fetch anything, she forgets what she's gone for, an' perhaps 'ull sit down on the floor i' the sunshine an' plait her hair an' sing to herself like a Bedlam creatur', all the while I'm waiting for her downstairs.</s> <s sid="74" id="mill.c2.s74">That niver run i' my family, thank God! no more nor a brown skin as makes her look like a mulatter.</s> <s sid="75" id="mill.c2.s75">I don't like to fly i' the face o' Providence, but it seems hard as I should have but one gell, an' her so comical."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mill.c2.p20" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="mill.c2.s76"><qs/>"Pooh, nonsense!"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Tulliver; <sse/><qs/>"she's a straight, black-eyed wench as anybody need wish to see.</s> <s sid="77" id="mill.c2.s77">I don't know i' what she's behind other folks's children; and she can read almost as well as the parson."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mill.c2.p21" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="mill.c2.s78"><qs/>"But her hair won't curl all I can do with it, and she's so franzy about having it put i' paper, and I've such work as never was to make her stand and have it pinched with th' irons."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mill.c2.p22" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="mill.c2.s79"><qs/>"Cut it off--cut it off short,"<qe/> said the father, rashly.</s> </p>

<title>Chapter III Mr. Riley Gives His Advice Concerning a School for Tom</title>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c3.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="mill.c3.s1">The gentleman in the ample white cravat and shirt-frill, taking his brandy-and-water so pleasantly with his good friend Tulliver, is Mr. Riley, a gentleman with a waxen complexion and fat hands, rather highly educated for an auctioneer and appraiser, but large-hearted enough to show a great deal of _bonhomie_ toward simple country acquaintances of hospitable habits.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c3.s2">Mr. Riley spoke of such acquaintances kindly as <qs/>"people of the old school."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c3.p2"><s sid="3" id="mill.c3.s3">The conversation had come to a pause.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c3.s4">Mr. Tulliver, not without a particular reason, had abstained from a seventh recital of the cool retort by which Riley had shown himself too many for Dix, and how Wakem had had his comb cut for once in his life, now the business of the dam had been settled by arbitration, and how there never would have been any dispute at all about the height of water if everybody was what they should be, and Old Harry hadn't made the lawyers.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c3.p3"><s sid="5" id="mill.c3.s5">Mr. Tulliver was, on the whole, a man of safe traditional opinions; but on one or two points he had trusted to his unassisted intellect, and had arrived at several questionable conclusions; amongst the rest, that rats, weevils, and lawyers were created by Old Harry.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c3.s6">Unhappily he had no one to tell him that this was rampant Manichaeism, else he might have seen his error.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c3.s7">But to-day it was clear that the good principle was triumphant: this affair of the water-power had been a tangled business somehow, for all it seemed--look at it one way--as plain as water's water; but, big a puzzle as it was, it hadn't got the better of Riley.</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c3.s8">Mr. Tulliver took his brandy-and-water a little stronger than usual, and, for a man who might be supposed to have a few hundreds lying idle at his banker's, was rather incautiously open in expressing his high estimate of his friend's business talents.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c3.p4"><s sid="9" id="mill.c3.s9">But the dam was a subject of conversation that would keep; it could always be taken up again at the same point, and exactly in the same condition; and there was another subject, as you know, on which Mr. Tulliver was in pressing want of Mr. Riley's advice.</s> <s sid="10" id="mill.c3.s10">This was his particular reason for remaining silent for a short space after his last draught, and rubbing his knees in a meditative manner.</s> <s sid="11" id="mill.c3.s11">He was not a man to make an abrupt transition.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c3.s12">This was a puzzling world, as he often said, and if you drive your wagon in a hurry, you may light on an awkward corner.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c3.s13">Mr. Riley, meanwhile, was not impatient.</s> <s sid="14" id="mill.c3.s14">Why should he be?</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c3.s15">Even Hotspur, one would think, must have been patient in his slippers on a warm hearth, taking copious snuff, and sipping gratuitous brandy-and-water.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c3.p5" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="mill.c3.s16"><qs/>"There's a thing I've got i' my head,"<qe/> said Mr. Tulliver at last, in rather a lower tone than usual, as he turned his head and looked steadfastly at his companion.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c3.p9" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="mill.c3.s23"><qs/>"You see, I want to put him to a new school at Midsummer,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Tulliver; <sse/><qs/>"he's comin' away from the 'cademy at Lady-day, an' I shall let him run loose for a quarter; but after that I want to send him to a downright good school, where they'll make a scholard of him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c3.p10" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="mill.c3.s24"><qs/>"Well,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Riley, <sse/><qs/>"there's no greater advantage you can give him than a good education.</s> <s sid="25" id="mill.c3.s25">Not,"<qe/><sls/> he added, with polite significance,--<sle/><qs/>"not that a man can't be an excellent miller and farmer, and a shrewd, sensible fellow into the bargain, without much help from the schoolmaster."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mill.c3.p11" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="mill.c3.s26"><qs/>"I believe you,"<qe/><sls/> said Mr. Tulliver, winking, and turning his head on one side; <sle/><qs/>"but that's where it is.</s> <s sid="27" id="mill.c3.s27">I don't _mean_ Tom to be a miller and farmer.</s> <s sid="28" id="mill.c3.s28">I see no fun i' that.</s> <s sid="29" id="mill.c3.s29">Why, if I made him a miller an' farmer, he'd be expectin' to take to the mill an' the land, an' a-hinting at me as it was time for me to lay by an' think o' my latter end.</s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c3.s30">Nay, nay, I've seen enough o' that wi' sons.</s> <s sid="31" id="mill.c3.s31">I'll never pull my coat off before I go to bed.</s> <s sid="32" id="mill.c3.s32">I shall give Tom an eddication an' put him to a business, as he may make a nest for himself, an' not want to push me out o' mine.</s> <s sid="33" id="mill.c3.s33">Pretty well if he gets it when I'm dead an' gone.</s> <s sid="34" id="mill.c3.s34">I sha'n't be put off wi' spoon-meat afore I've lost my teeth."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mill.c3.p12" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="mill.c3.s35">This was evidently a point on which Mr. Tulliver felt strongly; and the impetus which had given unusual rapidity and emphasis to his speech showed itself still unexhausted for some minutes afterward in a defiant motion of the head from side to side, and an occasional <qs/>"Nay, nay,"<qe/> like a subsiding growl.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mill.c3.p13"><s sid="36" id="mill.c3.s36">These angry symptoms were keenly observed by Maggie, and cut her to the quick.</s> <s sid="37" id="mill.c3.s37">Tom, it appeared, was supposed capable of turning his father out of doors, and of making the future in some way tragic by his wickedness.</s> <s sid="38" id="mill.c3.s38">This was not to be borne; and Maggie jumped up from her stool, forgetting all about her heavy book, which fell with a bang within the fender, and going up between her father's knees, said, in a half-crying, half-indignant voice,--</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mill.c3.p16" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="mill.c3.s42"><qs/>"What! they mustn't say any harm o' Tom, eh?"<qe/> said Mr. Tulliver, looking at Maggie with a twinkling eye.</s> <s sid="43" id="mill.c3.s43">Then, in a lower voice, turning to Mr. Riley, as though Maggie couldn't hear, <qs/>"She understands what one's talking about so as never was.</s> <s sid="44" id="mill.c3.s44">And you should hear her read,--straight off, as if she knowed it all beforehand.</s> <s sid="45" id="mill.c3.s45">And allays at her book!</s> <s sid="46" id="mill.c3.s46">But it's bad--it's bad,"<qe/> Mr. Tulliver added sadly, checking this blamable exultation.</s> <s sid="47" id="mill.c3.s47"><qs/>"A woman's no business wi' being so clever; it'll turn to trouble, I doubt.</s> <s sid="48" id="mill.c3.s48">But bless you!"<qe/><sls/>--here the exultation was clearly recovering the mastery,--<sle/><qs/>"she'll read the books and understand 'em better nor half the folks as are growed up."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mill.c3.p17"><s sid="49" id="mill.c3.s49">Maggie's cheeks began to flush with triumphant excitement.</s> <s sid="50" id="mill.c3.s50">She thought Mr. Riley would have a respect for her now; it had been evident that he thought nothing of her before.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mill.c3.p18"><s sid="51" id="mill.c3.s51">Mr. Riley was turning over the leaves of the book, and she could make nothing of his face, with its high-arched eyebrows; but he presently looked at her, and said,--</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mill.c3.p20"><s sid="53" id="mill.c3.s53">Maggie, with deepening color, went without hesitation to Mr. Riley's elbow and looked over the book, eagerly seizing one corner, and tossing back her mane, while she said,--</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="mill.c3.p27" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="mill.c3.s74"><qs/>"Well,"<qe/><sls/> said Mr. Riley, in an admonitory, patronizing tone as he patted Maggie on the head, <sle/><qs/>"I advise you to put by the <alt-qs/>'History of the Devil,'<alt-qe/> and read some prettier book.</s> <s sid="75" id="mill.c3.s75">Have you no prettier books?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c4.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="mill.c4.s3"><qs/>"Maggie, Maggie!"<qe/><sls/> exclaimed Mrs. Tulliver, sitting stout and helpless with the brushes on her lap, <sle/><qs/>"what is to become of you if you're so naughty?</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c4.s4">I'll tell your aunt Glegg and your aunt Pullet when they come next week, and they'll never love you any more.</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c4.s5">Oh dear, oh dear! look at your clean pinafore, wet from top to bottom.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c4.s6">Folks 'ull think it's a judgment on me as I've got such a child,--they'll think I've done summat wicked."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c4.p3" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="mill.c4.s7">Before this remonstrance was finished, Maggie was already out of hearing, making her way toward the great attic that run under the old high-pitched roof, shaking the water from her black locks as she ran, like a Skye terrier escaped from his bath.</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c4.s8">This attic was Maggie's favorite retreat on a wet day, when the weather was not too cold; here she fretted out all her ill humors, and talked aloud to the worm-eaten floors and the worm-eaten shelves, and the dark rafters festooned with cobwebs; and here she kept a Fetish which she punished for all her misfortunes.</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c4.s9">This was the trunk of a large wooden doll, which once stared with the roundest of eyes above the reddest of cheeks; but was now entirely defaced by a long career of vicarious suffering.</s> <s sid="10" id="mill.c4.s10">Three nails driven into the head commemorated as many crises in Maggie's nine years of earthly struggle; that luxury of vengeance having been suggested to her by the picture of Jael destroying Sisera in the old Bible.</s> <s sid="11" id="mill.c4.s11">The last nail had been driven in with a fiercer stroke than usual, for the Fetish on that occasion represented aunt Glegg.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c4.s12">But immediately afterward Maggie had reflected that if she drove many nails in she would not be so well able to fancy that the head was hurt when she knocked it against the wall, nor to comfort it, and make believe to poultice it, when her fury was abated; for even aunt Glegg would be pitiable when she had been hurt very much, and thoroughly humiliated, so as to beg her niece's pardon.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c4.s13">Since then she had driven no more nails in, but had soothed herself by alternately grinding and beating the wooden head against the rough brick of the great chimneys that made two square pillars supporting the roof.</s> <s sid="14" id="mill.c4.s14">That was what she did this morning on reaching the attic, sobbing all the while with a passion that expelled every other form of consciousness,--even the memory of the grievance that had caused it.</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c4.s15">As at last the sobs were getting quieter, and the grinding less fierce, a sudden beam of sunshine, falling through the wire lattice across the worm-eaten shelves, made her throw away the Fetish and run to the window.</s> <s sid="16" id="mill.c4.s16">The sun was really breaking out; the sound of the mill seemed cheerful again; the granary doors were open; and there was Yap, the queer white-and-brown terrier, with one ear turned back, trotting about and sniffing vaguely, as if he were in search of a companion.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c4.s17">It was irresistible.</s> <s sid="18" id="mill.c4.s18">Maggie tossed her hair back and ran downstairs, seized her bonnet without putting it on, peeped, and then dashed along the passage lest she should encounter her mother, and was quickly out in the yard, whirling round like a Pythoness, and singing as she whirled, <qs/>"Yap, Yap, Tom's coming home!"<qe/> while Yap danced and barked round her, as much as to say, if there was any noise wanted he was the dog for it.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c4.p4" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="mill.c4.s19"><qs/>"Hegh, hegh, Miss! you'll make yourself giddy, an' tumble down i' the dirt,"<qe/> said Luke, the head miller, a tall, broad-shouldered man of forty, black-eyed and black-haired, subdued by a general mealiness, like an auricula.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c4.p5" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="mill.c4.s20">Maggie paused in her whirling and said, staggering a little, <qs/>"Oh no, it doesn't make me giddy, Luke; may I go into the mill with you?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mill.c4.p6"><s sid="21" id="mill.c4.s21">Maggie loved to linger in the great spaces of the mill, and often came out with her black hair powdered to a soft whiteness that made her dark eyes flash out with new fire.</s> <s sid="22" id="mill.c4.s22">The resolute din, the unresting motion of the great stones, giving her a dim, delicious awe as at the presence of an uncontrollable force; the meal forever pouring, pouring; the fine white powder softening all surfaces, and making the very spidernets look like a faery lace-work; the sweet, pure scent of the meal,--all helped to make Maggie feel that the mill was a little world apart from her outside every-day life.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c4.s23">The spiders were especially a subject of speculation with her.</s> <s sid="24" id="mill.c4.s24">She wondered if they had any relatives outside the mill, for in that case there must be a painful difficulty in their family intercourse,--a fat and floury spider, accustomed to take his fly well dusted with meal, must suffer a little at a cousin's table where the fly was _au naturel_, and the lady spiders must be mutually shocked at each other's appearance.</s> <s sid="25" id="mill.c4.s25">But the part of the mill she liked best was the topmost story,--the corn-hutch, where there were the great heaps of grain, which she could sit on and slide down continually.</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c4.s26">She was in the habit of taking this recreation as she conversed with Luke, to whom she was very communicative, wishing him to think well of her understanding, as her father did.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c4.p7"><s sid="27" id="mill.c4.s27">Perhaps she felt it necessary to recover her position with him on the present occasion for, as she sat sliding on the heap of grain near which he was busying himself, she said, at that shrill pitch which was requisite in mill-society,--</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c4.p9" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="mill.c4.s29"><qs/>"Nay, Miss, an' not much o' that,"<qe/> said Luke, with great frankness.</s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c4.s30"><qs/>"I'm no reader, I aren't."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mill.c4.p14" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="mill.c4.s40"><qs/>"Oh, well,"<qe/><sls/> said Maggie, rather foiled by Luke's unexpectedly decided views about Dutchmen, <sle/><qs/>"perhaps you would like 'Animated Nature' better; that's not Dutchmen, you know, but elephants and kangaroos, and the civet-cat, and the sunfish, and a bird sitting on its tail,--I forget its name.</s> <s sid="41" id="mill.c4.s41">There are countries full of those creatures, instead of horses and cows, you know.</s> <s sid="42" id="mill.c4.s42">Shouldn't you like to know about them, Luke?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mill.c4.p15" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="mill.c4.s43"><qs/>"Nay, Miss, I'n got to keep count o' the flour an' corn; I can't do wi' knowin' so many things besides my work.</s> <s sid="44" id="mill.c4.s44">That's what brings folks to the gallows,--knowin' everything but what they'n got to get their bread by.</s> <s sid="45" id="mill.c4.s45">An' they're mostly lies, I think, what's printed i' the books: them printed sheets are, anyhow, as the men cry i' the streets."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mill.c4.p19" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="mill.c4.s55"><qs/>"As dead as moles,"<qe/> said Luke, fetching his comparison from the unmistakable corpses nailed to the stable wall.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mill.c4.p24"><s sid="72" id="mill.c4.s72">The invitation offered an agreeable distraction to Maggie's grief, and her tears gradually subsided as she trotted along by Luke's side to his pleasant cottage, which stood with its apple and pear trees, and with the added dignity of a lean-to pigsty, at the other end of the Mill fields.</s> <s sid="73" id="mill.c4.s73">Mrs. Moggs, Luke's wife, was a decidely agreeable acquaintance.</s> <s sid="74" id="mill.c4.s74">She exhibited her hospitality in bread and treacle, and possessed various works of art.</s> <s sid="75" id="mill.c4.s75">Maggie actually forgot that she had any special cause of sadness this morning, as she stood on a chair to look at a remarkable series of pictures representing the Prodigal Son in the costume of Sir Charles Grandison, except that, as might have been expected from his defective moral character, he had not, like that accomplished hero, the taste and strength of mind to dispense with a wig.</s> <s sid="76" id="mill.c4.s76">But the indefinable weight the dead rabbits had left on her mind caused her to feel more than usual pity for the career of this weak young man, particularly when she looked at the picture where he leaned against a tree with a flaccid appearance, his knee-breeches unbuttoned and his wig awry, while the swine apparently of some foreign breed, seemed to insult him by their good spirits over their feast of husks.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c6.p10"><s sid="34" id="mill.c6.s34">In other respects the true Dodson was partly latent in Tom, and he was as far from appreciating his "kin" on the mother's side as Maggie herself, generally absconding for the day with a large supply of the most portable food, when he received timely warning that his aunts and uncles were coming,--a moral symptom from which his aunt Glegg deduced the gloomiest views of his future.</s> <s sid="35" id="mill.c6.s35">It was rather hard on Maggie that Tom always absconded without letting her into the secret, but the weaker sex are acknowledged to be serious _impedimenta_ in cases of flight.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mill.c7.p17"><s sid="51" id="mill.c7.s51">It is a pathetic sight and a striking example of the complexity introduced into the emotions by a high state of civilization, the sight of a fashionably dressed female in grief.</s> <s sid="52" id="mill.c7.s52">From the sorrow of a Hottentot to that of a woman in large buckram sleeves, with several bracelets on each arm, an architectural bonnet, and delicate ribbon strings, what a long series of gradations!</s> <s sid="53" id="mill.c7.s53">In the enlightened child of civilization the abandonment characteristic of grief is checked and varied in the subtlest manner, so as to present an interesting problem to the analytic mind.</s> <s sid="54" id="mill.c7.s54">If, with a crushed heart and eyes half blinded by the mist of tears, she were to walk with a too-devious step through a door-place, she might crush her buckram sleeves too, and the deep consciousness of this possibility produces a composition of forces by which she takes a line that just clears the door-post.</s> <s sid="55" id="mill.c7.s55">Perceiving that the tears are hurrying fast, she unpins her strings and throws them languidly backward, a touching gesture, indicative, even in the deepest gloom, of the hope in future dry moments when cap-strings will once more have a charm.</s> <s sid="56" id="mill.c7.s56">As the tears subside a little, and with her head leaning backward at the angle that will not injure her bonnet, she endures that terrible moment when grief, which has made all things else a weariness, has itself become weary; she looks down pensively at her bracelets, and adjusts their clasps with that pretty studied fortuity which would be gratifying to her mind if it were once more in a calm and healthy state.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mill.c7.p18"><s sid="57" id="mill.c7.s57">Mrs. Pullet brushed each door-post with great nicety, about the latitude of her shoulders (at that period a woman was truly ridiculous to an instructed eye if she did not measure a yard and a half across the shoulders), and having done that sent the muscles of her face in quest of fresh tears as she advanced into the parlor where Mrs. Glegg was seated.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="mill.c7.p37"><s sid="97" id="mill.c7.s97">Mrs. Tulliver was fond of going upstairs with her sister Pullet, and looking thoroughly at her cap before she put it on her head, and discussing millinery in general.</s> <s sid="98" id="mill.c7.s98">This was part of Bessy's weakness that stirred Mrs. Glegg's sisterly compassion:</s> <s sid="99" id="mill.c7.s99">Bessy went far too well dressed, considering; and she was too proud to dress her child in the good clothing her sister Glegg gave her from the primeval strata of her wardrobe; it was a sin and a shame to buy anything to dress that child, if it wasn't a pair of shoes.</s> <s sid="100" id="mill.c7.s100">In this particular, however, Mrs. Glegg did her sister Bessy some injustice, for Mrs. Tulliver had really made great efforts to induce Maggie to wear a leghorn bonnet and a dyed silk frock made out of her aunt Glegg's, but the results had been such that Mrs. Tulliver was obliged to bury them in her maternal bosom; for Maggie, declaring that the frock smelt of nasty dye, had taken an opportunity of basting it together with the roast beef the first Sunday she wore it, and finding this scheme answer, she had subsequently pumped on the bonnet with its green ribbons, so as to give it a general resemblance to a sage cheese garnished with withered lettuces.</s> <s sid="101" id="mill.c7.s101">I must urge in excuse for Maggie, that Tom had laughed at her in the bonnet, and said she looked like an old Judy.</s> <s sid="102" id="mill.c7.s102">Aunt Pullet, too, made presents of clothes, but these were always pretty enough to please Maggie as well as her mother.</s> <s sid="103" id="mill.c7.s103">Of all her sisters, Mrs. Tulliver certainly preferred her sister Pullet, not without a return of preference; but Mrs. Pullet was sorry Bessy had those naughty, awkward children; she would do the best she could by them, but it was a pity they weren't as good and as pretty as sister Deane's child.</s> <s sid="104" id="mill.c7.s104">Maggie and Tom, on their part, thought their aunt Pullet tolerable, chiefly because she was not their aunt Glegg.</s> <s sid="105" id="mill.c7.s105">Tom always declined to go more than once during his holidays to see either of them.</s> <s sid="106" id="mill.c7.s106">Both his uncles tipped him that once, of course; but at his aunt Pullet's there were a great many toads to pelt in the cellar-area, so that he preferred the visit to her.</s> <s sid="107" id="mill.c7.s107">Maggie shuddered at the toads, and dreamed of them horribly, but she liked her uncle Pullet's musical snuff-box.</s> <s sid="108" id="mill.c7.s108">Still, it was agreed by the sisters, in Mrs. Tulliver's absence, that the Tulliver blood did not mix well with the Dodson blood; that, in fact, poor Bessy's children were Tullivers, and that Tom, notwithstanding he had the Dodson complexion, was likely to be as "contrairy" as his father.</s> <s sid="109" id="mill.c7.s109">As for Maggie, she was the picture of her aunt Moss, Mr. Tulliver's sister,--a large-boned woman, who had married as poorly as could be; had no china, and had a husband who had much ado to pay his rent.</s> <s sid="110" id="mill.c7.s110">But when Mrs. Pullet was alone with Mrs. Tulliver upstairs, the remarks were naturally to the disadvantage of Mrs. Glegg, and they agreed, in confidence, that there was no knowing what sort of fright sister Jane would come out next.</s> <s sid="111" id="mill.c7.s111">But their _tete-a-tete_ was curtailed by the appearance of Mrs. Deane with little Lucy; and Mrs. Tulliver had to look on with a silent pang while Lucy's blond curls were adjusted.</s> <s sid="112" id="mill.c7.s112">It was quite unaccountable that Mrs. Deane, the thinnest and sallowest of all the Miss Dodsons, should have had this child, who might have been taken for Mrs. Tulliver's any day.</s> <s sid="113" id="mill.c7.s113">And Maggie always looked twice as dark as usual when she was by the side of Lucy.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="mill.c7.p38"><s sid="114" id="mill.c7.s114">She did to-day, when she and Tom came in from the garden with their father and their uncle Glegg.</s> <s sid="115" id="mill.c7.s115">Maggie had thrown her bonnet off very carelessly, and coming in with her hair rough as well as out of curl, rushed at once to Lucy, who was standing by her mother's knee.</s> <s sid="116" id="mill.c7.s116">Certainly the contrast between the cousins was conspicuous, and to superficial eyes was very much to the disadvantage of Maggie though a connoisseur might have seen "points" in her which had a higher promise for maturity than Lucy's natty completeness.</s> <s sid="117" id="mill.c7.s117">It was like the contrast between a rough, dark, overgrown puppy and a white kitten.</s> <s sid="118" id="mill.c7.s118">Lucy put up the neatest little rosebud mouth to be kissed; everything about her was neat,--her little round neck, with the row of coral beads; her little straight nose, not at all snubby; her little clear eyebrows, rather darker than her curls, to match hazel eyes, which looked up with shy pleasure at Maggie, taller by the head, though scarcely a year older.</s> <s sid="119" id="mill.c7.s119">Maggie always looked at Lucy with delight.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="mill.c7.p39"><s sid="120" id="mill.c7.s120">She was fond of fancying a world where the people never got any larger than children of their own age, and she made the queen of it just like Lucy, with a little crown on her head, and a little sceptre in her hand--only the queen was Maggie herself in Lucy's form.</s> </p>

<title>Chapter VIII Mr. Tulliver Shows His Weaker Side</title>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c8.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="mill.c8.s1"><qs/>"Suppose sister Glegg should call her money in; it 'ud be very awkward for you to have to raise five hundred pounds now,"<qe/> said Mrs. Tulliver to her husband that evening, as she took a plaintive review of the day.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c8.p2"><s sid="2" id="mill.c8.s2">Mrs. Tulliver had lived thirteen years with her husband, yet she retained in all the freshness of her early married life a facility of saying things which drove him in the opposite direction to the one she desired.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c8.s3">Some minds are wonderful for keeping their bloom in this way, as a patriarchal goldfish apparently retains to the last its youthful illusion that it can swim in a straight line beyond the encircling glass.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c8.s4">Mrs. Tulliver was an amiable fish of this kind, and after running her head against the same resisting medium for thirteen years would go at it again to-day with undulled alacrity.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c8.p3"><s sid="5" id="mill.c8.s5">This observation of hers tended directly to convince Mr. Tulliver that it would not be at all awkward for him to raise five hundred pounds; and when Mrs. Tulliver became rather pressing to know _how_ he would raise it without mortgaging the mill and the house which he had said he never _would_ mortgage, since nowadays people were none so ready to lend money without security, Mr. Tulliver, getting warm, declared that Mrs. Glegg might do as she liked about calling in her money, he should pay it in whether or not.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c8.s6">He was not going to be beholden to his wife's sisters.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c8.s7">When a man had married into a family where there was a whole litter of women, he might have plenty to put up with if he chose.</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c8.s8">But Mr. Tulliver did _not_ choose.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c8.p4"><s sid="9" id="mill.c8.s9">Mrs. Tulliver cried a little in a trickling, quiet way as she put on her nightcap; but presently sank into a comfortable sleep, lulled by the thought that she would talk everything over with her sister Pullet to-morrow, when she was to take the children to Garum Firs to tea.</s> <s sid="10" id="mill.c8.s10">Not that she looked forward to any distinct issue from that talk; but it seemed impossible that past events should be so obstinate as to remain unmodified when they were complained against.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c8.p5"><s sid="11" id="mill.c8.s11">Her husband lay awake rather longer, for he too was thinking of a visit he would pay on the morrow; and his ideas on the subject were not of so vague and soothing a kind as those of his amiable partner.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mill.c8.p6"><s sid="12" id="mill.c8.s12">Mr. Tulliver, when under the influence of a strong feeling, had a promptitude in action that may seem inconsistent with that painful sense of the complicated, puzzling nature of human affairs under which his more dispassionate deliberations were conducted; but it is really not improbable that there was a direct relation between these apparently contradictory phenomena, since I have observed that for getting a strong impression that a skein is tangled there is nothing like snatching hastily at a single thread.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c8.s13">It was owing to this promptitude that Mr. Tulliver was on horseback soon after dinner the next day (he was not dyspeptic) on his way to Basset to see his sister Moss and her husband.</s> <s sid="14" id="mill.c8.s14">For having made up his mind irrevocably that he would pay Mrs. Glegg her loan of five hundred pounds, it naturally occurred to him that he had a promissory note for three hundred pounds lent to his brother-in-law Moss; and if the said brother-in-law could manage to pay in the money within a given time, it would go far to lessen the fallacious air of inconvenience which Mr. Tulliver's spirited step might have worn in the eyes of weak people who require to know precisely _how_ a thing is to be done before they are strongly confident that it will be easy.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c8.p7" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="mill.c8.s15">For Mr. Tulliver was in a position neither new nor striking, but, like other every-day things, sure to have a cumulative effect that will be felt in the long run: he was held to be a much more substantial man than he really was.</s> <s sid="16" id="mill.c8.s16">And as we are all apt to believe what the world believes about us, it was his habit to think of failure and ruin with the same sort of remote pity with which a spare, long-necked man hears that his plethoric short-necked neighbor is stricken with apoplexy.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c8.s17">He had been always used to hear pleasant jokes about his advantages as a man who worked his own mill, and owned a pretty bit of land; and these jokes naturally kept up his sense that he was a man of considerable substance.</s> <s sid="18" id="mill.c8.s18">They gave a pleasant flavor to his glass on a market-day, and if it had not been for the recurrence of half-yearly payments, Mr. Tulliver would really have forgotten that there was a mortgage of two thousand pounds on his very desirable freehold.</s> <s sid="19" id="mill.c8.s19">That was not altogether his own fault, since one of the thousand pounds was his sister's fortune, which he had to pay on her marriage; and a man who has neighbors that _will_ go to law with him is not likely to pay off his mortgages, especially if he enjoys the good opinion of acquaintances who want to borrow a hundred pounds on security too lofty to be represented by parchment.</s> <s sid="20" id="mill.c8.s20">Our friend Mr. Tulliver had a good-natured fibre in him, and did not like to give harsh refusals even to his sister, who had not only come in to the world in that superfluous way characteristic of sisters, creating a necessity for mortgages, but had quite thrown herself away in marriage, and had crowned her mistakes by having an eighth baby.</s> <s sid="21" id="mill.c8.s21">On this point Mr. Tulliver was conscious of being a little weak; but he apologized to himself by saying that poor Gritty had been a good-looking wench before she married Moss; he would sometimes say this even with a slight tremulousness in his voice.</s> <s sid="22" id="mill.c8.s22">But this morning he was in a mood more becoming a man of business, and in the course of his ride along the Basset lanes, with their deep ruts,--lying so far away from a market-town that the labor of drawing produce and manure was enough to take away the best part of the profits on such poor land as that parish was made of,--he got up a due amount of irritation against Moss as a man without capital, who, if murrain and blight were abroad, was sure to have his share of them, and who, the more you tried to help him out of the mud, would sink the further in.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c8.s23">It would do him good rather than harm, now, if he were obliged to raise this three hundred pounds; it would make him look about him better, and not act so foolishly about his wool this year as he did the last; in fact, Mr. Tulliver had been too easy with his brother-in-law, and because he had let the interest run on for two years, Moss was likely enough to think that he should never be troubled about the principal.</s> <s sid="24" id="mill.c8.s24">But Mr. Tulliver was determined not to encourage such shuffling people any longer; and a ride along the Basset lanes was not likely to enervate a man's resolution by softening his temper.</s> <s sid="25" id="mill.c8.s25">The deep-trodden hoof-marks, made in the muddiest days of winter, gave him a shake now and then which suggested a rash but stimulating snarl at the father of lawyers, who, whether by means of his hoof or otherwise, had doubtless something to do with this state of the roads; and the abundance of foul land and neglected fences that met his eye, though they made no part of his brother Moss's farm, strongly contributed to his dissatisfaction with that unlucky agriculturist.</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c8.s26">If this wasn't Moss's fallow, it might have been; Basset was all alike; it was a beggarly parish, in Mr. Tulliver's opinion, and his opinion was certainly not groundless.</s> <s sid="27" id="mill.c8.s27">Basset had a poor soil, poor roads, a poor non-resident landlord, a poor non-resident vicar, and rather less than half a curate, also poor.</s> <s sid="28" id="mill.c8.s28">If any one strongly impressed with the power of the human mind to triumph over circumstances will contend that the parishioners of Basset might nevertheless have been a very superior class of people, I have nothing to urge against that abstract proposition; I only know that, in point of fact, the Basset mind was in strict keeping with its circumstances.</s> <s sid="29" id="mill.c8.s29">The muddy lanes, green or clayey, that seemed to the unaccustomed eye to lead nowhere but into each other, did really lead, with patience, to a distant high-road; but there were many feet in Basset which they led more frequently to a centre of dissipation, spoken of formerly as the <qs/>"Markis o' Granby,"<qe/><sss/> but among intimates as <sse/><qs/>"Dickison's."<qe/></s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c8.s30">A large low room with a sanded floor; a cold scent of tobacco, modified by undetected beer-dregs; Mr. Dickison leaning against the door-post with a melancholy pimpled face, looking as irrelevant to the daylight as a last night's guttered candle,--all this may not seem a very seductive form of temptation; but the majority of men in Basset found it fatally alluring when encountered on their road toward four o'clock on a wintry afternoon; and if any wife in Basset wished to indicate that her husband was not a pleasure-seeking man, she could hardly do it more emphatically than by saying that he didn't spend a shilling at Dickison's from one Whitsuntide to another.</s> <s sid="31" id="mill.c8.s31">Mrs. Moss had said so of _her_ husband more than once, when her brother was in a mood to find fault with him, as he certainly was to-day.</s> <s sid="32" id="mill.c8.s32">And nothing could be less pacifying to Mr. Tulliver than the behavior of the farmyard gate, which he no sooner attempted to push open with his riding-stick than it acted as gates without the upper hinge are known to do, to the peril of shins, whether equine or human.</s> <s sid="33" id="mill.c8.s33">He was about to get down and lead his horse through the damp dirt of the hollow farmyard, shadowed drearily by the large half-timbered buildings, up to the long line of tumble-down dwelling-houses standing on a raised causeway; but the timely appearance of a cowboy saved him that frustration of a plan he had determined on,--namely, not to get down from his horse during this visit.</s> <s sid="34" id="mill.c8.s34">If a man means to be hard, let him keep in his saddle and speak from that height, above the level of pleading eyes, and with the command of a distant horizon.</s> <s sid="35" id="mill.c8.s35">Mrs. Moss heard the sound of the horse's feet, and, when her brother rode up, was already outside the kitchen door, with a half-weary smile on her face, and a black-eyed baby in her arms.</s> <s sid="36" id="mill.c8.s36">Mrs. Moss's face bore a faded resemblance to her brother's; baby's little fat hand, pressed against her cheek, seemed to show more strikingly that the cheek was faded.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mill.c8.p8" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="mill.c8.s37"><qs/>"Brother, I'm glad to see you,"<qe/> she said, in an affectionate tone.</s> <s sid="38" id="mill.c8.s38"><qs/>"I didn't look for you to-day.</s> <s sid="39" id="mill.c8.s39">How do you do?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c8.p9" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="mill.c8.s40"><qs/>"Oh, pretty well, Mrs. Moss, pretty well,"<qe/> answered the brother, with cool deliberation, as if it were rather too forward of her to ask that question.</s> <s sid="41" id="mill.c8.s41">She knew at once that her brother was not in a good humor; he never called her Mrs. Moss except when he was angry, and when they were in company.</s> <s sid="42" id="mill.c8.s42">But she thought it was in the order of nature that people who were poorly off should be snubbed.</s> <s sid="43" id="mill.c8.s43">Mrs. Moss did not take her stand on the equality of the human race; she was a patient, prolific, loving-hearted woman.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c8.p10" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="mill.c8.s44"><qs/>"Your husband isn't in the house, I suppose?"<qe/> added Mr. Tulliver after a grave pause, during which four children had run out, like chickens whose mother has been suddenly in eclipse behind the hen-coop.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mill.c8.p11" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="mill.c8.s45"><qs/>"No,"<qe/><sss/> said Mrs. Moss, <sse/><qs/>"but he's only in the potato-field yonders.</s> <s sid="46" id="mill.c8.s46">Georgy, run to the Far Close in a minute, and tell father your uncle's come.</s> <s sid="47" id="mill.c8.s47">You'll get down, brother, won't you, and take something?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mill.c8.p13" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="mill.c8.s50"><qs/>"And how's Mrs. Tulliver and the children?"<qe/> said Mrs. Moss, humbly, not daring to press her invitation.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mill.c8.p14" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="mill.c8.s51"><qs/>"Oh, pretty well.</s> <s sid="52" id="mill.c8.s52">Tom's going to a new school at Midsummer,--a deal of expense to me.</s> <s sid="53" id="mill.c8.s53">It's bad work for me, lying out o' my money."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mill.c8.p15" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="mill.c8.s54"><qs/>"I wish you'd be so good as let the children come and see their cousins some day.</s> <s sid="55" id="mill.c8.s55">My little uns want to see their cousin Maggie so as never was.</s> <s sid="56" id="mill.c8.s56">And me her godmother, and so fond of her; there's nobody 'ud make a bigger fuss with her, according to what they've got.</s> <s sid="57" id="mill.c8.s57">And I know she likes to come, for she's a loving child, and how quick and clever she is, to be sure!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mill.c8.p16"><s sid="58" id="mill.c8.s58">If Mrs. Moss had been one of the most astute women in the world, instead of being one of the simplest, she could have thought of nothing more likely to propitiate her brother than this praise of Maggie.</s> <s sid="59" id="mill.c8.s59">He seldom found any one volunteering praise of "the little wench"; it was usually left entirely to himself to insist on her merits.</s> <s sid="60" id="mill.c8.s60">But Maggie always appeared in the most amiable light at her aunt Moss's; it was her Alsatia, where she was out of the reach of law,--if she upset anything, dirtied her shoes, or tore her frock, these things were matters of course at her aunt Moss's.</s> <s sid="61" id="mill.c8.s61">In spite of himself, Mr. Tulliver's eyes got milder, and he did not look away from his sister as he said,--</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mill.c8.p17" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="mill.c8.s62"><qs/>"Ay; she's fonder o' you than o' the other aunts, I think.</s> <s sid="63" id="mill.c8.s63">She takes after our family: not a bit of her mother's in her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mill.c8.p18" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="mill.c8.s64"><qs/>"Moss says she's just like what I used to be,"<qe/><sss/> said Mrs. Moss, <sse/><qs/>"though I was never so quick and fond o' the books.</s> <s sid="65" id="mill.c8.s65">But I think my Lizzy's like her; _she's_ sharp.</s> <s sid="66" id="mill.c8.s66">Come here, Lizzy, my dear, and let your uncle see you; he hardly knows you, you grow so fast."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mill.c8.p19"><s sid="67" id="mill.c8.s67">Lizzy, a black-eyed child of seven, looked very shy when her mother drew her forward, for the small Mosses were much in awe of their uncle from Dorlcote Mill.</s> <s sid="68" id="mill.c8.s68">She was inferior enough to Maggie in fire and strength of expression to make the resemblance between the two entirely flattering to Mr. Tulliver's fatherly love.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mill.c8.p20" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="mill.c8.s69"><qs/>"Ay, they're a bit alike,"<qe/> he said, looking kindly at the little figure in the soiled pinafore.</s> <s sid="70" id="mill.c8.s70"><qs/>"They both take after our mother.</s> <s sid="71" id="mill.c8.s71">You've got enough o' gells, Gritty,"<qe/> he added, in a tone half compassionate, half reproachful.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mill.c8.p21" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="mill.c8.s72"><qs/>"Four of 'em, bless 'em!"<qe/><sls/> said Mrs. Moss, with a sigh, stroking Lizzy's hair on each side of her forehead; <sle/><qs/>"as many as there's boys.</s> <s sid="73" id="mill.c8.s73">They've got a brother apiece."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mill.c8.p23" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="mill.c8.s75"><qs/>"No; but I hope their brothers 'ull love the poor things, and remember they came o' one father and mother; the lads 'ull never be the poorer for that,"<qe/> said Mrs. Moss, flashing out with hurried timidity, like a half-smothered fire.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mill.c8.p24" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="mill.c8.s76">Mr. Tulliver gave his horse a little stroke on the flank, then checked it, and said angrily, <qs/>"Stand still with you!"<qe/> much to the astonishment of that innocent animal.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="mill.c8.p26"><s sid="79" id="mill.c8.s79">The arrow went straight to Mr. Tulliver's heart.</s> <s sid="80" id="mill.c8.s80">He had not a rapid imagination, but the thought of Maggie was very near to him, and he was not long in seeing his relation to his own sister side by side with Tom's relation to Maggie.</s> <s sid="81" id="mill.c8.s81">Would the little wench ever be poorly off, and Tom rather hard upon her?</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="mill.c8.p27" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="mill.c8.s82"><qs/>"Ay, ay, Gritty,"<qe/><sls/> said the miller, with a new softness in his tone; <sle/><qs/>"but I've allays done what I could for you,"<qe/> he added, as if vindicating himself from a reproach.</s> </p>

<title>Chapter IX To Garum Firs</title>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c9.p1"><s sid="1" id="mill.c9.s1">While the possible troubles of Maggie's future were occupying her father's mind, she herself was tasting only the bitterness of the present.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c9.s2">Childhood has no forebodings; but then, it is soothed by no memories of outlived sorrow.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c9.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="mill.c9.s3">The fact was, the day had begun ill with Maggie.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c9.s4">The pleasure of having Lucy to look at, and the prospect of the afternoon visit to Garum Firs, where she would hear uncle Pullet's musical box, had been marred as early as eleven o'clock by the advent of the hair-dresser from St.</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c9.s5">Ogg's, who had spoken in the severest terms of the condition in which he had found her hair, holding up one jagged lock after another and saying, <qs/>"See here! tut, tut, tut!"<qe/> in a tone of mingled disgust and pity, which to Maggie's imagination was equivalent to the strongest expression of public opinion.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c9.s6">Mr. Rappit, the hair-dresser, with his well-anointed coronal locks tending wavily upward, like the simulated pyramid of flame on a monumental urn, seemed to her at that moment the most formidable of her contemporaries, into whose street at St.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c9.s7">Ogg's she would carefully refrain from entering through the rest of her life.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c9.p3" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="mill.c9.s8">Moreover, the preparation for a visit being always a serious affair in the Dodson family, Martha was enjoined to have Mrs. Tulliver's room ready an hour earlier than usual, that the laying out of the best clothes might not be deferred till the last moment, as was sometimes the case in families of lax views, where the ribbon-strings were never rolled up, where there was little or no wrapping in silver paper, and where the sense that the Sunday clothes could be got at quite easily produced no shock to the mind.</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c9.s9">Already, at twelve o'clock, Mrs. Tulliver had on her visiting costume, with a protective apparatus of brown holland, as if she had been a piece of satin furniture in danger of flies; Maggie was frowning and twisting her shoulders, that she might if possible shrink away from the prickliest of tuckers, while her mother was remonstrating, <qs/>"Don't, Maggie, my dear; don't make yourself so ugly!"<qe/> and Tom's cheeks were looking particularly brilliant as a relief to his best blue suit, which he wore with becoming calmness, having, after a little wrangling, effected what was always the one point of interest to him in his toilet: he had transferred all the contents of his every-day pockets to those actually in wear.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c9.p4" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="mill.c9.s10">As for Lucy, she was just as pretty and neat as she had been yesterday; no accidents ever happened to her clothes, and she was never uncomfortable in them, so that she looked with wondering pity at Maggie, pouting and writhing under the exasperating tucker.</s> <s sid="11" id="mill.c9.s11">Maggie would certainly have torn it off, if she had not been checked by the remembrance of her recent humiliation about her hair; as it was, she confined herself to fretting and twisting, and behaving peevishly about the card-houses which they were allowed to build till dinner, as a suitable amusement for boys and girls in their best clothes.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c9.s12">Tom could build perfect pyramids of houses; but Maggie's would never bear the laying on the roof.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c9.s13">It was always so with the things that Maggie made; and Tom had deduced the conclusion that no girls could ever make anything.</s> <s sid="14" id="mill.c9.s14">But it happened that Lucy proved wonderfully clever at building; she handled the cards so lightly, and moved so gently, that Tom condescended to admire her houses as well as his own, the more readily because she had asked him to teach her.</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c9.s15">Maggie, too, would have admired Lucy's houses, and would have given up her own unsuccessful building to contemplate them, without ill temper, if her tucker had not made her peevish, and if Tom had not inconsiderately laughed when her houses fell, and told her she was <qs/>"a stupid."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c9.p5" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="mill.c9.s16"><qs/>"Don't laugh at me, Tom!"<qe/><sss/> she burst out angrily; <sse/><qs/>"I'm not a stupid.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c9.s17">I know a great many things you don't."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c9.p7" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="mill.c9.s22"><qs/>"Then it's very wicked and cruel of you to wish so,"<qe/> said Maggie, starting up hurriedly from her place on the floor, and upsetting Tom's wonderful pagoda.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c9.s23">She really did not mean it, but the circumstantial evidence was against her, and Tom turned white with anger, but said nothing; he would have struck her, only he knew it was cowardly to strike a girl, and Tom Tulliver was quite determined he would never do anything cowardly.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mill.c9.p8"><s sid="24" id="mill.c9.s24">Maggie stood in dismay and terror, while Tom got up from the floor and walked away, pale, from the scattered ruins of his pagoda, and Lucy looked on mutely, like a kitten pausing from its lapping.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c9.p9" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="mill.c9.s25"><qs/>"Oh, Tom,"<qe/><sls/> said Maggie, at last, going half-way toward him, <sle/><qs/>"I didn't mean to knock it down, indeed, indeed I didn't."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c9.p10"><s sid="26" id="mill.c9.s26">Tom took no notice of her, but took, instead, two or three hard peas out of his pocket, and shot them with his thumbnail against the window, vaguely at first, but presently with the distinct aim of hitting a superannuated blue-bottle which was exposing its imbecility in the spring sunshine, clearly against the views of Nature, who had provided Tom and the peas for the speedy destruction of this weak individual.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mill.c9.p11" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="mill.c9.s27">Thus the morning had been made heavy to Maggie, and Tom's persistent coldness to her all through their walk spoiled the fresh air and sunshine for her.</s> <s sid="28" id="mill.c9.s28">He called Lucy to look at the half-built bird's nest without caring to show it Maggie, and peeled a willow switch for Lucy and himself, without offering one to Maggie.</s> <s sid="29" id="mill.c9.s29">Lucy had said, <qs/>"Maggie, shouldn't _you_ like one?"<qe/> but Tom was deaf.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mill.c9.p12"><s sid="30" id="mill.c9.s30">Still, the sight of the peacock opportunely spreading his tail on the stackyard wall, just as they reached Garum Firs, was enough to divert the mind temporarily from personal grievances.</s> <s sid="31" id="mill.c9.s31">And this was only the beginning of beautiful sights at Garum Firs.</s> <s sid="32" id="mill.c9.s32">All the farmyard life was wonderful there,--bantams, speckled and top-knotted; Friesland hens, with their feathers all turned the wrong way; Guinea-fowls that flew and screamed and dropped their pretty spotted feathers; pouter-pigeons and a tame magpie; nay, a goat, and a wonderful brindled dog, half mastiff, half bull-dog, as large as a lion.</s> <s sid="33" id="mill.c9.s33">Then there were white railings and white gates all about, and glittering weathercocks of various design, and garden-walks paved with pebbles in beautiful patterns,--nothing was quite common at Garum Firs; and Tom thought that the unusual size of the toads there was simply due to the general unusualness which characterized uncle Pullet's possessions as a gentleman farmer.</s> <s sid="34" id="mill.c9.s34">Toads who paid rent were naturally leaner.</s> <s sid="35" id="mill.c9.s35">As for the house, it was not less remarkable; it had a receding centre, and two wings with battlemented turrets, and was covered with glittering white stucco.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mill.c9.p13" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="mill.c9.s36">Uncle Pullet had seen the expected party approaching from the window, and made haste to unbar and unchain the front door, kept always in this fortified condition from fear of tramps, who might be supposed to know of the glass case of stuffed birds in the hall, and to contemplate rushing in and carrying it away on their heads.</s> <s sid="37" id="mill.c9.s37">Aunt Pullet, too, appeared at the doorway, and as soon as her sister was within hearing said, <qs/>"Stop the children, for God's sake!</s> <s sid="38" id="mill.c9.s38">Bessy; don't let 'em come up the door-steps; Sally's bringing the old mat and the duster, to rub their shoes."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mill.c9.p14"><s sid="39" id="mill.c9.s39">Mrs. Pullet's front-door mats were by no means intended to wipe shoes on; the very scraper had a deputy to do its dirty work.</s> <s sid="40" id="mill.c9.s40">Tom rebelled particularly against this shoewiping, which he always considered in the light of an indignity to his sex.</s> <s sid="41" id="mill.c9.s41">He felt it as the beginning of the disagreeables incident to a visit at aunt Pullet's, where he had once been compelled to sit with towels wrapped round his boots; a fact which may serve to correct the too-hasty conclusion that a visit to Garum Firs must have been a great treat to a young gentleman fond of animals,--fond, that is, of throwing stones at them.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mill.c9.p15"><s sid="42" id="mill.c9.s42">The next disagreeable was confined to his feminine companions; it was the mounting of the polished oak stairs, which had very handsome carpets rolled up and laid by in a spare bedroom, so that the ascent of these glossy steps might have served, in barbarous times, as a trial by ordeal from which none but the most spotless virtue could have come off with unbroken limbs.</s> <s sid="43" id="mill.c9.s43">Sophy's weakness about these polished stairs was always a subject of bitter remonstrance on Mrs. Glegg's part; but Mrs. Tulliver ventured on no comment, only thinking to herself it was a mercy when she and the children were safe on the landing.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mill.c9.p16" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="mill.c9.s44"><qs/>"Mrs. Gray has sent home my new bonnet, Bessy,"<qe/> said Mrs. Pullet, in a pathetic tone, as Mrs. Tulliver adjusted her cap.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mill.c9.p17" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="mill.c9.s45"><qs/>"Has she, sister?"<qe/> said Mrs. Tulliver, with an air of much interest.</s> <s sid="46" id="mill.c9.s46"><qs/>"And how do you like it?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mill.c9.p18" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="mill.c9.s47"><qs/>"It's apt to make a mess with clothes, taking 'em out and putting 'em in again,"<qe/><sls/> said Mrs. Pullet, drawing a bunch of keys from her pocket and looking at them earnestly, <sle/><qs/>"but it 'ud be a pity for you to go away without seeing it.</s> <s sid="48" id="mill.c9.s48">There's no knowing what may happen."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mill.c9.p19"><s sid="49" id="mill.c9.s49">Mrs. Pullet shook her head slowly at this last serious consideration, which determined her to single out a particular key.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mill.c9.p20" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="mill.c9.s50"><qs/>"I'm afraid it'll be troublesome to you getting it out, sister,"<qe/><sss/> said Mrs. Tulliver; <sse/><qs/>"but I _should_ like to see what sort of a crown she's made you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mill.c9.p21"><s sid="51" id="mill.c9.s51">Mrs. Pullet rose with a melancholy air and unlocked one wing of a very bright wardrobe, where you may have hastily supposed she would find a new bonnet.</s> <s sid="52" id="mill.c9.s52">Not at all.</s> <s sid="53" id="mill.c9.s53">Such a supposition could only have arisen from a too-superficial acquaintance with the habits of the Dodson family.</s> <s sid="54" id="mill.c9.s54">In this wardrobe Mrs. Pullet was seeking something small enough to be hidden among layers of linen,--it was a door-key.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mill.c9.p22" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="mill.c9.s55"><qs/>"You must come with me into the best room,"<qe/> said Mrs. Pullet.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mill.c9.p23" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="mill.c9.s56"><qs/>"May the children come too, sister?"<qe/> inquired Mrs. Tulliver, who saw that Maggie and Lucy were looking rather eager.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mill.c9.p24" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="mill.c9.s57"><qs/>"Well,"<qe/><sss/> said aunt Pullet, reflectively, <sse/><qs/>"it'll perhaps be safer for 'em to come; they'll be touching something if we leave 'em behind."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="mill.c9.p25"><s sid="58" id="mill.c9.s58">So they went in procession along the bright and slippery corridor, dimly lighted by the semi-lunar top of the window which rose above the closed shutter; it was really quite solemn.</s> <s sid="59" id="mill.c9.s59">Aunt Pullet paused and unlocked a door which opened on something still more solemn than the passage,--a darkened room, in which the outer light, entering feebly, showed what looked like the corpses of furniture in white shrouds.</s> <s sid="60" id="mill.c9.s60">Everything that was not shrouded stood with its legs upward.</s> <s sid="61" id="mill.c9.s61">Lucy laid hold of Maggie's frock, and Maggie's heart beat rapidly.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="mill.c9.p26" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="mill.c9.s62">Aunt Pullet half-opened the shutter and then unlocked the wardrobe, with a melancholy deliberateness which was quite in keeping with the funereal solemnity of the scene.</s> <s sid="63" id="mill.c9.s63">The delicious scent of rose-leaves that issued from the wardrobe made the process of taking out sheet after sheet of silver paper quite pleasant to assist at, though the sight of the bonnet at last was an anticlimax to Maggie, who would have preferred something more strikingly preternatural.</s> <s sid="64" id="mill.c9.s64">But few things could have been more impressive to Mrs. Tulliver.</s> <s sid="65" id="mill.c9.s65">She looked all round it in silence for some moments, and then said emphatically, <qs/>"Well, sister, I'll never speak against the full crowns again!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="mill.c9.p27"><s sid="66" id="mill.c9.s66">It was a great concession, and Mrs. Pullet felt it; she felt something was due to it.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="mill.c9.p28" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="mill.c9.s67"><qs/>"You'd like to see it on, sister?"<qe/> she said sadly.</s> <s sid="68" id="mill.c9.s68"><qs/>"I'll open the shutter a bit further."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="mill.c9.p29" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="mill.c9.s69"><qs/>"Well, if you don't mind taking off your cap, sister,"<qe/> said Mrs. Tulliver.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="mill.c9.p30"><s sid="70" id="mill.c9.s70">Mrs. Pullet took off her cap, displaying the brown silk scalp with a jutting promontory of curls which was common to the more mature and judicious women of those times, and placing the bonnet on her head, turned slowly round, like a draper's lay-figure, that Mrs. Tulliver might miss no point of view.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="mill.c9.p31" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="mill.c9.s71"><qs/>"I've sometimes thought there's a loop too much o' ribbon on this left side, sister; what do you think?"<qe/> said Mrs. Pullet.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="mill.c9.p32" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="mill.c9.s72">Mrs. Tulliver looked earnestly at the point indicated, and turned her head on one side.</s> <s sid="73" id="mill.c9.s73"><qs/>"Well, I think it's best as it is; if you meddled with it, sister, you might repent."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="mill.c9.p33" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="mill.c9.s74"><qs/>"That's true,"<qe/> said aunt Pullet, taking off the bonnet and looking at it contemplatively.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="mill.c9.p34" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="mill.c9.s75"><qs/>"How much might she charge you for that bonnet, sister?"<qe/> said Mrs. Tulliver, whose mind was actively engaged on the possibility of getting a humble imitation of this _chef-d'oeuvre_ made from a piece of silk she had at home.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mill.c10.p11"><s sid="30" id="mill.c10.s30">Tom walked along, and Lucy trotted by his side, timidly enjoying the rare treat of doing something naughty,--excited also by the mention of that celebrity, the pike, about which she was quite uncertain whether it was a fish or a fowl.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mill.c10.p14"><s sid="36" id="mill.c10.s36">Lucy came carefully as she was bidden, and bent down to look at what seemed a golden arrow-head darting through the water.</s> <s sid="37" id="mill.c10.s37">It was a water-snake, Tom told her; and Lucy at last could see the serpentine wave of its body, very much wondering that a snake could swim.</s> <s sid="38" id="mill.c10.s38">Maggie had drawn nearer and nearer; she _must_ see it too, though it was bitter to her, like everything else, since Tom did not care about her seeing it.</s> <s sid="39" id="mill.c10.s39">At last she was close by Lucy; and Tom, who had been aware of her approach, but would not notice it till he was obliged, turned round and said,--</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mill.c10.p21"><s sid="54" id="mill.c10.s54">Tom's imagination had not been rapid and capacious enough to include this question among the foreseen consequences, but it was no sooner put than he foresaw whither it tended, and that Maggie would not be considered the only culprit in the case.</s> <s sid="55" id="mill.c10.s55">He walked quietly away from the kitchen door, leaving Sally to that pleasure of guessing which active minds notoriously prefer to ready-made knowledge.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mill.c10.p22"><s sid="56" id="mill.c10.s56">Sally, as you are aware, lost no time in presenting Lucy at the parlor door, for to have so dirty an object introduced into the house at Garum Firs was too great a weight to be sustained by a single mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c11.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="mill.c11.s1">Maggie's intentions, as usual, were on a larger scale than Tom imagined.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c11.s2">The resolution that gathered in her mind, after Tom and Lucy had walked away, was not so simple as that of going home.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c11.s3">No! she would run away and go to the gypsies, and Tom should never see her any more.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c11.s4">That was by no means a new idea to Maggie; she had been so often told she was like a gypsy, and <qs/>"half wild,"<qe/> that when she was miserable it seemed to her the only way of escaping opprobrium, and being entirely in harmony with circumstances, would be to live in a little brown tent on the commons; the gypsies, she considered, would gladly receive her and pay her much respect on account of her superior knowledge.</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c11.s5">She had once mentioned her views on this point to Tom and suggested that he should stain his face brown, and they should run away together; but Tom rejected the scheme with contempt, observing that gypsies were thieves, and hardly got anything to eat and had nothing to drive but a donkey.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c11.s6">To-day however, Maggie thought her misery had reached a pitch at which gypsydom was her refuge, and she rose from her seat on the roots of the tree with the sense that this was a great crisis in her life; she would run straight away till she came to Dunlow Common, where there would certainly be gypsies; and cruel Tom, and the rest of her relations who found fault with her, should never see her any more.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c11.s7">She thought of her father as she ran along, but she reconciled herself to the idea of parting with him, by determining that she would secretly send him a letter by a small gypsy, who would run away without telling where she was, and just let him know that she was well and happy, and always loved him very much.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c11.p2" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="mill.c11.s8">Maggie soon got out of breath with running, but by the time Tom got to the pond again she was at the distance of three long fields, and was on the edge of the lane leading to the highroad.</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c11.s9">She stopped to pant a little, reflecting that running away was not a pleasant thing until one had got quite to the common where the gypsies were, but her resolution had not abated;

Tom had said that her cropped hair made her look like an idiot, and it was too painful an idea to be readily forgotten.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c11.s17">Besides, she had no sleeves on,--only a cape and bonnet.</s> <s sid="18" id="mill.c11.s18">It was clear that she was not likely to make a favorable impression on passengers, and she thought she would turn into the fields again, but not on the same side of the lane as before, lest they should still be uncle Pullet's fields.</s> <s sid="19" id="mill.c11.s19">She turned through the first gate that was not locked, and felt a delightful sense of privacy in creeping along by the hedgerows, after her recent humiliating encounter.</s> <s sid="20" id="mill.c11.s20">She was used to wandering about the fields by herself, and was less timid there than on the highroad.</s> <s sid="21" id="mill.c11.s21">Sometimes she had to climb over high gates, but that was a small evil; she was getting out of reach very fast, and she should probably soon come within sight of Dunlow Common, or at least of some other common, for she had heard her father say that you couldn't go very far without coming to a common.</s> <s sid="22" id="mill.c11.s22">She hoped so, for she was getting rather tired and hungry, and until she reached the gypsies there was no definite prospect of bread and butter.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c11.s23">It was still broad daylight, for aunt Pullet, retaining the early habits of the Dodson family, took tea at half-past four by the sun, and at five by the kitchen clock; so, though it was nearly an hour since Maggie started, there was no gathering gloom on the fields to remind her that the night would come.</s> <s sid="24" id="mill.c11.s24">Still, it seemed to her that she had been walking a very great distance indeed, and it was really surprising that the common did not come within sight.</s> <s sid="25" id="mill.c11.s25">Hitherto she had been in the rich parish of Garum, where was a great deal of pasture-land, and she had only seen one laborer at a distance.</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c11.s26">That was fortunate in some respects, as laborers might be too ignorant to understand the propriety of her wanting to go to Dunlow Common; yet it would have been better if she could have met some one who would tell her the way without wanting to know anything about her private business.</s> <s sid="27" id="mill.c11.s27">At last, however, the green fields came to an end, and Maggie found herself looking through the bars of a gate into a lane with a wide margin of grass on each side of it.</s> <s sid="28" id="mill.c11.s28">She had never seen such a wide lane before, and, without her knowing why, it gave her the impression that the common could not be far off; perhaps it was because she saw a donkey with a log to his foot feeding on the grassy margin, for she had seen a donkey with that pitiable encumbrance on Dunlow Common when she had been across it in her father's gig.</s> <s sid="29" id="mill.c11.s29">She crept through the bars of the gate and walked on with new spirit, though not without haunting images of Apollyon, and a highwayman with a pistol, and a blinking dwarf in yellow with a mouth from ear to ear, and other miscellaneous dangers.</s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c11.s30">For poor little Maggie had at once the timidity of an active imagination and the daring that comes from overmastering impulse.</s> <s sid="31" id="mill.c11.s31">She had rushed into the adventure of seeking her unknown kindred, the gypsies; and now she was in this strange lane, she hardly dared look on one side of her, lest she should see the diabolical blacksmith in his leathern apron grinning at her with arms akimbo.</s> <s sid="32" id="mill.c11.s32">It was not without a leaping of the heart that she caught sight of a small pair of bare legs sticking up, feet uppermost, by the side of a hillock; they seemed something hideously preternatural,--a diabolical kind of fungus; for she was too much agitated at the first glance to see the ragged clothes and the dark shaggy head attached to them.</s> <s sid="33" id="mill.c11.s33">It was a boy asleep, and Maggie trotted along faster and more lightly, lest she should wake him; it did not occur to her that he was one of her friends the gypsies, who in all probability would have very genial manners.</s> <s sid="34" id="mill.c11.s34">But the fact was so, for at the next bend in the lane Maggie actually saw the little semicircular black tent with the blue smoke rising before it, which was to be her refuge from all the blighting obloquy that had pursued her in civilized life.</s> <s sid="35" id="mill.c11.s35">She even saw a tall female figure by the column of smoke, doubtless the gypsy-mother, who provided the tea and other groceries; it was astonishing to herself that she did not feel more delighted.</s> <s sid="36" id="mill.c11.s36">But it was startling to find the gypsies in a lane, after all, and not on a common; indeed, it was rather disappointing; for a mysterious illimitable common, where there were sand-pits to hide in, and one was out of everybody's reach, had always made part of Maggie's picture of gypsy life.</s> <s sid="37" id="mill.c11.s37">She went on, however, and thought with some comfort that gypsies most likely knew nothing about idiots, so there was no danger of their falling into the mistake of setting her down at the first glance as an idiot.</s> <s sid="38" id="mill.c11.s38">It was plain she had attracted attention; for the tall figure, who proved to be a young woman with a baby on her arm, walked slowly to meet her.</s> <s sid="39" id="mill.c11.s39">Maggie looked up in the new face rather tremblingly as it approached, and was reassured by the thought that her aunt Pullet and the rest were right when they called her a gypsy; for this face, with the bright dark eyes and the long hair, was really something like what she used to see in the glass before she cut her hair off.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c12.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="mill.c12.s3">It is one of those old, old towns which impress one as a continuation and outgrowth of nature, as much as the nests of the bower-birds or the winding galleries of the white ants; a town which carries the traces of its long growth and history like a millennial tree, and has sprung up and developed in the same spot between the river and the low hill from the time when the Roman legions turned their backs on it from the camp on the hillside, and the long-haired sea-kings came up the river and looked with fierce, eager eyes at the fatness of the land.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c12.s4">It is a town <qs/>"familiar with forgotten years."<qe/></s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c12.s5">The shadow of the Saxon hero-king still walks there fitfully, reviewing the scenes of his youth and love-time, and is met by the gloomier shadow of the dreadful heathen Dane, who was stabbed in the midst of his warriors by the sword of an invisible avenger, and who rises on autumn evenings like a white mist from his tumulus on the hill, and hovers in the court of the old hall by the river-side, the spot where he was thus miraculously slain in the days before the old hall was built.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c12.s6">It was the Normans who began to build that fine old hall, which is, like the town, telling of the thoughts and hands of widely sundered generations; but it is all so old that we look with loving pardon at its inconsistencies, and are well content that they who built the stone oriel, and they who built the Gothic facade and towers of finest small brickwork with the trefoil ornament, and the windows and battlements defined with stone, did not sacreligiously pull down the ancient half-timbered body with its oak-roofed banqueting-hall.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c12.p7" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="mill.c12.s61">Mr. Glegg on his side, too, had a double source of mental occupation, which gave every promise of being inexhaustible.</s> <s sid="62" id="mill.c12.s62">On the one hand, he surprised himself by his discoveries in natural history, finding that his piece of garden-ground contained wonderful caterpillars, slugs, and insects, which, so far as he had heard, had never before attracted human observation; and he noticed remarkable coincidences between these zoological phenomena and the great events of that time,--as, for example, that before the burning of York Minster there had been mysterious serpentine marks on the leaves of the rose-trees, together with an unusual prevalence of slugs, which he had been puzzled to know the meaning of, until it flashed upon him with this melancholy conflagration.</s> <s sid="63" id="mill.c12.s63">(Mr.</s> <s sid="64" id="mill.c12.s64">Glegg had an unusual amount of mental activity, which, when disengaged from the wool business, naturally made itself a pathway in other directions.)</s> <s sid="65" id="mill.c12.s65">And his second subject of meditation was the "contrairiness" of the female mind, as typically exhibited in Mrs. Glegg.</s> <s sid="66" id="mill.c12.s66">That a creature made--in a genealogical sense--out of a man's rib, and in this particular case maintained in the highest respectability without any trouble of her own, should be normally in a state of contradiction to the blandest propositions and even to the most accommodating concessions, was a mystery in the scheme of things to which he had often in vain sought a clew in the early chapters of Genesis.</s> <s sid="67" id="mill.c12.s67">Mr. Glegg had chosen the eldest Miss Dodson as a handsome embodiment of female prudence and thrift, and being himself of a money-getting, money-keeping turn, had calculated on much conjugal harmony.</s> <s sid="68" id="mill.c12.s68">But in that curious compound, the feminine character, it may easily happen that the flavor is unpleasant in spite of excellent ingredients; and a fine systematic stinginess may be accompanied with a seasoning that quite spoils its relish.</s> <s sid="69" id="mill.c12.s69">Now, good Mr. Glegg himself was stingy in the most amiable manner;

his eyes would have watered with true feeling over the sale of a widow's furniture, which a five-pound note from his side pocket would have prevented; but a donation of five pounds to a person "in a small way of life" would have seemed to him a mad kind of lavishness rather than <qs/>"charity,"<qe/> which had always presented itself to him as a contribution of small aids, not a neutralizing of misfortune.</s> <s sid="72" id="mill.c12.s72">And Mr. Glegg was just as fond of saving other people's money as his own; he would have ridden as far round to avoid a turnpike when his expenses were to be paid for him, as when they were to come out of his own pocket, and was quite zealous in trying to induce indifferent acquaintances to adopt a cheap substitute for blacking.</s> <s sid="73" id="mill.c12.s73">This inalienable habit of saving, as an end in itself, belonged to the industrious men of business of a former generation, who made their fortunes slowly, almost as the tracking of the fox belongs to the harrier,--it constituted them a <qs/>"race,"<qe/> which is nearly lost in these days of rapid money-getting, when lavishness comes close on the back of want.</s> <s sid="74" id="mill.c12.s74">In old-fashioned times an "independence" was hardly ever made without a little miserliness as a condition, and you would have found that quality in every provincial district, combined with characters as various as the fruits from which we can extract acid.</s> <s sid="75" id="mill.c12.s75">The true Harpagons were always marked and exceptional characters; not so the worthy tax-payers, who, having once pinched from real necessity, retained even in the midst of their comfortable retirement, with their wallfruit and wine-bins, the habit of regarding life as an ingenious process of nibbling out one's livelihood without leaving any perceptible deficit, and who would have been as immediately prompted to give up a newly taxed luxury when they had had their clear five hundred a year, as when they had only five hundred pounds of capital.</s> <s sid="76" id="mill.c12.s76">Mr. Glegg was one of these men, found so impracticable by chancellors of the exchequer; and knowing this, you will be the better able to understand why he had not swerved from the conviction that he had made an eligible marriage, in spite of the too-pungent seasoning that nature had given to the eldest Miss Dodson's virtues.</s> <s sid="77" id="mill.c12.s77">A man with an affectionate disposition, who finds a wife to concur with his fundamental idea of life, easily comes to persuade himself that no other woman would have suited him so well, and does a little daily snapping and quarrelling without any sense of alienation.</s> <s sid="78" id="mill.c12.s78">Mr. Glegg, being of a reflective turn, and no longer occupied with wool, had much wondering meditation on the peculiar constitution of the female mind as unfolded to him in his domestic life;

nay, even the peculiar combination of grocery and druglike odors in Mrs. Glegg's private cupboard impressed him as the only right thing in the way of cupboard smells.</s> <s sid="80" id="mill.c12.s80">I am not sure that he would not have longed for the quarrelling again, if it had ceased for an entire week;

<p pid="8" id="mill.c12.p8" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="mill.c12.s81">Mr. Glegg's unmistakable kind-heartedness was shown in this, that it pained him more to see his wife at variance with others,--even with Dolly, the servant,--than to be in a state of cavil with her himself; and the quarrel between her and Mr. Tulliver vexed him so much that it quite nullified the pleasure he would otherwise have had in the state of his early cabbages, as he walked in his garden before breakfast the next morning.</s> <s sid="82" id="mill.c12.s82">Still, he went in to breakfast with some slight hope that, now Mrs. Glegg had <qs/>"slept upon it,"<qe/> her anger might be subdued enough to give way to her usually strong sense of family decorum.</s> <s sid="83" id="mill.c12.s83">She had been used to boast that there had never been any of those deadly quarrels among the Dodsons which had disgraced other families; that no Dodson had ever been <qs/>"cut off with a shilling,"<qe/> and no cousin of the Dodsons disowned; as, indeed, why should they be?</s> <s sid="84" id="mill.c12.s84">For they had no cousins who had not money out at use, or some houses of their own, at the very least.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="mill.c12.p33" type="speech"><s sid="149" id="mill.c12.s149">But Mrs. Glegg carried something else up-stairs with her, which, together with the "Saints' Rest" and the gruel, may have had some influence in gradually calming her feelings, and making it possible for her to endure existence on the ground-floor, shortly before tea-time.</s> <s sid="150" id="mill.c12.s150">This was, partly, Mr. Glegg's suggestion that she would do well to let her five hundred lie still until a good investment turned up; and, further, his parenthetic hint at his handsome provision for her in case of his death.</s> <s sid="151" id="mill.c12.s151">Mr. Glegg, like all men of his stamp, was extremely reticent about his will; and Mrs. Glegg, in her gloomier moments, had forebodings that, like other husbands of whom she had heard, he might cherish the mean project of heightening her grief at his death by leaving her poorly off, in which case she was firmly resolved that she would have scarcely any weeper on her bonnet, and would cry no more than if he had been a second husband.</s> <s sid="152" id="mill.c12.s152">But if he had really shown her any testamentary tenderness, it would be affecting to think of him, poor man, when he was gone; and even his foolish fuss about the flowers and garden-stuff, and his insistence on the subject of snails, would be touching when it was once fairly at an end.</s> <s sid="153" id="mill.c12.s153">To survive Mr. Glegg, and talk eulogistically of him as a man who might have his weaknesses, but who had done the right thing by her, not-withstanding his numerous poor relations; to have sums of interest coming in more frequently, and secrete it in various corners, baffling to the most ingenious of thieves (for, to Mrs. Glegg's mind, banks and strong-boxes would have nullified the pleasure of property; she might as well have taken her food in capsules); finally, to be looked up to by her own family and the neighborhood, so as no woman can ever hope to be who has not the praeterite and present dignity comprised in being a <qs/>"widow well left,"<qe/>--all this made a flattering and conciliatory view of the future.</s> <s sid="154" id="mill.c12.s154">So that when good Mr. Glegg, restored to good humor by much hoeing, and moved by the sight of his wife's empty chair, with her knitting rolled up in the corner, went up-stairs to her, and observed that the bell had been tolling for poor Mr. Morton, Mrs. Glegg answered magnanimously, quite as if she had been an uninjured woman:</s> <s sid="155" id="mill.c12.s155"><qs/>"Ah! then, there'll be a good business for somebody to take to."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mill.c13.p8"><s sid="21" id="mill.c13.s21">Mrs. Glegg did not alter her will in consequence of this letter, and cut off the Tulliver children from their sixth and seventh share in her thousand pounds; for she had her principles.</s> <s sid="22" id="mill.c13.s22">No one must be able to say of her when she was dead that she had not divided her money with perfect fairness among her own kin.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c13.s23">In the matter of wills, personal qualities were subordinate to the great fundamental fact of blood; and to be determined in the distribution of your property by caprice, and not make your legacies bear a direct ratio to degrees of kinship, was a prospective disgrace that would have embittered her life.</s> <s sid="24" id="mill.c13.s24">This had always been a principle in the Dodson family; it was one form if that sense of honor and rectitude which was a proud tradition in such families,--a tradition which has been the salt of our provincial society.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c13.p9" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="mill.c13.s25">But though the letter could not shake Mrs. Glegg's principles, it made the family breach much more difficult to mend; and as to the effect it produced on Mrs. Glegg's opinion of Mr. Tulliver, she begged to be understood from that time forth that she had nothing whatever to say about him; his state of mind, apparently, was too corrupt for her to contemplate it for a moment.</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c13.s26">It was not until the evening before Tom went to school, at the beginning of August, that Mrs. Glegg paid a visit to her sister Tulliver, sitting in her gig all the while, and showing her displeasure by markedly abstaining from all advice and criticism; for, as she observed to her sister Deane, <qs/>"Bessy must bear the consequence o' having such a husband, though I'm sorry for her,"<qe/> and Mrs. Deane agreed that Bessy was pitiable.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c13.p10" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="mill.c13.s27">That evening Tom observed to Maggie:</s> <s sid="28" id="mill.c13.s28"><qs/>"Oh my!</s> <s sid="29" id="mill.c13.s29">Maggie, aunt Glegg's beginning to come again; I'm glad I'm going to school.</s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c13.s30">_You'll_ catch it all now!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mill.c13.p11"><s sid="31" id="mill.c13.s31">Maggie was already so full of sorrow at the thought of Tom's going away from her, that this playful exultation of his seemed very unkind, and she cried herself to sleep that night.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mill.c13.p12" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="mill.c13.s32">Mr. Tulliver's prompt procedure entailed on him further promptitude in finding the convenient person who was desirous of lending five hundred pounds on bond.</s> <s sid="33" id="mill.c13.s33"><qs/>"It must be no client of Wakem's,"<qe/> he said to himself; and yet at the end of a fortnight it turned out to the contrary; not because Mr. Tulliver's will was feeble, but because external fact was stronger.</s> <s sid="34" id="mill.c13.s34">Wakem's client was the only convenient person to be found.</s> <s sid="35" id="mill.c13.s35">Mr. Tulliver had a destiny as well as Oedipus, and in this case he might plead, like Oedipus, that his deed was inflicted on him rather than committed by him.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c14.p2"><s sid="2" id="mill.c14.s2">Tom Tulliver'S sufferings during the first quarter he was at King's Lorton, under the distinguished care of the Rev.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c14.s3">Walter Stelling, were rather severe.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c14.s4">At Mr. Jacob's academy life had not presented itself to him as a difficult problem; there were plenty of fellows to play with, and Tom being good at all active games,--fighting especially,--had that precedence among them which appeared to him inseparable from the personality of Tom Tulliver.</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c14.s5">Mr. Jacobs himself, familiarly known as Old Goggles, from his habit of wearing spectacles, imposed no painful awe; and if it was the property of snuffy old hypocrites like him to write like copperplate and surround their signatures with arabesques, to spell without forethought, and to spout "my name is Norval" without bungling, Tom, for his part, was glad he was not in danger of those mean accomplishments.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c14.s6">He was not going to be a snuffy schoolmaster, he, but a substantial man, like his father, who used to go hunting when he was younger, and rode a capital black mare,--as pretty a bit of horse-flesh as ever you saw; Tom had heard what her points were a hundred times.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c14.s7">_He_ meant to go hunting too, and to be generally respected.</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c14.s8">When people were grown up, he considered, nobody inquired about their writing and spelling; when he was a man, he should be master of everything, and do just as he liked.</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c14.s9">It had been very difficult for him to reconcile himself to the idea that his school-time was to be prolonged and that he was not to be brought up to his father's business, which he had always thought extremely pleasant; for it was nothing but riding about, giving orders, and going to market; and he thought that a clergyman would give him a great many Scripture lessons, and probably make him learn the Gospel and Epistle on a Sunday, as well as the Collect.</s> <s sid="10" id="mill.c14.s10">But in the absence of specific information, it was impossible for him to imagine that school and a schoolmaster would be something entirely different from the academy of Mr. Jacobs.</s> <s sid="11" id="mill.c14.s11">So, not to be at a deficiency, in case of his finding genial companions, he had taken care to carry with him a small box of percussion-caps; not that there was anything particular to be done with them, but they would serve to impress strange boys with a sense of his familiarity with guns.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c14.s12">Thus poor Tom, though he saw very clearly through Maggie's illusions, was not without illusions of his own, which were to be cruelly dissipated by his enlarged experience at King's Lorton.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c14.p3"><s sid="13" id="mill.c14.s13">He had not been there a fortnight before it was evident to him that life, complicated not only with the Latin grammar but with a new standard of English pronunciation, was a very difficult business, made all the more obscure by a thick mist of bash fulness.</s> <s sid="14" id="mill.c14.s14">Tom, as you have observed, was never an exception among boys for ease of address; but the difficulty of enunciating a monosyllable in reply to Mr. or Mrs. Stelling was so great, that he even dreaded to be asked at table whether he would have more pudding.</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c14.s15">As to the percussion-caps, he had almost resolved, in the bitterness of his heart, that he would throw them into a neighboring pond; for not only was he the solitary pupil, but he began even to have a certain scepticism about guns, and a general sense that his theory of life was undermined.</s> <s sid="16" id="mill.c14.s16">For Mr. Stelling thought nothing of guns, or horses either, apparently; and yet it was impossible for Tom to despise Mr. Stelling as he had despised Old Goggles.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c14.s17">If there were anything that was not thoroughly genuine about Mr. Stelling, it lay quite beyond Tom's power to detect it; it is only by a wide comparison of facts that the wisest full-grown man can distinguish well-rolled barrels from mere supernal thunder.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c14.p4"><s sid="18" id="mill.c14.s18">Mr. Stelling was a well-sized, broad-chested man, not yet thirty, with flaxen hair standing erect, and large lightish-gray eyes, which were always very wide open; he had a sonorous bass voice, and an air of defiant self-confidence inclining to brazenness.</s> <s sid="19" id="mill.c14.s19">He had entered on his career with great vigor, and intended to make a considerable impression on his fellowmen.</s> <s sid="20" id="mill.c14.s20">The Rev.</s> <s sid="21" id="mill.c14.s21">Walter Stelling was not a man who would remain among the "inferior clergy" all his life.</s> <s sid="22" id="mill.c14.s22">He had a true British determination to push his way in the world,--as a schoolmaster, in the first place, for there were capital masterships of grammar-schools to be had, and Mr. Stelling meant to have one of them; but as a preacher also, for he meant always to preach in a striking manner, so as to have his congregation swelled by admirers from neighboring parishes, and to produce a great sensation whenever he took occasional duty for a brother clergyman of minor gifts.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c14.s23">The style of preaching he had chosen was the extemporaneous, which was held little short of the miraculous in rural parishes like King's Lorton.</s> <s sid="24" id="mill.c14.s24">Some passages of Massillon and Bourdaloue, which he knew by heart, were really very effective when rolled out in Mr. Stelling's deepest tones; but as comparatively feeble appeals of his own were delivered in the same loud and impressive manner, they were often thought quite as striking by his hearers.</s> <s sid="25" id="mill.c14.s25">Mr. Stelling's doctrine was of no particular school; if anything, it had a tinge of evangelicalism, for that was "the telling thing" just then in the diocese to which King's Lorton belonged.</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c14.s26">In short, Mr. Stelling was a man who meant to rise in his profession, and to rise by merit, clearly, since he had no interest beyond what might be promised by a problematic relationship to a great lawyer who had not yet become Lord Chancellor.</s> <s sid="27" id="mill.c14.s27">A clergyman who has such vigorous intentions naturally gets a little into debt at starting; it is not to be expected that he will live in the meagre style of a man who means to be a poor curate all his life; and if the few hundreds Mr. Timpson advanced toward his daughter's fortune did not suffice for the purchase of handsome furniture, together with a stock of wine, a grand piano, and the laying out of a superior flower-garden, it followed in the most rigorous manner, either that these things must be procured by some other means, or else that the Rev.</s> <s sid="28" id="mill.c14.s28">Mr. Stelling must go without them, which last alternative would be an absurd procrastination of the fruits of success, where success was certain.</s> <s sid="29" id="mill.c14.s29">Mr. Stelling was so broad-chested and resolute that he felt equal to anything; he would become celebrated by shaking the consciences of his hearers, and he would by and by edit a Greek play, and invent several new readings.</s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c14.s30">He had not yet selected the play, for having been married little more than two years, his leisure time had been much occupied with attentions to Mrs. Stelling; but he had told that fine woman what he meant to do some day, and she felt great confidence in her husband, as a man who understood everything of that sort.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c14.p5" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="mill.c14.s31">But the immediate step to future success was to bring on Tom Tulliver during this first half-year; for, by a singular coincidence, there had been some negotiation concerning another pupil from the same neighborhood and it might further a decision in Mr. Stelling's favor, if it were understood that young Tulliver, who, Mr. Stelling observed in conjugal privacy, was rather a rough cub, had made prodigious progress in a short time.</s> <s sid="32" id="mill.c14.s32">It was on this ground that he was severe with Tom about his lessons; he was clearly a boy whose powers would never be developed through the medium of the Latin grammar, without the application of some sternness.</s> <s sid="33" id="mill.c14.s33">Not that Mr. Stelling was a harsh-tempered or unkind man; quite the contrary.</s> <s sid="34" id="mill.c14.s34">He was jocose with Tom at table, and corrected his provincialisms and his deportment in the most playful manner; but poor Tom was only the more cowed and confused by this double novelty, for he had never been used to jokes at all like Mr. Stelling's; and for the first time in his life he had a painful sense that he was all wrong somehow.</s> <s sid="35" id="mill.c14.s35">When Mr. Stelling said, as the roast-beef was being uncovered, <qs/>"Now, Tulliver! which would you rather decline, roast-beef or the Latin for it?"<qe/></s> <s sid="36" id="mill.c14.s36">Tom, to whom in his coolest moments a pun would have been a hard nut, was thrown into a state of embarrassed alarm that made everything dim to him except the feeling that he would rather not have anything to do with Latin; of course he answered, <qs/>"Roast-beef,"<qe/><sls/> whereupon there followed much laughter and some practical joking with the plates, from which Tom gathered that he had in some mysterious way refused beef, and, in fact, made himself appear <sle/><qs/>"a silly."<qe/></s> <s sid="37" id="mill.c14.s37">If he could have seen a fellow-pupil undergo these painful operations and survive them in good spirits, he might sooner have taken them as a matter of course.</s> <s sid="38" id="mill.c14.s38">But there are two expensive forms of education, either of which a parent may procure for his son by sending him as solitary pupil to a clergyman: one is the enjoyment of the reverend gentleman's undivided neglect; the other is the endurance of the reverend gentleman's undivided attention.</s> <s sid="39" id="mill.c14.s39">It was the latter privilege for which Mr. Tulliver paid a high price in Tom's initiatory months at King's Lorton.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mill.c14.p6" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="mill.c14.s40">That respectable miller and maltster had left Tom behind, and driven homeward in a state of great mental satisfaction.</s> <s sid="41" id="mill.c14.s41">He considered that it was a happy moment for him when he had thought of asking Riley's advice about a tutor for Tom.</s> <s sid="42" id="mill.c14.s42">Mr. Stelling's eyes were so wide open, and he talked in such an off-hand, matter-of-fact way, answering every difficult, slow remark of Mr. Tulliver's with, "I see, my good sir, I see"; "To be sure, to be sure"; <qs/>"You want your son to be a man who will make his way in the world,"<qe/>--that Mr. Tulliver was delighted to find in him a clergyman whose knowledge was so applicable to the every-day affairs of this life.</s> <s sid="43" id="mill.c14.s43">Except Counsellor Wylde, whom he had heard at the last sessions, Mr. Tulliver thought the Rev.</s> <s sid="44" id="mill.c14.s44">Mr Stelling was the shrewdest fellow he had ever met with,--not unlike Wylde, in fact; he had the same way of sticking his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat.</s> <s sid="45" id="mill.c14.s45">Mr. Tulliver was not by any means an exception in mistaking brazenness for shrewdness; most laymen thought Stelling shrewd, and a man of remarkable powers generally; it was chiefly by his clerical brethren that he was considered rather a full fellow.</s> <s sid="46" id="mill.c14.s46">But he told Mr. Tulliver several stories about "Swing" and incendiarism, and asked his advice about feeding pigs in so thoroughly secular and judicious a manner, with so much polished glibness of tongue, that the miller thought, here was the very thing he wanted for Tom.</s> <s sid="47" id="mill.c14.s47">He had no doubt this first-rate man was acquainted with every branch of information, and knew exactly what Tom must learn in order to become a match for the lawyers, which poor Mr. Tulliver himself did _not_ know, and so was necessarily thrown for self-direction on this wide kind of inference.</s> <s sid="48" id="mill.c14.s48">It is hardly fair to laugh at him, for I have known much more highly instructed persons than he make inferences quite as wide, and not at all wiser.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c14.p7"><s sid="49" id="mill.c14.s49">As for Mrs. Tulliver, finding that Mrs. Stelling's views as to the airing of linen and the frequent recurrence of hunger in a growing boy entirely coincided with her own; moreover, that Mrs. Stelling, though so young a woman, and only anticipating her second confinement, had gone through very nearly the same experience as herself with regard to the behavior and fundamental character of the monthly nurse,--she expressed great contentment to her husband, when they drove away, at leaving Tom with a woman who, in spite of her youth, seemed quite sensible and motherly, and asked advice as prettily as could be.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mill.c14.p8" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="mill.c14.s50"><qs/>"They must be very well off, though,"<qe/><sss/> said Mrs. Tulliver, <sse/><qs/>"for everything's as nice as can be all over the house, and that watered silk she had on cost a pretty penny.</s> <s sid="51" id="mill.c14.s51">Sister Pullet has got one like it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c14.p9" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="mill.c14.s52"><qs/>"Ah,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Tulliver, <sse/><qs/>"he's got some income besides the curacy, I reckon.</s> <s sid="53" id="mill.c14.s53">Perhaps her father allows 'em something.</s> <s sid="54" id="mill.c14.s54">There's Tom 'ull be another hundred to him, and not much trouble either, by his own account; he says teaching comes natural to him.</s> <s sid="55" id="mill.c14.s55">That's wonderful, now,"<qe/> added Mr. Tulliver, turning his head on one side, and giving his horse a meditative tickling on the flank.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c14.p10"><s sid="56" id="mill.c14.s56">Perhaps it was because teaching came naturally to Mr. Stelling, that he set about it with that uniformity of method and independence of circumstances which distinguish the actions of animals understood to be under the immediate teaching of nature.</s> <s sid="57" id="mill.c14.s57">Mr. Broderip's amiable beaver, as that charming naturalist tells us, busied himself as earnestly in constructing a dam, in a room up three pair of stairs in London, as if he had been laying his foundation in a stream or lake in Upper Canada.</s> <s sid="58" id="mill.c14.s58">It was "Binny's" function to build; the absence of water or of possible progeny was an accident for which he was not accountable.</s> <s sid="59" id="mill.c14.s59">With the same unerring instinct Mr. Stelling set to work at his natural method of instilling the Eton Grammar and Euclid into the mind of Tom Tulliver.</s> <s sid="60" id="mill.c14.s60">This, he considered, was the only basis of solid instruction; all other means of education were mere charlatanism, and could produce nothing better than smatterers.</s> <s sid="61" id="mill.c14.s61">Fixed on this firm basis, a man might observe the display of various or special knowledge made by irregularly educated people with a pitying smile; all that sort of thing was very well, but it was impossible these people could form sound opinions.</s> <s sid="62" id="mill.c14.s62">In holding this conviction Mr. Stelling was not biassed, as some tutors have been, by the excessive accuracy or extent of his own scholarship; and as to his views about Euclid, no opinion could have been freer from personal partiality.</s> <s sid="63" id="mill.c14.s63">Mr. Stelling was very far from being led astray by enthusiasm, either religious or intellectual; on the other hand, he had no secret belief that everything was humbug.</s> <s sid="64" id="mill.c14.s64">He thought religion was a very excellent thing, and Aristotle a great authority, and deaneries and prebends useful institutions, and Great Britain the providential bulwark of Protestantism, and faith in the unseen a great support to afflicted minds; he believed in all these things, as a Swiss hotel-keeper believes in the beauty of the scenery around him, and in the pleasure it gives to artistic visitors.</s> <s sid="65" id="mill.c14.s65">And in the same way Mr. Stelling believed in his method of education; he had no doubt that he was doing the very best thing for Mr. Tulliver's boy.</s> <s sid="66" id="mill.c14.s66">Of course, when the miller talked of "mapping" and "summing" in a vague and diffident manner, Mr Stelling had set his mind at rest by an assurance that he understood what was wanted; for how was it possible the good man could form any reasonable judgment about the matter?</s> <s sid="67" id="mill.c14.s67">Mr Stelling's duty was to teach the lad in the only right way,--indeed he knew no other; he had not wasted his time in the acquirement of anything abnormal.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mill.c15.p20"><s sid="61" id="mill.c15.s61">But not even a direct argument from that typical Dodson female herself against his going to law could have heightened his disposition toward it so much as the mere thought of Wakem, continually freshened by the sight of the too able attorney on market-days.</s> <s sid="62" id="mill.c15.s62">Wakem, to his certain knowledge, was (metaphorically speaking) at the bottom of Pivart's irrigation; Wakem had tried to make Dix stand out, and go to law about the dam; it was unquestionably Wakem who had caused Mr. Tulliver to lose the suit about the right of road and the bridge that made a thoroughfare of his land for every vagabond who preferred an opportunity of damaging private property to walking like an honest man along the highroad; all lawyers were more or less rascals, but Wakem's rascality was of that peculiarly aggravated kind which placed itself in opposition to that form of right embodied in Mr. Tulliver's interests and opinions.</s> <s sid="63" id="mill.c15.s63">And as an extra touch of bitterness, the injured miller had recently, in borrowing the five hundred pounds, been obliged to carry a little business to Wakem's office on his own account.</s> <s sid="64" id="mill.c15.s64">A hook-nosed glib fellow! as cool as a cucumber,--always looking so sure of his game!</s> <s sid="65" id="mill.c15.s65">And it was vexatious that Lawyer Gore was not more like him, but was a bald, round-featured man, with bland manners and fat hands; a game-cock that you would be rash to bet upon against Wakem.</s> <s sid="66" id="mill.c15.s66">Gore was a sly fellow.</s> <s sid="67" id="mill.c15.s67">His weakness did not lie on the side of scrupulosity; but the largest amount of winking, however significant, is not equivalent to seeing through a stone wall; and confident as Mr. Tulliver was in his principle that water was water, and in the direct inference that Pivart had not a leg to stand on in this affair of irrigation, he had an uncomfortable suspicion that Wakem had more law to show against this (rationally) irrefragable inference than Gore could show for it.</s> <s sid="68" id="mill.c15.s68">But then, if they went to law, there was a chance for Mr. Tulliver to employ Counsellor Wylde on his side, instead of having that admirable bully against him; and the prospect of seeing a witness of Wakem's made to perspire and become confounded, as Mr. Tulliver's witness had once been, was alluring to the love of retributive justice.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mill.c15.p21"><s sid="69" id="mill.c15.s69">Much rumination had Mr. Tulliver on these puzzling subjects during his rides on the gray horse; much turning of the head from side to side, as the scales dipped alternately; but the probable result was still out of sight, only to be reached through much hot argument and iteration in domestic and social life.</s> <s sid="70" id="mill.c15.s70">That initial stage of the dispute which consisted in the narration of the case and the enforcement of Mr. Tulliver's views concerning it throughout the entire circle of his connections would necessarily take time; and at the beginning of February, when Tom was going to school again, there were scarcely any new items to be detected in his father's statement of the case against Pivart, or any more specific indication of the measures he was bent on taking against that rash contravener of the principle that water was water.</s> <s sid="71" id="mill.c15.s71">Iteration, like friction, is likely to generate heat instead of progress, and Mr. Tulliver's heat was certainly more and more palpable.</s> <s sid="72" id="mill.c15.s72">If there had been no new evidence on any other point, there had been new evidence that Pivart was as "thick as mud" with Wakem.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c17.p4"><s sid="20" id="mill.c17.s20">All this, you remember, happened in those dark ages when there were no schools of design; before schoolmasters were invariably men of scrupulous integrity, and before the clergy were all men of enlarged minds and varied culture.</s> <s sid="21" id="mill.c17.s21">In those less favored days, it is no fable that there were other clergymen besides Mr. Stelling who had narrow intellects and large wants, and whose income, by a logical confusion to which Fortune, being a female as well as blindfold, is peculiarly liable, was proportioned not to their wants but to their intellect, with which income has clearly no inherent relation.</s> <s sid="22" id="mill.c17.s22">The problem these gentlemen had to solve was to readjust the proportion between their wants and their income; and since wants are not easily starved to death, the simpler method appeared to be to raise their income.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c17.s23">There was but one way of doing this; any of those low callings in which men are obliged to do good work at a low price were forbidden to clergymen; was it their fault if their only resource was to turn out very poor work at a high price?</s> <s sid="24" id="mill.c17.s24">Besides, how should Mr. Stelling be expected to know that education was a delicate and difficult business, any more than an animal endowed with a power of boring a hole through a rock should be expected to have wide views of excavation?</s> <s sid="25" id="mill.c17.s25">Mr. Stelling's faculties had been early trained to boring in a straight line, and he had no faculty to spare.</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c17.s26">But among Tom's contemporaries, whose fathers cast their sons on clerical instruction to find them ignorant after many days, there were many far less lucky than Tom Tulliver.</s> <s sid="27" id="mill.c17.s27">Education was almost entirely a matter of luck--usually of ill-luck--in those distant days.</s> <s sid="28" id="mill.c17.s28">The state of mind in which you take a billiard-cue or a dice-box in your hand is one of sober certainty compared with that of old-fashioned fathers, like Mr. Tulliver, when they selected a school or a tutor for their sons.</s> <s sid="29" id="mill.c17.s29">Excellent men, who had been forced all their lives to spell on an impromptu-phonetic system, and having carried on a successful business in spite of this disadvantage, had acquired money enough to give their sons a better start in life than they had had themselves, must necessarily take their chance as to the conscience and the competence of the schoolmaster whose circular fell in their way, and appeared to promise so much more than they would ever have thought of asking for, including the return of linen, fork, and spoon.</s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c17.s30">It was happy for them if some ambitious draper of their acquaintance had not brought up his son to the Church, and if that young gentleman, at the age of four-and-twenty, had not closed his college dissipations by an imprudent marriage; otherwise, these innocent fathers, desirous of doing the best for their offspring, could only escape the draper's son by happening to be on the foundation of a grammar-school as yet unvisited by commissioners, where two or three boys could have, all to themselves, the advantages of a large and lofty building, together with a head-master, toothless, dim-eyed and deaf, whose erudite indistinctness and inattention were engrossed by them at the rate of three hundred pounds a-head,--a ripe scholar, doubtless, when first appointed; but all ripeness beneath the sun has a further stage less esteemed in the market.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mill.c17.p6"><s sid="39" id="mill.c17.s39">The thumb-screw was a little relaxed, however, during this second half-year.</s> <s sid="40" id="mill.c17.s40">Philip was so advanced in his studies, and so apt, that Mr. Stelling could obtain credit by his facility, which required little help, much more easily than by the troublesome process of overcoming Tom's dulness.</s> <s sid="41" id="mill.c17.s41">Gentlemen with broad chests and ambitious intentions do sometimes disappoint their friends by failing to carry the world before them.</s> <s sid="42" id="mill.c17.s42">Perhaps it is that high achievements demand some other unusual qualification besides an unusual desire for high prizes; perhaps it is that these stalwart gentlemen are rather indolent, their _divinae particulum aurae_ being obstructed from soaring by a too hearty appetite.</s> <s sid="43" id="mill.c17.s43">Some reason or other there was why Mr. Stelling deferred the execution of many spirited projects,--why he did not begin the editing of his Greek play, or any other work of scholarship, in his leisure hours, but, after turning the key of his private study with much resolution, sat down to one of Theodore Hook's novels.</s> <s sid="44" id="mill.c17.s44">Tom was gradually allowed to shuffle through his lessons with less rigor, and having Philip to help him, he was able to make some show of having applied his mind in a confused and blundering way, without being cross-examined into a betrayal that his mind had been entirely neutral in the matter.</s> <s sid="45" id="mill.c17.s45">He thought school much more bearable under this modification of circumstances; and he went on contentedly enough, picking up a promiscuous education chiefly from things that were not intended as education at all.</s> <s sid="46" id="mill.c17.s46">What was understood to be his education was simply the practice of reading, writing, and spelling, carried on by an elaborate appliance of unintelligible ideas, and by much failure in the effort to learn by rote.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c17.p7"><s sid="47" id="mill.c17.s47">Nevertheless, there was a visible improvement in Tom under this training; perhaps because he was not a boy in the abstract, existing solely to illustrate the evils of a mistaken education, but a boy made of flesh and blood, with dispositions not entirely at the mercy of circumstances.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mill.c17.p8"><s sid="48" id="mill.c17.s48">There was a great improvement in his bearing, for example; and some credit on this score was due to Mr. Poulter, the village schoolmaster, who, being an old Peninsular soldier, was employed to drill Tom,--a source of high mutual pleasure.</s> <s sid="49" id="mill.c17.s49">Mr. Poulter, who was understood by the company at the Black Swan to have once struck terror into the hearts of the French, was no longer personally formidable.</s> <s sid="50" id="mill.c17.s50">He had rather a shrunken appearance, and was tremulous in the mornings, not from age, but from the extreme perversity of the King's Lorton boys, which nothing but gin could enable him to sustain with any firmness.</s> <s sid="51" id="mill.c17.s51">Still, he carried himself with martial erectness, had his clothes scrupulously brushed, and his trousers tightly strapped; and on the Wednesday and Saturday afternoons, when he came to Tom, he was always inspired with gin and old memories, which gave him an exceptionally spirited air, as of a superannuated charger who hears the drum.</s> <s sid="52" id="mill.c17.s52">The drilling-lessons were always protracted by episodes of warlike narrative, much more interesting to Tom than Philip's stories out of the Iliad; for there were no cannon in the Iliad, and besides, Tom had felt some disgust on learning that Hector and Achilles might possibly never have existed.</s> <s sid="53" id="mill.c17.s53">But the Duke of Wellington was really alive, and Bony had not been long dead; therefore Mr. Poulter's reminiscences of the Peninsular War were removed from all suspicion of being mythical.</s> <s sid="54" id="mill.c17.s54">Mr. Poulter, it appeared, had been a conspicuous figure at Talavera, and had contributed not a little to the peculiar terror with which his regiment of infantry was regarded by the enemy.</s> <s sid="55" id="mill.c17.s55">On afternoons when his memory was more stimulated than usual, he remembered that the Duke of Wellington had (in strict privacy, lest jealousies should be awakened) expressed his esteem for that fine fellow Poulter.</s> <s sid="56" id="mill.c17.s56">The very surgeon who attended him in the hospital after he had received his gunshot-wound had been profoundly impressed with the superiority of Mr. Poulter's flesh,--no other flesh would have healed in anything like the same time.</s> <s sid="57" id="mill.c17.s57">On less personal matters connected with the important warfare in which he had been engaged, Mr. Poulter was more reticent, only taking care not to give the weight of his authority to any loose notions concerning military history.</s> <s sid="58" id="mill.c17.s58">Any one who pretended to a knowledge of what occurred at the siege of Badajos was especially an object of silent pity to Mr. Poulter; he wished that prating person had been run down, and had the breath trampled out of him at the first go-off, as he himself had,--he might talk about the siege of Badajos then!</s> <s sid="59" id="mill.c17.s59">Tom did not escape irritating his drilling-master occasionally, by his curiosity concerning other military matters than Mr. Poulter's personal experience.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mill.c18.p19"><s sid="47" id="mill.c18.s47">Nothing but long meditation and preconcerted arrangement of effects would have enabled Tom to present so striking a figure as he did to Maggie when she looked up.</s> <s sid="48" id="mill.c18.s48">Dissatisfied with the pacific aspect of a face which had no more than the faintest hint of flaxen eyebrow, together with a pair of amiable blue-gray eyes and round pink cheeks that refused to look formidable, let him frown as he would before the looking-glass (Philip had once told him of a man who had a horseshoe frown, and Tom had tried with all his frowning might to make a horseshoe on his forehead), he had had recourse to that unfailing source of the terrible, burnt cork, and had made himself a pair of black eyebrows that met in a satisfactory manner over his nose, and were matched by a less carefully adjusted blackness about the chin.</s> <s sid="49" id="mill.c18.s49">He had wound a red handkerchief round his cloth cap to give it the air of a turban, and his red comforter across his breast as a scarf,--an amount of red which, with the tremendous frown on his brow, and the decision with which he grasped the sword, as he held it with its point resting on the ground, would suffice to convey an approximate idea of his fierce and bloodthirsty disposition.</s> </p>

<title>Chapter VII The Golden Gates Are Passed</title>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c20.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="mill.c20.s1">So Tom went on even to the fifth half-year--till he was turned sixteen--at King's Lorton, while Maggie was growing with a rapidity which her aunts considered highly reprehensible, at Miss Firniss's boarding-school in the ancient town of Laceham on the Floss, with cousin Lucy for her companion.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c20.s2">In her early letters to Tom she had always sent her love to Philip, and asked many questions about him, which were answered by brief sentences about Tom's toothache, and a turf-house which he was helping to build in the garden, with other items of that kind.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c20.s3">She was pained to hear Tom say in the holidays that Philip was as queer as ever again, and often cross.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c20.s4">They were no longer very good friends, she perceived; and when she reminded Tom that he ought always to love Philip for being so good to him when his foot was bad, he answered:</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c20.s5"><qs/>"Well, it isn't my fault; _I_ don't do anything to him."<qe/></s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c20.s6">She hardly ever saw Philip during the remainder of their school-life; in the Midsummer holidays he was always away at the seaside, and at Christmas she could only meet him at long intervals in the street of St.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c20.s7">Ogg's.</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c20.s8">When they did meet, she remembered her promise to kiss him, but, as a young lady who had been at a boarding-school, she knew now that such a greeting was out of the question, and Philip would not expect it.</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c20.s9">The promise was void, like so many other sweet, illusory promises of our childhood; void as promises made in Eden before the seasons were divided, and when the starry blossoms grew side by side with the ripening peach,--impossible to be fulfilled when the golden gates had been passed.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c20.p2" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="mill.c20.s10">But when their father was actually engaged in the long-threatened lawsuit, and Wakem, as the agent at once of Pivart and Old Harry, was acting against him, even Maggie felt, with some sadness, that they were not likely ever to have any intimacy with Philip again; the very name of Wakem made her father angry, and she had once heard him say that if that crook-backed son lived to inherit his father's ill-gotten gains, there would be a curse upon him.</s> <s sid="11" id="mill.c20.s11"><qs/>"Have as little to do with him at school as you can, my lad,"<qe/> he said to Tom; and the command was obeyed the more easily because Mr. Sterling by this time had two additional pupils; for though this gentleman's rise in the world was not of that meteor-like rapidity which the admirers of his extemporaneous eloquence had expected for a preacher whose voice demanded so wide a sphere, he had yet enough of growing prosperity to enable him to increase his expenditure in continued disproportion to his income.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c20.p3"><s sid="12" id="mill.c20.s12">As for Tom's school course, it went on with mill-like monotony, his mind continuing to move with a slow, half-stifled pulse in a medium uninteresting or unintelligible ideas.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c20.s13">But each vacation he brought home larger and larger drawings with the satiny rendering of landscape, and water-colors in vivid greens, together with manuscript books full of exercises and problems, in which the handwriting was all the finer because he gave his whole mind to it.</s> <s sid="14" id="mill.c20.s14">Each vacation he brought home a new book or two, indicating his progress through different stages of history, Christian doctrine, and Latin literature; and that passage was not entirely without results, besides the possession of the books.</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c20.s15">Tom's ear and tongue had become accustomed to a great many words and phrases which are understood to be signs of an educated condition; and though he had never really applied his mind to any one of his lessons, the lessons had left a deposit of vague, fragmentary, ineffectual notions.</s> <s sid="16" id="mill.c20.s16">Mr. Tulliver, seeing signs of acquirement beyond the reach of his own criticism, thought it was probably all right with Tom's education; he observed, indeed, that there were no maps, and not enough "summing"; but he made no formal complaint to Mr. Stelling.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c20.s17">It was a puzzling business, this schooling; and if he took Tom away, where could he send him with better effect?</s> </p>

<title>Chapter I What Had Happened at Home</title>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c21.p1"><s sid="1" id="mill.c21.s1">When Mr. Tulliver first knew the fact that the law-suit was decided against him, and that Pivart and Wakem were triumphant, every one who happened to observe him at the time thought that, for so confident and hot-tempered a man, he bore the blow remarkably well.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c21.s2">He thought so himself; he thought he was going to show that if Wakem or anybody else considered him crushed, they would find themselves mistaken.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c21.s3">He could not refuse to see that the costs of this protracted suit would take more than he possessed to pay them; but he appeared to himself to be full of expedients by which he could ward off any results but such as were tolerable, and could avoid the appearance of breaking down in the world.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c21.s4">All the obstinacy and defiance of his nature, driven out of their old channel, found a vent for themselves in the immediate formation of plans by which he would meet his difficulties, and remain Mr. Tulliver of Dorlcote Mill in spite of them.</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c21.s5">There was such a rush of projects in his brain, that it was no wonder his face was flushed when he came away from his talk with his attorney, Mr. Gore, and mounted his horse to ride home from Lindum.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c21.s6">There was Furley, who held the mortgage on the land,--a reasonable fellow, who would see his own interest, Mr. Tulliver was convinced, and who would be glad not only to purchase the whole estate, including the mill and homestead, but would accept Mr. Tulliver as tenant, and be willing to advance money to be repaid with high interest out of the profits of the business, which would be made over to him, Mr. Tulliver only taking enough barely to maintain himself and his family.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c21.s7">Who would neglect such a profitable investment?</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c21.s8">Certainly not Furley, for Mr. Tulliver had determined that Furley should meet his plans with the utmost alacrity; and there are men whoses brains have not yet been dangerously heated by the loss of a lawsuit, who are apt to see in their own interest or desires a motive for other men's actions.</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c21.s9">There was no doubt (in the miller's mind) that Furley would do just what was desirable; and if he did--why, things would not be so very much worse.</s> <s sid="10" id="mill.c21.s10">Mr. Tulliver and his family must live more meagrely and humbly, but it would only be till the profits of the business had paid off Furley's advances, and that might be while Mr. Tulliver had still a good many years of life before him.</s> <s sid="11" id="mill.c21.s11">It was clear that the costs of the suit could be paid without his being obliged to turn out of his old place, and look like a ruined man.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c21.s12">It was certainly an awkward moment in his affairs.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c21.s13">There was that suretyship for poor Riley, who had died suddenly last April, and left his friend saddled with a debt of two hundred and fifty pounds,--a fact which had helped to make Mr. Tulliver's banking book less pleasant reading than a man might desire toward Christmas.</s> <s sid="14" id="mill.c21.s14">Well! he had never been one of those poor-spirited sneaks who would refuse to give a helping hand to a fellow-traveller in this puzzling world.</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c21.s15">The really vexatious business was the fact that some months ago the creditor who had lent him the five hundred pounds to repay Mrs. Glegg had become uneasy about his money (set on by Wakem, of course), and Mr. Tulliver, still confident that he should gain his suit, and finding it eminently inconvenient to raise the said sum until that desirable issue had taken place, had rashly acceded to the demand that he should give a bill of sale on his household furniture and some other effects, as security in lieu of the bond.</s> <s sid="16" id="mill.c21.s16">It was all one, he had said to himself; he should soon pay off the money, and there was no harm in giving that security any more than another.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c21.s17">But now the consequences of this bill of sale occurred to him in a new light, and he remembered that the time was close at hand when it would be enforced unless the money were repaid.</s> <s sid="18" id="mill.c21.s18">Two months ago he would have declared stoutly that he would never be beholden to his wife's friends; but now he told himself as stoutly that it was nothing but right and natural that Bessy should go to the Pullets and explain the thing to them; they would hardly let Bessy's furniture be sold, and it might be security to Pullet if he advanced the money,--there would, after all, be no gift or favor in the matter.</s> <s sid="19" id="mill.c21.s19">Mr. Tulliver would never have asked for anything from so poor-spirited a fellow for himself, but Bessy might do so if she liked.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c21.p2"><s sid="20" id="mill.c21.s20">It is precisely the proudest and most obstinate men who are the most liable to shift their position and contradict themselves in this sudden manner; everything is easier to them than to face the simple fact that they have been thoroughly defeated, and must begin life anew.</s> <s sid="21" id="mill.c21.s21">And Mr. Tulliver, you perceive, though nothing more than a superior miller and maltster, was as proud and obstinate as if he had been a very lofty personage, in whom such dispositions might be a source of that conspicuous, far-echoing tragedy, which sweeps the stage in regal robes, and makes the dullest chronicler sublime.</s> <s sid="22" id="mill.c21.s22">The pride and obstinacy of millers and other insignificant people, whom you pass unnoticingly on the road every day, have their tragedy too; but it is of that unwept, hidden sort that goes on from generation to generation, and leaves no record,--such tragedy, perhaps, as lies in the conflicts of young souls, hungry for joy, under a lot made suddenly hard to them, under the dreariness of a home where the morning brings no promise with it, and where the unexpectant discontent of worn and disappointed parents weighs on the children like a damp, thick air, in which all the functions of life are depressed; or such tragedy as lies in the slow or sudden death that follows on a bruised passion, though it may be a death that finds only a parish funeral.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c21.s23">There are certain animals to which tenacity of position is a law of life,--they can never flourish again, after a single wrench: and there are certain human beings to whom predominance is a law of life,--they can only sustain humiliation so long as they can refuse to believe in it, and, in their own conception, predominate still.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c21.p3"><s sid="24" id="mill.c21.s24">Mr. Tulliver was still predominating, in his own imagination, as he approached St.</s> <s sid="25" id="mill.c21.s25">Ogg's, through which he had to pass on his way homeward.</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c21.s26">But what was it that suggested to him, as he saw the Laceham coach entering the town, to follow it to the coach-office, and get the clerk there to write a letter, requiring Maggie to come home the very next day?</s> <s sid="27" id="mill.c21.s27">Mr. Tulliver's own hand shook too much under his excitement for him to write himself, and he wanted the letter to be given to the coachman to deliver at Miss Firniss's school in the morning.</s> <s sid="28" id="mill.c21.s28">There was a craving which he would not account for to himself, to have Maggie near him, without delay,--she must come back by the coach to-morrow.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c21.p4"><s sid="29" id="mill.c21.s29">To Mrs. Tulliver, when he got home, he would admit no difficulties, and scolded down her burst of grief on hearing that the lawsuit was lost, by angry assertions that there was nothing to grieve about.</s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c21.s30">He said nothing to her that night about the bill of sale and the application to Mrs. Pullet, for he had kept her in ignorance of the nature of that transaction, and had explained the necessity for taking an inventory of the goods as a matter connected with his will.</s> <s sid="31" id="mill.c21.s31">The possession of a wife conspicuously one's inferior in intellect is, like other high privileges, attended with a few inconveniences, and, among the rest, with the occasional necessity for using a little deception.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c21.p5"><s sid="32" id="mill.c21.s32">The next day Mr. Tulliver was again on horseback in the afternoon, on his way to Mr. Gore's office at St.</s> <s sid="33" id="mill.c21.s33">Ogg's.</s> <s sid="34" id="mill.c21.s34">Gore was to have seen Furley in the morning, and to have sounded him in relation to Mr. Tulliver's affairs.</s> <s sid="35" id="mill.c21.s35">But he had not gone half-way when he met a clerk from Mr. Gore's office, who was bringing a letter to Mr. Tulliver.</s> <s sid="36" id="mill.c21.s36">Mr. Gore had been prevented by a sudden call of business from waiting at his office to see Mr. Tulliver, according to appointment, but would be at his office at eleven to-morrow morning, and meanwhile had sent some important information by letter.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mill.c21.p6" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="mill.c21.s37"><qs/>"Oh!"<qe/> said Mr. Tulliver, taking the letter, but not opening it.</s> <s sid="38" id="mill.c21.s38">"Then tell Gore I'll see him to-morrow at eleven"; and he turned his horse.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c21.p7"><s sid="39" id="mill.c21.s39">The clerk, struck with Mr. Tulliver's glistening, excited glance, looked after him for a few moments, and then rode away.</s> <s sid="40" id="mill.c21.s40">The reading of a letter was not the affair of an instant to Mr. Tulliver; he took in the sense of a statement very slowly through the medium of written or even printed characters; so he had put the letter in his pocket, thinking he would open it in his armchair at home.</s> <s sid="41" id="mill.c21.s41">But by-and-by it occurred to him that there might be something in the letter Mrs. Tulliver must not know about, and if so, it would be better to keep it out of her sight altogether.</s> <s sid="42" id="mill.c21.s42">He stopped his horse, took out the letter, and read it.</s> <s sid="43" id="mill.c21.s43">It was only a short letter; the substance was, that Mr. Gore had ascertained, on secret, but sure authority, that Furley had been lately much straitened for money, and had parted with his securities,--among the rest, the mortgage on Mr. Tulliver's property, which he had transferred to----Wakem.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mill.c21.p8"><s sid="44" id="mill.c21.s44">In half an hour after this Mr. Tulliver's own wagoner found him lying by the roadside insensible, with an open letter near him, and his gray horse snuffing uneasily about him.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c21.p9" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="mill.c21.s45">When Maggie reached home that evening, in obedience to her father's call, he was no longer insensible.</s> <s sid="46" id="mill.c21.s46">About an hour before he had become conscious, and after vague, vacant looks around him, had muttered something about <qs/>"a letter,"<qe/> which he presently repeated impatiently.</s> <s sid="47" id="mill.c21.s47">At the instance of Mr. Turnbull, the medical man, Gore's letter was brought and laid on the bed, and the previous impatience seemed to be allayed.</s> <s sid="48" id="mill.c21.s48">The stricken man lay for some time with his eyes fixed on the letter, as if he were trying to knit up his thoughts by its help.</s> <s sid="49" id="mill.c21.s49">But presently a new wave of memory seemed to have come and swept the other away; he turned his eyes from the letter to the door, and after looking uneasily, as if striving to see something his eyes were too dim for, he said, <qs/>"The little wench."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c21.p10"><s sid="50" id="mill.c21.s50">He repeated the words impatiently from time to time, appearing entirely unconscious of everything except this one importunate want, and giving no sign of knowing his wife or any one else; and poor Mrs. Tulliver, her feeble faculties almost paralyzed by this sudden accumulation of troubles, went backward and forward to the gate to see if the Laceham coach were coming, though it was not yet time.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mill.c21.p11" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="mill.c21.s51">But it came at last, and set down the poor anxious girl, no longer the <qs/>"little wench,"<qe/> except to her father's fond memory.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mill.c21.p13"><s sid="56" id="mill.c21.s56">But Mr. Turnbull came now to meet her; a medical man is the good angel of the troubled house, and Maggie ran toward the kind old friend, whom she remembered as long as she could remember anything, with a trembling, questioning look.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c27.p1"><s sid="1" id="mill.c27.s1">The days passed, and Mr. Tulliver showed, at least to the eyes of the medical man, stronger and stronger symptoms of a gradual return to his normal condition; the paralytic obstruction was, little by little, losing its tenacity, and the mind was rising from under it with fitful struggles, like a living creature making its way from under a great snowdrift, that slides and slides again, and shuts up the newly made opening.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c27.p2"><s sid="2" id="mill.c27.s2">Time would have seemed to creep to the watchers by the bed, if it had only been measured by the doubtful, distant hope which kept count of the moments within the chamber; but it was measured for them by a fast-approaching dread which made the nights come too quickly.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c27.s3">While Mr. Tulliver was slowly becoming himself again, his lot was hastening toward its moment of most palpable change.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c27.s4">The taxing-masters had done their work like any respectable gunsmith conscientiously preparing the musket, that, duly pointed by a brave arm, will spoil a life or two.</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c27.s5">Allocaturs, filing of bills in Chancery, decrees of sale, are legal chain-shot or bomb-shells that can never hit a solitary mark, but must fall with widespread shattering.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c27.s6">So deeply inherent is it in this life of ours that men have to suffer for each other's sins, so inevitably diffusive is human suffering, that even justice makes its victims, and we can conceive no retribution that does not spread beyond its mark in pulsations of unmerited pain.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c27.p3" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="mill.c27.s7">By the beginning of the second week in January, the bills were out advertising the sale, under a decree of Chancery, of Mr. Tulliver's farming and other stock, to be followed by a sale of the mill and land, held in the proper after-dinner hour at the Golden Lion.</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c27.s8">The miller himself, unaware of the lapse of time, fancied himself still in that first stage of his misfortunes when expedients might be thought of; and often in his conscious hours talked in a feeble, disjointed manner of plans he would carry out when he <qs/>"got well."<qe/></s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c27.s9">The wife and children were not without hope of an issue that would at least save Mr. Tulliver from leaving the old spot, and seeking an entirely strange life.</s> <s sid="10" id="mill.c27.s10">For uncle Deane had been induced to interest himself in this stage of the business.</s> <s sid="11" id="mill.c27.s11">It would not, he acknowledged, be a bad speculation for Guest &amp; Co. to buy Dorlcote Mill, and carry on the business, which was a good one, and might be increased by the addition of steam power; in which case Tulliver might be retained as manager.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c27.s12">Still, Mr. Deane would say nothing decided about the matter; the fact that Wakem held the mortgage on the land might put it into his head to bid for the whole estate, and further, to outbid the cautious firm of Guest &amp;Co., who did not carry on business on sentimental grounds.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c27.s13">Mr. Deane was obliged to tell Mrs. Tulliver something to that effect, when he rode over to the mill to inspect the books in company with Mrs. Glegg; for she had observed that <qs/>"if Guest &amp;Co. would only think about it, Mr. Tulliver's father and grandfather had been carrying on Dorlcote Mill long before the oil-mill of that firm had been so much as thought of."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c27.p4"><s sid="14" id="mill.c27.s14">Mr. Deane, in reply, doubted whether that was precisely the relation between the two mills which would determine their value as investments.</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c27.s15">As for uncle Glegg, the thing lay quite beyond his imagination; the good-natured man felt sincere pity for the Tulliver family, but his money was all locked up in excellent mortgages, and he could run no risk; that would be unfair to his own relatives; but he had made up his mind that Tulliver should have some new flannel waistcoats which he had himself renounced in favor of a more elastic commodity, and that he would buy Mrs. Tulliver a pound of tea now and then; it would be a journey which his benevolence delighted in beforehand, to carry the tea and see her pleasure on being assured it was the best black.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c27.p5"><s sid="16" id="mill.c27.s16">Still, it was clear that Mr. Deane was kindly disposed toward the Tullivers.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c27.s17">One day he had brought Lucy, who was come home for the Christmas holidays, and the little blond angel-head had pressed itself against Maggie's darker cheek with many kisses and some tears.</s> <s sid="18" id="mill.c27.s18">These fair slim daughters keep up a tender spot in the heart of many a respectable partner in a respectable firm, and perhaps Lucy's anxious, pitying questions about her poor cousins helped to make uncle Deane more prompt in finding Tom a temporary place in the warehouse, and in putting him in the way of getting evening lessons in book-keeping and calculation.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mill.c27.p6" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="mill.c27.s19">That might have cheered the lad and fed his hopes a little, if there had not come at the same time the much-dreaded blow of finding that his father must be a bankrupt, after all; at least, the creditors must be asked to take less than their due, which to Tom's untechnical mind was the same thing as bankruptcy.</s> <s sid="20" id="mill.c27.s20">His father must not only be said to have <qs/>"lost his property,"<qe/><sss/> but to have <sse/><qs/>"failed,"<qe/>--the word that carried the worst obloquy to Tom's mind.</s> <s sid="21" id="mill.c27.s21">For when the defendant's claim for costs had been satisfied, there would remain the friendly bill of Mr. Gore, and the deficiency at the bank, as well as the other debts which would make the assets shrink into unequivocal disproportion; <qs/>"not more than ten or twelve shillings in the pound,"<qe/> predicted Mr. Deane, in a decided tone, tightening his lips; and the words fell on Tom like a scalding liquied, leaving a continual smart.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c27.p7"><s sid="22" id="mill.c27.s22">He was sadly in want of something to keep up his spirits a little in the unpleasant newness of his position,--suddenly transported from the easy carpeted _ennui_ of study-hours at Mr. Stelling's, and the busy idleness of castle-building in a "last half" at school, to the companionship of sacks and hides, and bawling men thundering down heavy weights at his elbow.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c27.s23">The first step toward getting on in the world was a chill, dusty, noisy affair, and implied going without one's tea in order to stay in St.</s> <s sid="24" id="mill.c27.s24">Ogg's and have an evening lesson from a one-armed elderly clerk, in a room smelling strongly of bad tobacco.</s> <s sid="25" id="mill.c27.s25">Tom's young pink-and-white face had its colors very much deadened by the time he took off his hat at home, and sat down with keen hunger to his supper.</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c27.s26">No wonder he was a little cross if his mother or Maggie spoke to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mill.c27.p8" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="mill.c27.s27">But all this while Mrs. Tulliver was brooding over a scheme by which she, and no one else, would avert the result most to be dreaded, and prevent Wakem from entertaining the purpose of bidding for the mill.</s> <s sid="28" id="mill.c27.s28">Imagine a truly respectable and amiable hen, by some portentous anomaly, taking to reflection and inventing combinations by which she might prevail on Hodge not to wring her neck, or send her and her chicks to market; the result could hardly be other than much cackling and fluttering.</s> <s sid="29" id="mill.c27.s29">Mrs. Tulliver, seeing that everything had gone wrong, had begun to think she had been too passive in life; and that, if she had applied her mind to business, and taken a strong resolution now and then, it would have been all the better for her and her family.</s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c27.s30">Nobody, it appeared, had thought of going to speak to Wakem on this business of the mill; and yet, Mrs. Tulliver reflected, it would have been quite the shortest method of securing the right end.</s> <s sid="31" id="mill.c27.s31">It would have been of no use, to be sure, for Mr. Tulliver to go,--even if he had been able and willing,--for he had been "going to law against Wakem" and abusing him for the last ten years; Wakem was always likely to have a spite against him.</s> <s sid="32" id="mill.c27.s32">And now that Mrs. Tulliver had come to the conclusion that her husband was very much in the wrong to bring her into this trouble, she was inclined to think that his opinion of Wakem was wrong too.</s> <s sid="33" id="mill.c27.s33">To be sure, Wakem had "put the bailies in the house, and sold them up"; but she supposed he did that to please the man that lent Mr. Tulliver the money, for a lawyer had more folks to please than one, and he wasn't likely to put Mr. Tulliver, who had gone to law with him, above everybody else in the world.</s> <s sid="34" id="mill.c27.s34">The attorney might be a very reasonable man; why not?</s> <s sid="35" id="mill.c27.s35">He had married a Miss Clint, and at the time Mrs. Tulliver had heard of that marriage, the summer when she wore her blue satin spencer, and had not yet any thoughts of Mr. Tulliver, she knew no harm of Wakem.</s> <s sid="36" id="mill.c27.s36">And certainly toward herself, whom he knew to have been a Miss Dodson, it was out of all possibility that he could entertain anything but good-will, when it was once brought home to his observation that she, for her part, had never wanted to go to law, and indeed was at present disposed to take Mr. Wakem's view of all subjects rather than her husband's.</s> <s sid="37" id="mill.c27.s37">In fact, if that attorney saw a respectable matron like herself disposed <qs/>"to give him good words,"<qe/> why shouldn't he listen to her representations?</s> <s sid="38" id="mill.c27.s38">For she would put the matter clearly before him, which had never been done yet.</s> <s sid="39" id="mill.c27.s39">And he would never go and bid for the mill on purpose to spite her, an innocent woman, who thought it likely enough that she had danced with him in their youth at Squire Darleigh's, for at those big dances she had often and often danced with young men whose names she had forgotten.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c27.p9" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="mill.c27.s40">Mrs. Tulliver hid these reasonings in her own bosom; for when she had thrown out a hint to Mr. Deane and Mr. Glegg that she wouldn't mind going to speak to Wakem herself, they had said, <qs/>"No, no, no,"<qe/><sss/> and <sse/><qs/>"Pooh, pooh,"<qe/><sss/> and <sse/><qs/>"Let Wakem alone,"<qe/> in the tone of men who were not likely to give a candid attention to a more definite exposition of her project; still less dared she mention the plan to Tom and Maggie, for "the children were always so against everything their mother said"; and Tom, she observed, was almost as much set against Wakem as his father was.</s> <s sid="41" id="mill.c27.s41">But this unusual concentration of thought naturally gave Mrs. Tulliver an unusual power of device and determination: and a day or two before the sale, to be held at the Golden Lion, when there was no longer any time to be lost, she carried out her plan by a stratagem.</s> <s sid="42" id="mill.c27.s42">There were pickles in question, a large stock of pickles and ketchup which Mrs. Tulliver possessed, and which Mr. Hyndmarsh, the grocer, would certainly purchase if she could transact the business in a personal interview, so she would walk with Tom to St.</s> <s sid="43" id="mill.c27.s43">Ogg's that morning; and when Tom urged that she might let the pickles be at present,--he didn't like her to go about just yet,--she appeared so hurt at this conduct in her son, contradicting her about pickles which she had made after the family receipts inherited from his own grandmother, who had died when his mother was a little girl, that he gave way, and they walked together until she turned toward Danish Street, where Mr. Hyndmarsh retailed his grocery, not far from the offices of Mr. Wakem.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c27.p10"><s sid="44" id="mill.c27.s44">That gentleman was not yet come to his office; would Mrs. Tulliver sit down by the fire in his private room and wait for him?</s> <s sid="45" id="mill.c27.s45">She had not long to wait before the punctual attorney entered, knitting his brow with an examining glance at the stout blond woman who rose, curtsying deferentially,--a tallish man, with an aquiline nose and abundant iron-gray hair.</s> <s sid="46" id="mill.c27.s46">You have never seen Mr. Wakem before, and are possibly wondering whether he was really as eminent a rascal, and as crafty, bitter an enemy of honest humanity in general, and of Mr. Tulliver in particular, as he is represented to be in that eidolon or portrait of him which we have seen to exist in the miller's mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mill.c27.p11"><s sid="47" id="mill.c27.s47">It is clear that the irascible miller was a man to interpret any chance-shot that grazed him as an attempt on his own life, and was liable to entanglements in this puzzling world, which, due consideration had to his own infallibility, required the hypothesis of a very active diabolical agency to explain them.</s> <s sid="48" id="mill.c27.s48">It is still possible to believe that the attorney was not more guilty toward him than an ingenious machine, which performs its work with much regularity, is guilty toward the rash man who, venturing too near it, is caught up by some fly-wheel or other, and suddenly converted into unexpected mince-meat.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mill.c27.p12"><s sid="49" id="mill.c27.s49">But it is really impossible to decide this question by a glance at his person; the lines and lights of the human countenance are like other symbols,--not always easy to read without a key.</s> <s sid="50" id="mill.c27.s50">On an _a priori_ view of Wakem's aquiline nose, which offended Mr. Tulliver, there was not more rascality than in the shape of his stiff shirt-collar, though this too along with his nose, might have become fraught with damnatory meaning when once the rascality was ascertained.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c29.p2"><s sid="6" id="mill.c29.s6">He had led an easy life, ordering much and working little, and had no aptitude for any new business.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c29.s7">He must perhaps take to day-labor, and his wife must have help from her sisters,--a prospect doubly bitter to him, now they had let all Bessy's precious things be sold, probably because they liked to set her against him, by making her feel that he had brought her to that pass.</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c29.s8">He listened to their admonitory talk, when they came to urge on him what he was bound to do for poor Bessy's sake, with averted eyes, that every now and then flashed on them furtively when their backs were turned.</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c29.s9">Nothing but the dread of needing their help could have made it an easier alternative to take their advice.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c29.p3"><s sid="10" id="mill.c29.s10">But the strongest influence of all was the love of the old premises where he had run about when he was a boy, just as Tom had done after him.</s> <s sid="11" id="mill.c29.s11">The Tullivers had lived on this spot for generations, and he had sat listening on a low stool on winter evenings while his father talked of the old half-timbered mill that had been there before the last great floods which damaged it so that his grandfather pulled it down and built the new one.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c29.s12">It was when he got able to walk about and look at all the old objects that he felt the strain of his clinging affection for the old home as part of his life, part of himself.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c29.s13">He couldn't bear to think of himself living on any other spot than this, where he knew the sound of every gate door, and felt that the shape and color of every roof and weather-stain and broken hillock was good, because his growing senses had been fed on them.</s> <s sid="14" id="mill.c29.s14">Our instructed vagrancy, which was hardly time to linger by the hedgerows, but runs away early to the tropics, and is at home with palms and banyans,--which is nourished on books of travel and stretches the theatre of its imagination to the Zambesi,--can hardly get a dim notion of what an old-fashioned man like Tulliver felt for this spot, where all his memories centred, and where life seemed like a familiar smooth-handled tool that the fingers clutch with loving ease.</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c29.s15">And just now he was living in that freshened memory of the far-off time which comes to us in the passive hours of recovery from sickness.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c29.p5"><s sid="18" id="mill.c29.s18">Then he turned round, and leaning against the gate-post, looked at the opposite buildings.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c29.p7" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="mill.c29.s22"><qs/>"Ay, sir,"<qe/><sls/> said Luke, with soothing sympathy, <sle/><qs/>"what wi' the rust on the wheat, an' the firin' o' the ricks an' that, as I've seen i' my time,--things often looks comical; there's the bacon fat wi' our last pig run away like butter,--it leaves nought but a scratchin'."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c29.p9" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="mill.c29.s33"><qs/>"Ay, sir,"<qe/><sss/> said Luke, <sse/><qs/>"you'd be a deal better here nor in some new place.</s> <s sid="34" id="mill.c29.s34">I can't abide new places mysen: things is allays awk'ard,--narrow-wheeled waggins, belike, and the stiles all another sort, an' oat-cake i' some places, tow'rt th' head o' the Floss, there.</s> <s sid="35" id="mill.c29.s35">It's poor work, changing your country-side."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c29.p10" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="mill.c29.s36"><qs/>"But I doubt, Luke, they'll be for getting rid o' Ben, and making you do with a lad; and I must help a bit wi' the mill.</s> <s sid="37" id="mill.c29.s37">You'll have a worse place."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mill.c29.p11" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="mill.c29.s38"><qs/>"Ne'er mind, sir,"<qe/><sss/> said Luke, <sse/><qs/>"I sha'n't plague mysen.</s> <s sid="39" id="mill.c29.s39">I'n been wi' you twenty year, an' you can't get twenty year wi' whistlin' for 'em, no more nor you can make the trees grow: you mun wait till God A'mighty sends 'em.</s> <s sid="40" id="mill.c29.s40">I can't abide new victual nor new faces, _I_ can't,--you niver know but what they'll gripe you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mill.c29.p12"><s sid="41" id="mill.c29.s41">The walk was finished in silence after this, for Luke had disburthened himself of thoughts to an extent that left his conversational resources quite barren, and Mr. Tulliver had relapsed from his recollections into a painful meditation on the choice of hardships before him.</s> <s sid="42" id="mill.c29.s42">Maggie noticed that he was unusually absent that evening at tea; and afterward he sat leaning forward in his chair, looking at the ground, moving his lips, and shaking his head from time to time.</s> <s sid="43" id="mill.c29.s43">Then he looked hard at Mrs. Tulliver, who was knitting opposite him, then at Maggie, who, as she bent over her sewing, was intensely conscious of some drama going forward in her father's mind.</s> <s sid="44" id="mill.c29.s44">Suddenly he took up the poker and broke the large coal fiercely.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mill.c29.p18"><s sid="54" id="mill.c29.s54">Maggie obeyed, wondering; but her father gave no further orders, and only sat listening for Tom's footfall on the gravel, apparently irritated by the wind, which had risen, and was roaring so as to drown all other sounds.</s> <s sid="55" id="mill.c29.s55">There was a strange light in his eyes that rather frightened Maggie; _she_ began to wish that Tom would come, too.</s> </p>

<title>Chapter I A Variation of Protestantism Unknown to Bossuet</title>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c30.p1"><s sid="1" id="mill.c30.s1">Journeying down the Rhone on a summer's day, you have perhaps felt the sunshine made dreary by those ruined villages which stud the banks in certain parts of its course, telling how the swift river once rose, like an angry, destroying god, sweeping down the feeble generations whose breath is in their nostrils, and making their dwellings a desolation.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c30.s2">Strange contrast, you may have thought, between the effect produced on us by these dismal remnants of commonplace houses, which in their best days were but the sign of a sordid life, belonging in all its details to our own vulgar era, and the effect produced by those ruins on the castled Rhine, which have crumbled and mellowed into such harmony with the green and rocky steeps that they seem to have a natural fitness, like the mountain-pine; nay, even in the day when they were built they must have had this fitness, as if they had been raised by an earth-born race, who had inherited from their mighty parent a sublime instinct of form.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c30.s3">And that was a day of romance; If those robber-barons were somewhat grim and drunken ogres, they had a certain grandeur of the wild beast in them,--they were forest boars with tusks, tearing and rending, not the ordinary domestic grunter; they represented the demon forces forever in collision with beauty, virtue, and the gentle uses of life; they made a fine contrast in the picture with the wandering minstrel, the soft-lipped princess, the pious recluse, and the timid Israelite.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c30.s4">That was a time of color, when the sunlight fell on glancing steel and floating banners; a time of adventure and fierce struggle,--nay, of living, religious art and religious enthusiasm; for were not cathedrals built in those days, and did not great emperors leave their Western palaces to die before the infidel strongholds in the sacred East?</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c30.s5">Therefore it is that these Rhine castles thrill me with a sense of poetry; they belong to the grand historic life of humanity, and raise up for me the vision of an echo.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c30.s6">But these dead-tinted, hollow-eyed, angular skeletons of villages on the Rhone oppress me with the feeling that human life--very much of it--is a narrow, ugly, grovelling existence, which even calamity does not elevate, but rather tends to exhibit in all its bare vulgarity of conception; and I have a cruel conviction that the lives these ruins are the traces of were part of a gross sum of obscure vitality, that will be swept into the same oblivion with the generations of ants and beavers.</s> </p>

requiring nothing less than a wide and arduous national life condensed in unfragrant deafening factories, cramping itself in mines, sweating at furnaces, grinding, hammering, weaving under more or less oppression of carbonic acid, or else, spread over sheepwalks, and scattered in lonely houses and huts on the clayey or chalky corn-lands, where the rainy days look dreary.</s> <s sid="155" id="mill.c32.s155">This wide national life is based entirely on emphasis,--the emphasis of want, which urges it into all the activities necessary for the maintenance of good society and light irony;

but the rest require something that good society calls <qs/>"enthusiasm,"<qe/> something that will present motives in an entire absence of high prizes; something that will give patience and feed human love when the limbs ache with weariness, and human looks are hard upon us; something, clearly, that lies outside personal desires, that includes resignation for ourselves and active love for what is not ourselves.</s> <s sid="158" id="mill.c32.s158">Now and then that sort of enthusiasm finds a far-echoing voice that comes from an experience springing out of the deepest need; and it was by being brought within the long lingering vibrations of such a voice that Maggie, with her girl's face and unnoted sorrows, found an effort and a hope that helped her through years of loneliness, making out a faith for herself without the aid of established authorities and appointed guides; for they were not at hand, and her need was pressing.</s> <s sid="159" id="mill.c32.s159">From what you know of her, you will not be surprised that she threw some exaggeration and wilfulness, some pride and impetuosity, even into her self-renunciation; her own life was still a drama for her, in which she demanded of herself that her part should be played with intensity.</s> <s sid="160" id="mill.c32.s160">And so it came to pass that she often lost the spirit of humility by being excessive in the outward act; she often strove after too high a flight, and came down with her poor little half-fledged wings dabbled in the mud.</s> <s sid="161" id="mill.c32.s161">For example, she not only determined to work at plain sewing, that she might contribute something toward the fund in the tin box, but she went, in the first instance, in her zeal of self-mortification, to ask for it at a linen shop in St.</s> <s sid="162" id="mill.c32.s162">Ogg's, instead of getting it in a more quiet and indirect way;

but Maggie held it as dross, overlooking the grains of gold, and took Tom's rebuke as one of her outward crosses.</s> <s sid="165" id="mill.c32.s165">Tom was very hard to her, she used to think, in her long night-watchings,--to her who had always loved him so; and then she strove to be contented with that hardness, and to require nothing.</s> <s sid="166" id="mill.c32.s166">That is the path we all like when we set out on our abandonment of egoism,--the path of martyrdom and endurance, where the palm-branches grow, rather than the steep highway of tolerance, just allowance, and self-blame, where there are no leafy honors to be gathered and worn.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c33.p1"><s sid="1" id="mill.c33.s1">The family sitting-room was a long room with a window at each end; one looking toward the croft and along the Ripple to the banks of the Floss, the other into the mill-yard.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c33.s2">Maggie was sitting with her work against the latter window when she saw Mr. Wakem entering the yard, as usual, on his fine black horse; but not alone, as usual.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c33.s3">Some one was with him,--a figure in a cloak, on a handsome pony.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c33.s4">Maggie had hardly time to feel that it was Philip come back, before they were in front of the window, and he was raising his hat to her; while his father, catching the movement by a side-glance, looked sharply round at them both.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c33.p2"><s sid="5" id="mill.c33.s5">Maggie hurried away from the window and carried her work upstairs; for Mr. Wakem sometimes came in and inspected the books, and Maggie felt that the meeting with Philip would be robbed of all pleasure in the presence of the two fathers.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c33.s6">Some day, perhaps, she could see him when they could just shake hands, and she could tell him that she remembered his goodness to Tom, and the things he had said to her in the old days, though they could never be friends any more.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c33.s7">It was not at all agitating to Maggie to see Philip again; she retained her childish gratitude and pity toward him, and remembered his cleverness; and in the early weeks of her loneliness she had continually recalled the image of him among the people who had been kind to her in life, often wishing she had him for a brother and a teacher, as they had fancied it might have been, in their talk together.</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c33.s8">But that sort of wishing had been banished along with other dreams that savored of seeking her own will; and she thought, besides, that Philip might be altered by his life abroad,--he might have become worldly, and really not care about her saying anything to him now.</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c33.s9">And yet his face was wonderfully little altered,--it was only a larger, more manly copy of the pale, small-featured boy's face, with the gray eyes, and the boyish waving brown hair; there was the old deformity to awaken the old pity; and after all her meditations, Maggie felt that she really _should_ like to say a few words to him.</s> <s sid="10" id="mill.c33.s10">He might still be melancholy, as he always used to be, and like her to look at him kindly.</s> <s sid="11" id="mill.c33.s11">She wondered if he remembered how he used to like her eyes; with that thought Maggie glanced toward the square looking-glass which was condemned to hang with its face toward the wall, and she half started from her seat to reach it down; but she checked herself and snatched up her work, trying to repress the rising wishes by forcing her memory to recall snatches of hymns, until she saw Philip and his father returning along the road, and she could go down again.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c33.p3" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="mill.c33.s12">It was far on in June now, and Maggie was inclined to lengthen the daily walk which was her one indulgence; but this day and the following she was so busy with work which must be finished that she never went beyond the gate, and satisfied her need of the open air by sitting out of doors.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c33.s13">One of her frequent walks, when she was not obliged to go to St.</s> <s sid="14" id="mill.c33.s14">Ogg's, was to a spot that lay beyond what was called the <qs/>"Hill,"<qe/>--an insignificant rise of ground crowned by trees, lying along the side of the road which ran by the gates of Dorlcote Mill.</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c33.s15">Insignificant I call it, because in height it was hardly more than a bank; but there may come moments when Nature makes a mere bank a means toward a fateful result; and that is why I ask you to imagine this high bank crowned with trees, making an uneven wall for some quarter of a mile along the left side of Dorlcote Mill and the pleasant fields behind it, bounded by the murmuring Ripple.</s> <s sid="16" id="mill.c33.s16">Just where this line of bank sloped down again to the level, a by-road turned off and led to the other side of the rise, where it was broken into very capricious hollows and mounds by the working of an exhausted stone-quarry, so long exhausted that both mounds and hollows were now clothed with brambles and trees, and here and there by a stretch of grass which a few sheep kept close-nibbled.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c33.s17">In her childish days Maggie held this place, called the Red Deeps, in very great awe, and needed all her confidence in Tom's bravery to reconcile her to an excursion thither,--visions of robbers and fierce animals haunting every hollow.</s> <s sid="18" id="mill.c33.s18">But now it had the charm for her which any broken ground, any mimic rock and ravine, have for the eyes that rest habitually on the level; especially in summer, when she could sit on a grassy hollow under the shadow of a branching ash, stooping aslant from the steep above her, and listen to the hum of insects, like tiniest bells on the garment of Silence, or see the sunlight piercing the distant boughs, as if to chase and drive home the truant heavenly blue of the wild hyacinths.</s> <s sid="19" id="mill.c33.s19">In this June time, too, the dog-roses were in their glory, and that was an additional reason why Maggie should direct her walk to the Red Deeps, rather than to any other spot, on the first day she was free to wander at her will,--a pleasure she loved so well, that sometimes, in her ardors of renunciation, she thought she ought to deny herself the frequent indulgence in it.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c33.p4"><s sid="20" id="mill.c33.s20">You may see her now, as she walks down the favorite turning and enters the Deeps by a narrow path through a group of Scotch firs, her tall figure and old lavender gown visible through an hereditary black silk shawl of some wide-meshed net-like material; and now she is sure of being unseen she takes off her bonnet and ties it over her arm.</s> <s sid="21" id="mill.c33.s21">One would certainly suppose her to be farther on in life than her seventeenth year--perhaps because of the slow resigned sadness of the glance from which all search and unrest seem to have departed; perhaps because her broad-chested figure has the mould of early womanhood.</s> <s sid="22" id="mill.c33.s22">Youth and health have withstood well the involuntary and voluntary hardships of her lot, and the nights in which she has lain on the hard floor for a penance have left no obvious trace; the eyes are liquid, the brown cheek is firm and round, the full lips are red.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c33.s23">With her dark coloring and jet crown surmounting her tall figure, she seems to have a sort of kinship with the grand Scotch firs, at which she is looking up as if she loved them well.</s> <s sid="24" id="mill.c33.s24">Yet one has a sense of uneasiness in looking at her,--a sense of opposing elements, of which a fierce collision is imminent; surely there is a hushed expression, such as one often sees in older faces under borderless caps, out of keeping with the resistant youth, which one expects to flash out in a sudden, passionate glance, that will dissipate all the quietude, like a damp fire leaping out again when all seemed safe.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c33.p5"><s sid="25" id="mill.c33.s25">But Maggie herself was not uneasy at this moment.</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c33.s26">She was clamly enjoying the free air, while she looked up at the old fir-trees, and thought that those broken ends of branches were the records of past storms, which had only made the red stems soar higher.</s> <s sid="27" id="mill.c33.s27">But while her eyes were still turned upward, she became conscious of a moving shadow cast by the evening sun on the grassy path before her, and looked down with a startled gesture to see Philip Wakem, who first raised his hat, and then, blushing deeply, came forward to her and put out his hand.</s> <s sid="28" id="mill.c33.s28">Maggie, too, colored with surprise, which soon gave way to pleasure.</s> <s sid="29" id="mill.c33.s29">She put out her hand and looked down at the deformed figure before her with frank eyes, filled for the moment with nothing but the memory of her child's feelings,--a memory that was always strong in her.</s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c33.s30">She was the first to speak.</s> </p>

<title>Chapter II Aunt Glegg Learns the Breadth of Bob's Thumb</title>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c34.p1"><s sid="1" id="mill.c34.s1">While Maggie's life-struggles had lain almost entirely within her own soul, one shadowy army fighting another, and the slain shadows forever rising again, Tom was engaged in a dustier, noisier warfare, grappling with more substantial obstacles, and gaining more definite conquests.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c34.s2">So it has been since the days of Hecuba, and of Hector, Tamer of horses; inside the gates, the women with streaming hair and uplifted hands offering prayers, watching the world's combat from afar, filling their long, empty days with memories and fears; outside, the men, in fierce struggle with things divine and human, quenching memory in the stronger light of purpose, losing the sense of dread and even of wounds in the hurrying ardor of action.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c34.p2"><s sid="3" id="mill.c34.s3">From what you have seen of Tom, I think he is not a youth of whom you would prophesy failure in anything he had thoroughly wished; the wagers are likely to be on his side, notwithstanding his small success in the classics.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c34.s4">For Tom had never desired success in this field of enterprise; and for getting a fine flourishing growth of stupidity there is nothing like pouring out on a mind a good amount of subjects in which it feels no interest.</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c34.s5">But now Tom's strong will bound together his integrity, his pride, his family regrets, and his personal ambition, and made them one force, concentrating his efforts and surmounting discouragements.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c34.s6">His uncle Deane, who watched him closely, soon began to conceive hopes of him, and to be rather proud that he had brought into the employment of the firm a nephew who appeared to be made of such good commercial stuff.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c34.s7">The real kindness of placing him in the warehouse first was soon evident to Tom, in the hints his uncle began to throw out, that after a time he might perhaps be trusted to travel at certain seasons, and buy in for the firm various vulgar commodities with which I need not shock refined ears in this place; and it was doubtless with a view to this result that Mr. Deane, when he expected to take his wine alone, would tell Tom to step in and sit with him an hour, and would pass that hour in much lecturing and catechising concerning articles of export and import, with an occasional excursus of more indirect utility on the relative advantages to the merchants of St.</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c34.s8">Ogg's of having goods brought in their own and in foreign bottoms,--a subject on which Mr. Deane, as a ship-owner, naturally threw off a few sparks when he got warmed with talk and wine.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c34.p3"><s sid="9" id="mill.c34.s9">Already, in the second year, Tom's salary was raised; but all, except the price of his dinner and clothes, went home into the tin box; and he shunned comradeship, lest it should lead him into expenses in spite of himself.</s> <s sid="10" id="mill.c34.s10">Not that Tom was moulded on the spoony type of the Industrious Apprentice; he had a very strong appetite for pleasure,--would have liked to be a Tamer of horses and to make a distinguished figure in all neighboring eyes, dispensing treats and benefits to others with well-judged liberality, and being pronounced one of the finest young fellows of those parts; nay, he determined to achieve these things sooner or later; but his practical shrewdness told him that the means no such achievements could only lie for him in present abstinence and self-denial; there were certain milestones to be passed, and one of the first was the payment of his father's debts.</s> <s sid="11" id="mill.c34.s11">Having made up his mind on that point, he strode along without swerving, contracting some rather saturnine sternness, as a young man is likely to do who has a premature call upon him for self-reliance.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c34.s12">Tom felt intensely that common cause with his father which springs from family pride, and was bent on being irreproachable as a son; but his growing experience caused him to pass much silent criticism on the rashness and imprudence of his father's past conduct; their dispositions were not in sympathy, and Tom's face showed little radiance during his few home hours.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c34.s13">Maggie had an awe of him, against which she struggled as something unfair to her consciousness of wider thoughts and deeper motives; but it was of no use to struggle.</s> <s sid="14" id="mill.c34.s14">A character at unity with itself--that performs what it intends, subdues every counteracting impulse, and has no visions beyond the distinctly possible--is strong by its very negations.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c34.p4"><s sid="15" id="mill.c34.s15">You may imagine that Tom's more and more obvious unlikeness to his father was well fitted to conciliate the maternal aunts and uncles; and Mr. Deane's favorable reports and predictions to Mr. Glegg concerning Tom's qualifications for business began to be discussed amongst them with various acceptance.</s> <s sid="16" id="mill.c34.s16">He was likely, it appeared, to do the family credit without causing it any expense and trouble.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c34.s17">Mrs. Pullet had always thought it strange if Tom's excellent complexion, so entirely that of the Dodsons, did not argue a certainty that he would turn out well; his juvenile errors of running down the peacock, and general disrespect to his aunts, only indicating a tinge of Tulliver blood which he had doubtless outgrown.</s> <s sid="18" id="mill.c34.s18">Mr. Glegg, who had contracted a cautious liking for Tom ever since his spirited and sensible behavior when the execution was in the house, was now warming into a resolution to further his prospects actively,--some time, when an opportunity offered of doing so in a prudent manner, without ultimate loss; but Mrs. Glegg observed that she was not given to speak without book, as some people were; that those who said least were most likely to find their words made good; and that when the right moment came, it would be seen who could do something better than talk.</s> <s sid="19" id="mill.c34.s19">Uncle Pullet, after silent meditation for a period of several lozenges, came distinctly to the conclusion, that when a young man was likely to do well, it was better not to meddle with him.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c34.p5"><s sid="20" id="mill.c34.s20">Tom, meanwhile, had shown no disposition to rely on any one but himself, though, with a natural sensitiveness toward all indications of favorable opinion, he was glad to see his uncle Glegg look in on him sometimes in a friendly way during business hours, and glad to be invited to dine at his house, though he usually preferred declining on the ground that he was not sure of being punctual.</s> <s sid="21" id="mill.c34.s21">But about a year ago, something had occurred which induced Tom to test his uncle Glegg's friendly disposition.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mill.c34.p6"><s sid="22" id="mill.c34.s22">Bob Jakin, who rarely returned from one of his rounds without seeing Tom and Maggie, awaited him on the bridge as he was coming home from St.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c34.s23">Ogg's one evening, that they might have a little private talk.</s> <s sid="24" id="mill.c34.s24">He took the liberty of asking if Mr. Tom had ever thought of making money by trading a bit on his own account.</s> <s sid="25" id="mill.c34.s25">Trading, how?</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c34.s26">Tom wished to know.</s> <s sid="27" id="mill.c34.s27">Why, by sending out a bit of a cargo to foreign ports; because Bob had a particular friend who had offered to do a little business for him in that way in Laceham goods, and would be glad to serve Mr. Tom on the same footing.</s> <s sid="28" id="mill.c34.s28">Tom was interested at once, and begged for full explanation, wondering he had not thought of this plan before.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c34.p7"><s sid="29" id="mill.c34.s29">He was so well pleased with the prospect of a speculation that might change the slow process of addition into multiplication, that he at once determined to mention the matter to his father, and get his consent to appropriate some of the savings in the tin box to the purchase of a small cargo.</s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c34.s30">He would rather not have consulted his father, but he had just paid his last quarter's money into the tin box, and there was no other resource.</s> <s sid="31" id="mill.c34.s31">All the savings were there; for Mr. Tulliver would not consent to put the money out at interest lest he should lose it.</s> <s sid="32" id="mill.c34.s32">Since he had speculated in the purchase of some corn, and had lost by it, he could not be easy without keeping the money under his eye.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mill.c34.p8"><s sid="33" id="mill.c34.s33">Tom approached the subject carefully, as he was seated on the hearth with his father that evening, and Mr. Tulliver listened, leaning forward in his arm-chair and looking up in Tom's face with a sceptical glance.</s> <s sid="34" id="mill.c34.s34">His first impulse was to give a positive refusal, but he was in some awe of Tom's wishes, and since he had the sense of being an "unlucky" father, he had lost some of his old peremptoriness and determination to be master.</s> <s sid="35" id="mill.c34.s35">He took the key of the bureau from his pocket, got out the key of the large chest, and fetched down the tin box,--slowly, as if he were trying to defer the moment of a painful parting.</s> <s sid="36" id="mill.c34.s36">Then he seated himself against the table, and opened the box with that little padlock-key which he fingered in his waistcoat pocket in all vacant moments.</s> <s sid="37" id="mill.c34.s37">There they were, the dingy bank-notes and the bright sovereigns, and he counted them out on the table--only a hundred and sixteen pounds in two years, after all the pinching.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c34.p9" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="mill.c34.s38"><qs/>"How much do you want, then?"<qe/> he said, speaking as if the words burnt his lips.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c34.p10" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="mill.c34.s39"><qs/>"Suppose I begin with the thirty-six pounds, father?"<qe/> said Tom.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mill.c34.p11"><s sid="40" id="mill.c34.s40">Mr. Tulliver separated this sum from the rest, and keeping his hand over it, said:</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mill.c34.p12" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="mill.c34.s41"><qs/>"It's as much as I can save out o' my pay in a year."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mill.c34.p13" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="mill.c34.s42"><qs/>"Yes, father; it is such slow work, saving out of the little money we get.</s> <s sid="43" id="mill.c34.s43">And in this way we might double our savings."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mill.c34.p14" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="mill.c34.s44"><qs/>"Ay, my lad,"<qe/><sls/> said the father, keeping his hand on the money, <sle/><qs/>"but you might lose it,--you might lose a year o' my life,--and I haven't got many."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mill.c34.p15"><s sid="45" id="mill.c34.s45">Tom was silent.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mill.c34.p16" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="mill.c34.s46"><qs/>"And you know I wouldn't pay a dividend with the first hundred, because I wanted to see it all in a lump,--and when I see it, I'm sure on't.</s> <s sid="47" id="mill.c34.s47">If you trust to luck, it's sure to be against me.</s> <s sid="48" id="mill.c34.s48">It's Old Harry's got the luck in his hands; and if I lose one year, I shall never pick it up again; death 'ull o'ertake me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mill.c34.p17"><s sid="49" id="mill.c34.s49">Mr. Tulliver's voice trembled, and Tom was silent for a few minutes before he said:</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mill.c34.p18" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="mill.c34.s50"><qs/>"I'll give it up, father, since you object to it so strongly."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mill.c34.p19"><s sid="51" id="mill.c34.s51">But, unwilling to abandon the scheme altogether, he determined to ask his uncle Glegg to venture twenty pounds, on condition of receiving five per cent. of the profits.</s> <s sid="52" id="mill.c34.s52">That was really a very small thing to ask.</s> <s sid="53" id="mill.c34.s53">So when Bob called the next day at the wharf to know the decision, Tom proposed that they should go together to his uncle Glegg's to open the business; for his diffident pride clung to him, and made him feel that Bobs' tongue would relieve him from some embarrassment.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mill.c34.p20"><s sid="54" id="mill.c34.s54">Mr. Glegg, at the pleasant hour of four in the afternoon of a hot August day, was naturally counting his wall-fruit to assure himself that the sum total had not varied since yesterday.</s> <s sid="55" id="mill.c34.s55">To him entered Tom, in what appeared to Mr. Glegg very questionable companionship,--that of a man with a pack on his back,--for Bob was equipped for a new journey,--and of a huge brindled bull-terrier, who walked with a slow, swaying movement from side to side, and glanced from under his eye-lids with a surly indifference which might after all be a cover to the most offensive designs.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mill.c34.p21"><s sid="56" id="mill.c34.s56">Mr. Glegg's spectacles, which had been assisting him in counting the fruit, made these suspicious details alarmingly evident to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mill.c34.p23" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="mill.c34.s58"><qs/>"Get out wi' you, Mumps,"<qe/> said Bob, with a kick.</s> <s sid="59" id="mill.c34.s59"><qs/>"He's as quiet as a lamb, sir,"<qe/>--an observation which Mumps corroborated by a low growl as he retreated behind his master's legs.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mill.c34.p24" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="mill.c34.s60"><qs/>"Why, what ever does this mean, Tom?"<qe/> said Mr. Glegg.</s> <s sid="61" id="mill.c34.s61"><qs/>"Have you brought information about the scoundrels as cut my trees?"<qe/></s> <s sid="62" id="mill.c34.s62">If Bob came in the character of <qs/>"information,"<qe/> Mr. Glegg saw reasons for tolerating some irregularity.</s> </p>

<title>Chapter VII A Day of Reckoning</title>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c39.p1"><s sid="1" id="mill.c39.s1">Mr. Tulliver was an essentially sober man,--able to take his glass and not averse to it, but never exceeding the bounds of moderation.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c39.s2">He had naturally an active Hotspur temperament, which did not crave liquid fire to set it aglow; his impetuosity was usually equal to an exciting occasion without any such reinforcements; and his desire for the brandy-and-water implied that the too sudden joy had fallen with a dangerous shock on a frame depressed by four years of gloom and unaccustomed hard fare.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c39.s3">But that first doubtful tottering moment passed, he seemed to gather strength with his gathering excitement; and the next day, when he was seated at table with his creditors, his eye kindling and his cheek flushed with the consciousness that he was about to make an honorable figure once more, he looked more like the proud, confident, warm-hearted, and warm-tempered Tulliver of old times than might have seemed possible to any one who had met him a week before, riding along as had been his wont for the last four years since the sense of failure and debt had been upon him,--with his head hanging down, casting brief, unwilling looks on those who forced themselves on his notice.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c39.s4">He made his speech, asserting his honest principles with his old confident eagerness, alluding to the rascals and the luck that had been against him, but that he had triumphed over, to some extent, by hard efforts and the aid of a good son; and winding up with the story of how Tom had got the best part of the needful money.</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c39.s5">But the streak of irritation and hostile triumph seemed to melt for a little while into purer fatherly pride and pleasure, when, Tom's health having been proposed, and uncle Deane having taken occasion to say a few words of eulogy on his general character and conduct, Tom himself got up and made the single speech of his life.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c39.s6">It could hardly have been briefer.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c39.s7">He thanked the gentlmen for the honor they had done him.</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c39.s8">He was glad that he had been able to help his father in proving his integrity and regaining his honest name; and, for his own part, he hoped he should never undo that work and disgrace that name.</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c39.s9">But the applause that followed was so great, and Tom looked so gentlemanly as well as tall and straight, that Mr. Tulliver remarked, in an explanatory manner, to his friends on his right and left, that he had spent a deal of money on his son's education.</s> </p>

<title>Chapter III Confidential Moments</title>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c42.p1"><s sid="1" id="mill.c42.s1">When Maggie went up to her bedroom that night, it appeared that she was not at all inclined to undress.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c42.s2">She set down her candle on the first table that presented itself, and began to walk up and down her room, which was a large one, with a firm, regular, and rather rapid step, which showed that the exercise was the instinctive vent of strong excitement.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c42.s3">Her eyes and cheeks had an almost feverish brilliancy; her head was thrown backward, and her hands were clasped with the palms outward, and with that tension of the arms which is apt to accompany mental absorption.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c42.p2"><s sid="4" id="mill.c42.s4">Had anything remarkable happened?</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c42.p4"><s sid="10" id="mill.c42.s10">In poor Maggie's highly-strung, hungry nature,--just come away from a third-rate schoolroom, with all its jarring sounds and petty round of tasks,--these apparently trivial causes had the effect of rousing and exalting her imagination in a way that was mysterious to herself.</s> <s sid="11" id="mill.c42.s11">It was not that she thought distinctly of Mr. Stephen Guest, or dwelt on the indications that he looked at her with admiration; it was rather that she felt the half-remote presence of a world of love and beauty and delight, made up of vague, mingled images from all the poetry and romance she had ever read, or had ever woven in her dreamy reveries.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c42.s12">Her mind glanced back once or twice to the time when she had courted privation, when she had thought all longing, all impatience was subdued; but that condition seemed irrecoverably gone, and she recoiled from the remembrance of it.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c42.s13">No prayer, no striving now, would bring back that negative peace; the battle of her life, it seemed, was not to be decided in that short and easy way,--by perfect renunciation at the very threshold of her youth.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c42.p5"><s sid="14" id="mill.c42.s14">The music was vibrating in her still,--Purcell's music, with its wild passion and fancy,--and she could not stay in the recollection of that bare, lonely past.</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c42.s15">She was in her brighter aerial world again, when a little tap came at the door; of course it was her cousin, who entered in ample white dressing-gown.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c43.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="mill.c43.s1">Maggie was obliged to go to Tom's lodgings in the middle of the day, when he would be coming in to dinner, else she would not have found him at home.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c43.s2">He was not lodging with entire strangers.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c43.s3">Our friend Bob Jakin had, with Mumps's tacit consent, taken not only a wife about eight months ago, but also one of those queer old houses, pierced with surprising passages, by the water-side, where, as he observed, his wife and mother could keep themselves out of mischief by letting out two <qs/>"pleasure-boats,"<qe/> in which he had invested some of his savings, and by taking in a lodger for the parlor and spare bedroom.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c43.s4">Under these circumstances, what could be better for the interests of all parties, sanitary considerations apart, than that the lodger should be Mr. Tom?</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c43.p2" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="mill.c43.s5">It was Bob's wife who opened the door to Maggie.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c43.s6">She was a tiny woman, with the general physiognomy of a Dutch doll, looking, in comparison with Bob's mother, who filled up the passage in the rear, very much like one of those human figures which the artist finds conveniently standing near a colossal statue to show the proportions.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c43.s7">The tiny woman curtsied and looked up at Maggie with some awe as soon as she had opened the door; but the words, <qs/>"Is my brother at home?"<qe/> which Maggie uttered smilingly, made her turn round with sudden excitement, and say,--</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c43.p3" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="mill.c43.s8"><qs/>"Eh, mother, mother--tell Bob!--it's Miss Maggie!</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c43.s9">Come in, Miss, for goodness do,"<qe/> she went on, opening a side door, and endeavoring to flatten her person against the wall to make the utmost space for the visitor.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c43.p4" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="mill.c43.s10">Sad recollections crowded on Maggie as she entered the small parlor, which was now all that poor Tom had to call by the name of <qs/>"home,"<qe/>--that name which had once, so many years ago, meant for both of them the same sum of dear familiar objects.</s> <s sid="11" id="mill.c43.s11">But everything was not strange to her in this new room; the first thing her eyes dwelt on was the large old Bible, and the sight was not likely to disperse the old memories.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c43.s12">She stood without speaking.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c43.p5" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="mill.c43.s13"><qs/>"If you please to take the privilege o' sitting down, Miss,"<qe/> said Mrs. Jakin, rubbing her apron over a perfectly clean chair, and then lifting up the corner of that garment and holding it to her face with an air of embarrassment, as she looked wonderingly at Maggie.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mill.c43.p6" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="mill.c43.s14"><qs/>"Bob is at home, then?"<qe/> said Maggie, recovering herself, and smiling at the bashful Dutch doll.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c43.p7" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="mill.c43.s15"><qs/>"Yes, Miss; but I think he must be washing and dressing himself; I'll go and see,"<qe/> said Mrs. Jakin, disappearing.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mill.c43.p8"><s sid="16" id="mill.c43.s16">But she presently came back walking with new courage a little way behind her husband, who showed the brilliancy of his blue eyes and regular white teeth in the doorway, bowing respectfully.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c43.p9" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="mill.c43.s17"><qs/>"How do you do, Bob?"<qe/><sls/> said Maggie, coming forward and putting out her hand to him; <sle/><qs/>"I always meant to pay your wife a visit, and I shall come another day on purpose for that, if she will let me.</s> <s sid="18" id="mill.c43.s18">But I was obliged to come to-day to speak to my brother."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c43.p10" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="mill.c43.s19"><qs/>"He'll be in before long, Miss.</s> <s sid="20" id="mill.c43.s20">He's doin' finely, Mr. Tom is; he'll be one o' the first men hereabouts,--you'll see that."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mill.c43.p11" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="mill.c43.s21"><qs/>"Well, Bob, I'm sure he'll be indebted to you, whatever he becomes; he said so himself only the other night, when he was talking of you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mill.c43.p12" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="mill.c43.s22"><qs/>"Eh, Miss, that's his way o' takin' it.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c43.s23">But I think the more on't when he says a thing, because his tongue doesn't overshoot him as mine does.</s> <s sid="24" id="mill.c43.s24">Lors!</s> <s sid="25" id="mill.c43.s25">I'm no better nor a tilted bottle, I ar'n't,--I can't stop mysen when once I begin.</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c43.s26">But you look rarely, Miss; it does me good to see you.</s> <s sid="27" id="mill.c43.s27">What do you say now, Prissy?"<qe/><sls/>--here Bob turned to his wife,--<sle/><qs/>"Isn't it all come true as I said?</s> <s sid="28" id="mill.c43.s28">Though there isn't many sorts o' goods as I can't over-praise when I set my tongue to't."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mill.c43.p13" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="mill.c43.s29">Mrs. Bob's small nose seemed to be following the example of her eyes in turning up reverentially toward Maggie, but she was able now to smile and curtsey, and say, <qs/>"I'd looked forrard like aenything to seein' you, Miss, for my husband's tongue's been runnin' on you, like as if he was light-headed, iver since first he come a-courtin' on me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mill.c43.p14" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="mill.c43.s30"><qs/>"Well, well,"<qe/> said Bob, looking rather silly.</s> <s sid="31" id="mill.c43.s31"><qs/>"Go an' see after the taters, else Mr. Tom 'ull have to wait for 'em."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mill.c43.p15" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="mill.c43.s32"><qs/>"I hope Mumps is friendly with Mrs. Jakin, Bob,"<qe/> said Maggie, smiling.</s> <s sid="33" id="mill.c43.s33"><qs/>"I remember you used to say he wouldn't like your marrying."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mill.c43.p16" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="mill.c43.s34"><qs/>"Eh, Miss,"<qe/><sss/> said Bob, <sse/><qs/>"he made up his mind to't when he see'd what a little un she was.</s> <s sid="35" id="mill.c43.s35">He pretends not to see her mostly, or else to think as she isn't full-growed.</s> <s sid="36" id="mill.c43.s36">But about Mr. Tom, Miss,"<qe/><sls/> said Bob, speaking lower and looking serious, <sle/><qs/>"he's as close as a iron biler, he is; but I'm a 'cutish chap, an' when I've left off carrying my pack, an' am at a loose end, I've got more brains nor I know what to do wi', an' I'm forced to busy myself wi' other folks's insides.</s> <s sid="37" id="mill.c43.s37">An' it worrets me as Mr. Tom'll sit by himself so glumpish, a-knittin' his brow, an' a-lookin' at the fire of a night.</s> <s sid="38" id="mill.c43.s38">He should be a bit livelier now, a fine young fellow like him.</s> <s sid="39" id="mill.c43.s39">My wife says, when she goes in sometimes, an' he takes no notice of her, he sits lookin' into the fire, and frownin' as if he was watchin' folks at work in it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mill.c43.p17" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="mill.c43.s40"><qs/>"He thinks so much about business,"<qe/> said Maggie.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mill.c43.p18" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="mill.c43.s41"><qs/>"Ay,"<qe/><sss/> said Bob, speaking lower; <sse/><qs/>"but do you think it's nothin' else, Miss?</s> <s sid="42" id="mill.c43.s42">He's close, Mr. Tom is; but I'm a 'cute chap, I am, an' I thought tow'rt last Christmas as I'd found out a soft place in him.</s> <s sid="43" id="mill.c43.s43">It was about a little black spaniel--a rare bit o' breed--as he made a fuss to get.</s> <s sid="44" id="mill.c43.s44">But since then summat's come over him, as he's set his teeth again' things more nor iver, for all he's had such good luck.</s> <s sid="45" id="mill.c43.s45">An' I wanted to tell _you_, Miss, 'cause I thought you might work it out of him a bit, now you're come.</s> <s sid="46" id="mill.c43.s46">He's a deal too lonely, and doesn't go into company enough."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mill.c43.p19" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="mill.c43.s47"><qs/>"I'm afraid I have very little power over him, Bob,"<qe/> said Maggie, a good deal moved by Bob's suggestion.</s> <s sid="48" id="mill.c43.s48">It was a totally new idea to her mind that Tom could have his love troubles.</s> <s sid="49" id="mill.c43.s49">Poor fellow!--and in love with Lucy too!</s> <s sid="50" id="mill.c43.s50">But it was perhaps a mere fancy of Bob's too officious brain.</s> <s sid="51" id="mill.c43.s51">The present of the dog meant nothing more than cousinship and gratitude.</s> <s sid="52" id="mill.c43.s52">But Bob had already said, <qs/>"Here's Mr. Tom,"<qe/> and the outer door was opening.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mill.c43.p20" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="mill.c43.s53"><qs/>"There is no time to spare, Tom,"<qe/> said Maggie, as soon as Bob left the room.</s> <s sid="54" id="mill.c43.s54"><qs/>"I must tell you at once what I came about, else I shall be hindering you from taking your dinner."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mill.c43.p21" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="mill.c43.s55">Tom stood with his back against the chimney-piece, and Maggie was seated opposite the light.</s> <s sid="56" id="mill.c43.s56">He noticed that she was tremulous, and he had a presentiment of the subject she was going to speak about.</s> <s sid="57" id="mill.c43.s57">The presentiment made his voice colder and harder as he said, <qs/>"What is it?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mill.c43.p22"><s sid="58" id="mill.c43.s58">This tone roused a spirit of resistance in Maggie, and she put her request in quite a different form from the one she had predetermined on.</s> <s sid="59" id="mill.c43.s59">She rose from her seat, and looking straight at Tom, said,--</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mill.c43.p23" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="mill.c43.s60"><qs/>"I want you to absolve me from my promise about Philip Wakem.</s> <s sid="61" id="mill.c43.s61">Or rather, I promised you not to see him without telling you.</s> <s sid="62" id="mill.c43.s62">I am come to tell you that I wish to see him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mill.c43.p24" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="mill.c43.s63"><qs/>"Very well,"<qe/> said Tom, still more coldly.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="mill.c43.p25"><s sid="64" id="mill.c43.s64">But Maggie had hardly finished speaking in that chill, defiant manner, before she repented, and felt the dread of alienation from her brother.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="mill.c43.p26" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="mill.c43.s65"><qs/>"Not for myself, dear Tom.</s> <s sid="66" id="mill.c43.s66">Don't be angry.</s> <s sid="67" id="mill.c43.s67">I shouldn't have asked it, only that Philip, you know, is a friend of Lucy's and she wishes him to come, has invited him to come this evening; and I told her I couldn't see him without telling you.</s> <s sid="68" id="mill.c43.s68">I shall only see him in the presence of other people.</s> <s sid="69" id="mill.c43.s69">There will never be anything secret between us again."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="mill.c43.p27"><s sid="70" id="mill.c43.s70">Tom looked away from Maggie, knitting his brow more strongly for a little while.</s> <s sid="71" id="mill.c43.s71">Then he turned to her and said, slowly and emphatically,--</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="mill.c43.p28" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="mill.c43.s72"><qs/>"You know what is my feeling on that subject, Maggie.</s> <s sid="73" id="mill.c43.s73">There is no need for my repeating anything I said a year ago.</s> <s sid="74" id="mill.c43.s74">While my father was living, I felt bound to use the utmost power over you, to prevent you from disgracing him as well as yourself, and all of us.</s> <s sid="75" id="mill.c43.s75">But now I must leave you to your own choice.</s> <s sid="76" id="mill.c43.s76">You wish to be independent; you told me so after my father's death.</s> <s sid="77" id="mill.c43.s77">My opinion is not changed.</s> <s sid="78" id="mill.c43.s78">If you think of Philip Wakem as a lover again, you must give up me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="mill.c43.p29" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="mill.c43.s79"><qs/>"I don't wish it, dear Tom, at least as things are; I see that it would lead to misery.</s> <s sid="80" id="mill.c43.s80">But I shall soon go away to another situation, and I should like to be friends with him again while I am here.</s> <s sid="81" id="mill.c43.s81">Lucy wishes it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="mill.c43.p30"><s sid="82" id="mill.c43.s82">The severity of Tom's face relaxed a little.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="mill.c43.p31" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="mill.c43.s83"><qs/>"I shouldn't mind your seeing him occasionally at my uncle's--I don't want you to make a fuss on the subject.</s> <s sid="84" id="mill.c43.s84">But I have no confidence in you, Maggie.</s> <s sid="85" id="mill.c43.s85">You would be led away to do anything."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="mill.c43.p32"><s sid="86" id="mill.c43.s86">That was a cruel word.</s> <s sid="87" id="mill.c43.s87">Maggie's lip began to tremble.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="mill.c43.p33" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="mill.c43.s88"><qs/>"Why will you say that, Tom?</s> <s sid="89" id="mill.c43.s89">It is very hard of you.</s> <s sid="90" id="mill.c43.s90">Have I not done and borne everything as well as I could?</s> <s sid="91" id="mill.c43.s91">And I kept my word to you--when--when----My life has not been a happy one, any more than yours."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="mill.c43.p34"><s sid="92" id="mill.c43.s92">She was obliged to be childish; the tears would come.</s> <s sid="93" id="mill.c43.s93">When Maggie was not angry, she was as dependent on kind or cold words as a daisy on the sunshine or the cloud; the need of being loved would always subdue her, as, in old days, it subdued her in the worm-eaten attic.</s> <s sid="94" id="mill.c43.s94">The brother's goodness came uppermost at this appeal, but it could only show itself in Tom's fashion.</s> <s sid="95" id="mill.c43.s95">He put his hand gently on her arm, and said, in the tone of a kind pedagogue,--</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="mill.c43.p36" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="mill.c43.s106"><qs/>"Yes, I know, dear Tom,"<qe/> said Maggie, still half-sobbing, but trying to control her tears.</s> <s sid="107" id="mill.c43.s107"><qs/>"I know you would do a great deal for me; I know how you work, and don't spare yourself.</s> <s sid="108" id="mill.c43.s108">I am grateful to you.</s> <s sid="109" id="mill.c43.s109">But, indeed, you can't quite judge for me; our natures are very different.</s> <s sid="110" id="mill.c43.s110">You don't know how differently things affect me from what they do you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="mill.c43.p38"><s sid="117" id="mill.c43.s117">There was a terrible cutting truth in Tom's words,--that hard rind of truth which is discerned by unimaginative, unsympathetic minds.</s> <s sid="118" id="mill.c43.s118">Maggie always writhed under this judgment of Tom's; she rebelled and was humiliated in the same moment; it seemed as if he held a glass before her to show her her own folly and weakness, as if he were a prophetic voice predicting her future fallings; and yet, all the while, she judged him in return; she said inwardly that he was narrow and unjust, that he was below feeling those mental needs which were often the source of the wrong-doing or absurdity that made her life a planless riddle to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="mill.c43.p39"><s sid="119" id="mill.c43.s119">She did not answer directly; her heart was too full, and she sat down, leaning her arm on the table.</s> <s sid="120" id="mill.c43.s120">It was no use trying to make Tom feel that she was near to him.</s> <s sid="121" id="mill.c43.s121">He always repelled her.</s> <s sid="122" id="mill.c43.s122">Her feeling under his words was complicated by the allusion to the last scene between her father and Wakem; and at length that painful, solemn memory surmounted the immediate grievance.</s> <s sid="123" id="mill.c43.s123">No!</s> <s sid="124" id="mill.c43.s124">She did not think of such things with frivolous indifference, and Tom must not accuse her of that.</s> <s sid="125" id="mill.c43.s125">She looked up at him with a grave, earnest gaze and said,--</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="mill.c43.p42"><s sid="136" id="mill.c43.s136">There was a little tremor in Tom's voice as he uttered the last words, and Maggie's ready affection came back with as sudden a glow as when they were children, and bit their cake together as a sacrament of conciliation.</s> <s sid="137" id="mill.c43.s137">She rose and laid her hand on Tom's shoulder.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c46.p1"><s sid="1" id="mill.c46.s1">The next morning was very wet,--the sort of morning on which male neighbors who have no imperative occupation at home are likely to pay their fair friends an illimitable visit.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c46.s2">The rain, which has been endurable enough for the walk or ride one way, is sure to become so heavy, and at the same time so certain to clear up by and by, that nothing but an open quarrel can abbreviate the visit; latent detestation will not do at all.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c46.s3">And if people happen to be lovers, what can be so delightful, in England, as a rainy morning?</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c46.s4">English sunshine is dubious; bonnets are never quite secure; and if you sit down on the grass, it may lead to catarrhs.</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c46.s5">But the rain is to be depended on.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c46.s6">You gallop through it in a mackintosh, and presently find yourself in the seat you like best,--a little above or a little below the one on which your goddess sits (it is the same thing to the metaphysical mind, and that is the reason why women are at once worshipped and looked down upon), with a satisfactory confidence that there will be no lady-callers.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c46.p2" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="mill.c46.s7"><qs/>"Stephen will come earlier this morning, I know,"<qe/><sss/> said Lucy; <sse/><qs/>"he always does when it's rainy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c46.p3"><s sid="8" id="mill.c46.s8">Maggie made no answer.</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c46.s9">She was angry with Stephen; she began to think she should dislike him; and if it had not been for the rain, she would have gone to her aunt Glegg's this morning, and so have avoided him altogether.</s> <s sid="10" id="mill.c46.s10">As it was, she must find some reason for remaining out of the room with her mother.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c46.p4"><s sid="11" id="mill.c46.s11">But Stephen did not come earlier, and there was another visitor--a nearer neighbor--who preceded him.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c46.s12">When Philip entered the room, he was going merely to bow to Maggie, feeling that their acquaintance was a secret which he was bound not to betray; but when she advanced toward him and put out her hand, he guessed at once that Lucy had been taken into her confidence.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c46.s13">It was a moment of some agitation to both, though Philip had spent many hours in preparing for it; but like all persons who have passed through life with little expectation of sympathy, he seldom lost his self-control, and shrank with the most sensitive pride from any noticeable betrayal of emotion.</s> <s sid="14" id="mill.c46.s14">A little extra paleness, a little tension of the nostril when he spoke, and the voice pitched in rather a higher key, that to strangers would seem expressive of cold indifference, were all the signs Philip usually gave of an inward drama that was not without its fierceness.</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c46.s15">But Maggie, who had little more power of concealing the impressions made upon her than if she had been constructed of musical strings, felt her eyes getting larger with tears as they took each other's hands in silence.</s> <s sid="16" id="mill.c46.s16">They were not painful tears; they had rather something of the same origin as the tears women and children shed when they have found some protection to cling to and look back on the threatened danger.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c46.s17">For Philip, who a little while ago was associated continually in Maggie's mind with the sense that Tom might reproach her with some justice, had now, in this short space, become a sort of outward conscience to her, that she might fly to for rescue and strength.</s> <s sid="18" id="mill.c46.s18">Her tranquil, tender affection for Philip, with its root deep down in her childhood, and its memories of long quiet talk confirming by distinct successive impressions the first instinctive bias,--the fact that in him the appeal was more strongly to her pity and womanly devotedness than to her vanity or other egoistic excitability of her nature,--seemed now to make a sort of sacred place, a sanctuary where she could find refuge from an alluring influence which the best part of herself must resist; which must bring horrible tumult within, wretchedness without.</s> <s sid="19" id="mill.c46.s19">This new sense of her relation to Philip nullified the anxious scruples she would otherwise have felt, lest she should overstep the limit of intercourse with him that Tom would sanction; and she put out her hand to him, and felt the tears in her eyes without any consciousness of an inward check.</s> <s sid="20" id="mill.c46.s20">The scene was just what Lucy expected, and her kind heart delighted in bringing Philip and Maggie together again; though, even with all _her_ regard for Philip, she could not resist the impression that her cousin Tom had some excuse for feeling shocked at the physical incongruity between the two,--a prosaic person like cousin Tom, who didn't like poetry and fairy tales.</s> <s sid="21" id="mill.c46.s21">But she began to speak as soon as possible, to set them at ease.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c46.p5" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="mill.c46.s22"><qs/>"This was very good and virtuous of you,"<qe/><sls/> she said, in her pretty treble, like the low conversational notes of little birds, <sle/><qs/>"to come so soon after your arrival.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c46.s23">And as it is, I think I will pardon you for running away in an inopportune manner, and giving your friends no notice.</s> <s sid="24" id="mill.c46.s24">Come and sit down here,"<qe/><sls/> she went on, placing the chair that would suit him best, <sle/><qs/>"and you shall find yourself treated mercifully."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mill.c46.p6" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="mill.c46.s25"><qs/>"You will never govern well, Miss Deane,"<qe/><sls/> said Philip, as he seated himself, <sle/><qs/>"because no one will ever believe in your severity.</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c46.s26">People will always encourage themselves in misdemeanors by the certainty that you will be indulgent."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c46.p7"><s sid="27" id="mill.c46.s27">Lucy gave some playful contradiction, but Philip did not hear what it was, for he had naturally turned toward Maggie, and she was looking at him with that open, affectionate scrutiny which we give to a friend from whom we have been long separated.</s> <s sid="28" id="mill.c46.s28">What a moment their parting had been!</s> <s sid="29" id="mill.c46.s29">And Philip felt as if he were only in the morrow of it.</s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c46.s30">He felt this so keenly,--with such intense, detailed remembrance, with such passionate revival of all that had been said and looked in their last conversation,--that with that jealousy and distrust which in diffident natures is almost inevitably linked with a strong feeling, he thought he read in Maggie's glance and manner the evidence of a change.</s> <s sid="31" id="mill.c46.s31">The very fact that he feared and half expected it would be sure to make this thought rush in, in the absence of positive proof to the contrary.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mill.c46.p8" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="mill.c46.s32"><qs/>"I am having a great holiday, am I not?"<qe/> said Maggie.</s> <s sid="33" id="mill.c46.s33"><qs/>"Lucy is like a fairy godmother; she has turned me from a drudge into a princess in no time.</s> <s sid="34" id="mill.c46.s34">I do nothing but indulge myself all day long, and she always finds out what I want before I know it myself."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c46.p9" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="mill.c46.s35"><qs/>"I am sure she is the happier for having you, then,"<qe/> said Philip.</s> <s sid="36" id="mill.c46.s36"><qs/>"You must be better than a whole menagerie of pets to her.</s> <s sid="37" id="mill.c46.s37">And you look well.</s> <s sid="38" id="mill.c46.s38">You are benefiting by the change."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c46.p10"><s sid="39" id="mill.c46.s39">Artificial conversation of this sort went on a little while, till Lucy, determined to put an end to it, exclaimed, with a good imitation of annoyance, that she had forgotten something, and was quickly out of the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mill.c46.p11"><s sid="40" id="mill.c46.s40">In a moment Maggie and Philip leaned forward, and the hands were clasped again, with a look of sad contentment, like that of friends who meet in the memory of recent sorrow.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mill.c46.p12" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="mill.c46.s41"><qs/>"I told my brother I wished to see you, Philip; I asked him to release me from my promise, and he consented."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mill.c46.p13"><s sid="42" id="mill.c46.s42">Maggie, in her impulsiveness, wanted Philip to know at once the position they must hold toward each other; but she checked herself.</s> <s sid="43" id="mill.c46.s43">The things that had happened since he had spoken of his love for her were so painful that she shrank from being the first to alude to them.</s> <s sid="44" id="mill.c46.s44">It seemed almost like an injury toward Philip even to mention her brother,--her brother, who had insulted him.</s> <s sid="45" id="mill.c46.s45">But he was thinking too entirely of her to be sensitive on any other point at that moment.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mill.c46.p14" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="mill.c46.s46"><qs/>"Then we can at least be friends, Maggie?</s> <s sid="47" id="mill.c46.s47">There is nothing to hinder that now?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mill.c46.p15" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="mill.c46.s48"><qs/>"Will not your father object?"<qe/> said Maggie, withdrawing her hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mill.c46.p16" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="mill.c46.s49"><qs/>"I should not give you up on any ground but your own wish, Maggie,"<qe/> said Philip, coloring.</s> <s sid="50" id="mill.c46.s50"><qs/>"There are points on which I should always resist my father, as I used to tell you.</s> <s sid="51" id="mill.c46.s51">_That_ is one."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mill.c46.p17" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="mill.c46.s52"><qs/>"Then there is nothing to hinder our being friends, Philip,--seeing each other and talking to each other while I am here; I shall soon go away again.</s> <s sid="53" id="mill.c46.s53">I mean to go very soon, to a new situation."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mill.c46.p18" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="mill.c46.s54"><qs/>"Is that inevitable, Maggie?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mill.c46.p19" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="mill.c46.s55"><qs/>"Yes; I must not stay here long.</s> <s sid="56" id="mill.c46.s56">It would unfit me for the life I must begin again at last.</s> <s sid="57" id="mill.c46.s57">I can't live in dependence,--I can't live with my brother, though he is very good to me.</s> <s sid="58" id="mill.c46.s58">He would like to provide for me; but that would be intolerable to me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mill.c46.p20"><s sid="59" id="mill.c46.s59">Philip was silent a few moments, and then said, in that high, feeble voice which with him indicated the resolute suppression of emotion,--</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mill.c46.p21" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="mill.c46.s60"><qs/>"Is there no other alternative, Maggie?</s> <s sid="61" id="mill.c46.s61">Is that life, away from those who love you, the only one you will allow yourself to look forward to?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mill.c46.p22" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="mill.c46.s62"><qs/>"Yes, Philip,"<qe/> she said, looking at him pleadingly, as if she entreated him to believe that she was compelled to this course.</s> <s sid="63" id="mill.c46.s63"><qs/>"At least, as things are; I don't know what may be in years to come.</s> <s sid="64" id="mill.c46.s64">But I begin to think there can never come much happiness to me from loving; I have always had so much pain mingled with it.</s> <s sid="65" id="mill.c46.s65">I wish I could make myself a world outside it, as men do."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mill.c46.p23" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="mill.c46.s66"><qs/>"Now you are returning to your old thought in a new form, Maggie,--the thought I used to combat,"<qe/> said Philip, with a slight tinge of bitterness.</s> <s sid="67" id="mill.c46.s67"><qs/>"You want to find out a mode of renunciation that will be an escape from pain.</s> <s sid="68" id="mill.c46.s68">I tell you again, there is no such escape possible except by perverting or mutilating one's nature.</s> <s sid="69" id="mill.c46.s69">What would become of me, if I tried to escape from pain?</s> <s sid="70" id="mill.c46.s70">Scorn and cynicism would be my only opium; unless I could fall into some kind of conceited madness, and fancy myself a favorite of Heaven because I am not a favorite with men."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mill.c46.p24"><s sid="71" id="mill.c46.s71">The bitterness had taken on some impetuosity as Philip went on speaking; the words were evidently an outlet for some immediate feeling of his own, as well as an answer to Maggie.</s> <s sid="72" id="mill.c46.s72">There was a pain pressing on him at that moment.</s> <s sid="73" id="mill.c46.s73">He shrank with proud delicacy from the faintest allusion to the words of love, of plighted love that had passed between them.</s> <s sid="74" id="mill.c46.s74">It would have seemed to him like reminding Maggie of a promise; it would have had for him something of the baseness of compulsion.</s> <s sid="75" id="mill.c46.s75">He could not dwell on the fact that he himself had not changed; for that too would have had the air of an appeal.</s> <s sid="76" id="mill.c46.s76">His love for Maggie was stamped, even more than the rest of his experience, with the exaggerated sense that he was an exception,--that she, that every one, saw him in the light of an exception.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="mill.c46.p25"><s sid="77" id="mill.c46.s77">But Maggie was conscience-stricken.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="mill.c46.p26" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="mill.c46.s78"><qs/>"Yes, Philip,"<qe/><sls/> she said, with her childish contrition when he used to chide her, <sle/><qs/>"you are right, I know.</s> <s sid="79" id="mill.c46.s79">I do always think too much of my own feelings, and not enough of others',--not enough of yours.</s> <s sid="80" id="mill.c46.s80">I had need have you always to find fault with me and teach me; so many things have come true that you used to tell me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="mill.c46.p27"><s sid="81" id="mill.c46.s81">Maggie was resting her elbow on the table, leaning her head on her hand and looking at Philip with half-penitent dependent affection, as she said this; while he was returning her gaze with an expression that, to her consciousness, gradually became less vague,--became charged with a specific recollection.</s> <s sid="82" id="mill.c46.s82">Had his mind flown back to something that _she_ now remembered,--something about a lover of Lucy's?</s> <s sid="83" id="mill.c46.s83">It was a thought that made her shudder; it gave new definiteness to her present position, and to the tendency of what had happened the evening before.</s> <s sid="84" id="mill.c46.s84">She moved her arm from the table, urged to change her position by that positive physical oppression at the heart that sometimes accompanies a sudden mental pang.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="mill.c46.p28" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="mill.c46.s85"><qs/>"What is the matter, Maggie?</s> <s sid="86" id="mill.c46.s86">Has something happened?"<qe/></s> <s sid="87" id="mill.c46.s87">Philip said, in inexpressible anxiety, his imagination being only too ready to weave everything that was fatal to them both.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="mill.c46.p29" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="mill.c46.s88"><qs/>"No, nothing,"<qe/> said Maggie, rousing her latent will.</s> <s sid="89" id="mill.c46.s89">Philip must not have that odious thought in his mind; she would banish it from her own.</s> <s sid="90" id="mill.c46.s90"><qs/>"Nothing,"<qe/><sss/> she repeated, <sse/><qs/>"except in my own mind.</s> <s sid="91" id="mill.c46.s91">You used to say I should feel the effect of my starved life, as you called it; and I do.</s> <s sid="92" id="mill.c46.s92">I am too eager in my enjoyment of music and all luxuries, now they are come to me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="mill.c46.p30"><s sid="93" id="mill.c46.s93">She took up her work and occupied herself resolutely, while Philip watched her, really in doubt whether she had anything more than this general allusion in her mind.</s> <s sid="94" id="mill.c46.s94">It was quite in Maggie's character to be agitated by vague self-reproach.</s> <s sid="95" id="mill.c46.s95">But soon there came a violent well-known ring at the door-bell resounding through the house.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="mill.c46.p31" type="speech"><s sid="96" id="mill.c46.s96"><qs/>"Oh, what a startling announcement!"<qe/> said Maggie, quite mistress of herself, though not without some inward flutter.</s> <s sid="97" id="mill.c46.s97"><qs/>"I wonder where Lucy is."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="mill.c46.p32"><s sid="98" id="mill.c46.s98">Lucy had not been deaf to the signal, and after an interval long enough for a few solicitous but not hurried inquiries, she herself ushered Stephen in.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="mill.c46.p33" type="speech"><s sid="99" id="mill.c46.s99"><qs/>"Well, old fellow,"<qe/><sls/> he said, going straight up to Philip and shaking him heartily by the hand, bowing to Maggie in passing, <sle/><qs/>"it's glorious to have you back again; only I wish you'd conduct yourself a little less like a sparrow with a residence on the house-top, and not go in and out constantly without letting the servants know.</s> <s sid="100" id="mill.c46.s100">This is about the twentieth time I've had to scamper up those countless stairs to that painting-room of yours, all to no purpose, because your people thought you were at home.</s> <s sid="101" id="mill.c46.s101">Such incidents embitter friendship."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="mill.c46.p34" type="speech"><s sid="102" id="mill.c46.s102"><qs/>"I've so few visitors, it seems hardly worth while to leave notice of my exit and entrances,"<qe/> said Philip, feeling rather oppressed just then by Stephen's bright strong presence and strong voice.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="mill.c46.p35" type="speech"><s sid="103" id="mill.c46.s103"><qs/>"Are you quite well this morning, Miss Tulliver?"<qe/> said Stephen, turning to Maggie with stiff politeness, and putting out his hand with the air of fulfilling a social duty.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="mill.c46.p36" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="mill.c46.s104">Maggie gave the tips of her fingers, and said, <qs/>"Quite well, thank you,"<qe/> in a tone of proud indifference.</s> <s sid="105" id="mill.c46.s105">Philip's eyes were watching them keenly; but Lucy was used to seeing variations in their manner to each other, and only thought with regret that there was some natural antipathy which every now and then surmounted their mutual good-will.</s> <s sid="106" id="mill.c46.s106"><qs/>"Maggie is not the sort of woman Stephen admires, and she is irritated by something in him which she interprets as conceit,"<qe/> was the silent observation that accounted for everything to guileless Lucy.</s> <s sid="107" id="mill.c46.s107">Stephen and Maggie had no sooner completed this studied greeting than each felt hurt by the other's coldness.</s> <s sid="108" id="mill.c46.s108">And Stephen, while rattling on in questions to Philip about his recent sketching expedition, was thinking all the more about Maggie because he was not drawing her into the conversation as he had invariably done before.</s> <s sid="109" id="mill.c46.s109"><qs/>"Maggie and Philip are not looking happy,"<qe/><sss/> thought Lucy; <sse/><qs/>"this first interview has been saddening to them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="mill.c46.p37" type="speech"><s sid="110" id="mill.c46.s110"><qs/>"I think we people who have not been galloping,"<qe/><sss/> she said to Stephen, <sse/><qs/>"are all a little damped by the rain.</s> <s sid="111" id="mill.c46.s111">Let us have some music.</s> <s sid="112" id="mill.c46.s112">We ought to take advantage of having Philip and you together.</s> <s sid="113" id="mill.c46.s113">Give us the duet in 'Masaniello'; Maggie has not heard that, and I know it will suit her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="mill.c46.p38" type="speech"><s sid="114" id="mill.c46.s114"><qs/>"Come, then,"<qe/><sls/> said Stephen, going toward the piano, and giving a foretaste of the tune in his deep <sle/><qs/>"brum-brum,"<qe/> very pleasant to hear.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="mill.c46.p39" type="speech"><s sid="115" id="mill.c46.s115"><qs/>"You, please, Philip,--you play the accompaniment,"<qe/><sss/> said Lucy, <sse/><qs/>"and then I can go on with my work.</s> <s sid="116" id="mill.c46.s116">You _will_ like to play, sha'n't you?"<qe/> she added, with a pretty, inquiring look, anxious, as usual, lest she should have proposed what was not pleasant to another; but with yearnings toward her unfinished embroidery.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="mill.c46.p40"><s sid="117" id="mill.c46.s117">Philip had brightened at the proposition, for there is no feeling, perhaps, except the extremes of fear and grief, that does not find relief in music,--that does not make a man sing or play the better; and Philip had an abundance of pent-up feeling at this moment, as complex as any trio or quartet that was ever meant to express love and jealousy and resignation and fierce suspicion, all at the same time.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="mill.c46.p41" type="speech"><s sid="118" id="mill.c46.s118"><qs/>"Oh, yes,"<qe/><sls/> he said, seating himself at the piano, <sle/><qs/>"it is a way of eking out one's imperfect life and being three people at once,--to sing and make the piano sing, and hear them both all the while,--or else to sing and paint."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="mill.c46.p42" type="speech"><s sid="119" id="mill.c46.s119"><qs/>"Ah, there you are an enviable fellow.</s> <s sid="120" id="mill.c46.s120">I can do nothing with my hands,"<qe/> said Stephen.</s> <s sid="121" id="mill.c46.s121"><qs/>"That has generally been observed in men of great administrative capacity, I believe,--a tendency to predominance of the reflective powers in me!</s> <s sid="122" id="mill.c46.s122">Haven't you observed that, Miss Tulliver?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="mill.c46.p43"><s sid="123" id="mill.c46.s123">Stephen had fallen by mistake into his habit of playful appeal to Maggie, and she could not repress the answering flush and epigram.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="mill.c46.p44" type="speech"><s sid="124" id="mill.c46.s124"><qs/>"I _have_ observed a tendency to predominance,"<qe/> she said, smiling; and Philip at that moment devoutly hoped that she found the tendency disagreeable.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c48.p1"><s sid="1" id="mill.c48.s1">The culmination of Maggie's career as an admired member of society in St.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c48.s2">Ogg's was certainly the day of the bazaar, when her simple noble beauty, clad in a white muslin of some soft-floating kind, which I suspect must have come from the stores of aunt Pullet's wardrobe, appeared with marked distinction among the more adorned and conventional women around her.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c48.s3">We perhaps never detect how much of our social demeanor is made up of artificial airs until we see a person who is at once beautiful and simple; without the beauty, we are apt to call simplicity awkwardness.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c48.s4">The Miss Guests were much too well-bred to have any of the grimaces and affected tones that belong to pretentious vulgarity; but their stall being next to the one where Maggie sat, it seemed newly obvious to-day that Miss Guest held her chin too high, and that Miss Laura spoke and moved continually with a view to effect.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c48.p2"><s sid="5" id="mill.c48.s5">All well-dressed St.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c48.s6">Ogg's and its neighborhood were there; and it would have been worth while to come even from a distance, to see the fine old hall, with its open roof and carved oaken rafters, and great oaken folding-doors, and light shed down from a height on the many-colored show beneath; a very quaint place, with broad faded stripes painted on the walls, and here and there a show of heraldic animals of a bristly, long-snouted character, the cherished emblems of a noble family once the seigniors of this now civic hall.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c48.s7">A grand arch, cut in the upper wall at one end, surmounted an oaken orchestra, with an open room behind it, where hothouse plants and stalls for refreshments were disposed; an agreeable resort for gentlemen disposed to loiter, and yet to exchange the occasional crush down below for a more commodious point of view.</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c48.s8">In fact, the perfect fitness of this ancient building for an admirable modern purpose, that made charity truly elegant, and led through vanity up to the supply of a deficit, was so striking that hardly a person entered the room without exchanging the remark more than once.</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c48.s9">Near the great arch over the orchestra was the stone oriel with painted glass, which was one of the venerable inconsistencies of the old hall; and it was close by this that Lucy had her stall, for the convenience of certain large plain articles which she had taken charge of for Mrs. Kenn.</s> <s sid="10" id="mill.c48.s10">Maggie had begged to sit at the open end of the stall, and to have the sale of these articles rather than of bead-mats and other elaborate products of which she had but a dim understanding.</s> <s sid="11" id="mill.c48.s11">But it soon appeared that the gentlemen's dressing-gowns, which were among her commodities, were objects of such general attention and inquiry, and excited so troublesome a curiosity as to their lining and comparative merits, together with a determination to test them by trying on, as to make her post a very conspicuous one.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c48.s12">The ladies who had commodities of their own to sell, and did not want dressing-gowns, saw at once the frivolity and bad taste of this masculine preference for goods which any tailor could furnish; and it is possible that the emphatic notice of various kinds which was drawn toward Miss Tulliver on this public occasion, threw a very strong and unmistakable light on her subsequent conduct in many minds then present.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c48.s13">Not that anger, on account of spurned beauty can dwell in the celestial breasts of charitable ladies, but rather that the errors of persons who have once been much admired necessarily take a deeper tinge from the mere force of contrast; and also, that to-day Maggie's conspicuous position, for the first time, made evident certain characteristics which were subsequently felt to have an explanatory bearing.</s> <s sid="14" id="mill.c48.s14">There was something rather bold in Miss Tulliver's direct gaze, and something undefinably coarse in the style of her beauty, which placed her, in the opinion of all feminine judges, far below her cousin Miss Deane; for the ladies of St.</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c48.s15">Ogg's had now completely ceded to Lucy their hypothetic claims on the admiration of Mr. Stephen Guest.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c48.p3" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="mill.c48.s16">As for dear little Lucy herself, her late benevolent triumph about the Mill, and all the affectionate projects she was cherishing for Maggie and Philip, helped to give her the highest spirits to-day, and she felt nothing but pleasure in the evidence of Maggie's attractiveness.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c48.s17">It is true, she was looking very charming herself, and Stephen was paying her the utmost attention on this public occasion; jealously buying up the articles he had seen under her fingers in the process of making, and gayly helping her to cajole the male customers into the purchase of the most effeminate futilities.</s> <s sid="18" id="mill.c48.s18">He chose to lay aside his hat and wear a scarlet fez of her embroidering; but by superficial observers this was necessarily liable to be interpreted less as a compliment to Lucy than as a mark of coxcombry.</s> <s sid="19" id="mill.c48.s19"><qs/>"Guest is a great coxcomb,"<qe/><sss/> young Torry observed; <sse/><qs/>"but then he is a privileged person in St.</s> <s sid="20" id="mill.c48.s20">Ogg's--he carries all before him; if another fellow did such things, everybody would say he made a fool of himself."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c48.p4"><s sid="21" id="mill.c48.s21">And Stephen purchased absolutely nothing from Maggie, until Lucy said, in rather a vexed undertone,--</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c48.p5" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="mill.c48.s22"><qs/>"See, now; all the things of Maggie's knitting will be gone, and you will not have bought one.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c48.s23">There are those deliciously soft warm things for the wrists,--do buy them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mill.c48.p6" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="mill.c48.s24"><qs/>"Oh no,"<qe/><sss/> said Stephen, <sse/><qs/>"they must be intended for imaginative persons, who can chill themselves on this warm day by thinking of the frosty Caucasus.</s> <s sid="25" id="mill.c48.s25">Stern reason is my forte, you know.</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c48.s26">You must get Philip to buy those.</s> <s sid="27" id="mill.c48.s27">By the way, why doesn't he come?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c48.p7" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="mill.c48.s28"><qs/>"He never likes going where there are many people, though I enjoined him to come.</s> <s sid="29" id="mill.c48.s29">He said he would buy up any of my goods that the rest of the world rejected.</s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c48.s30">But now, do go and buy something of Maggie."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mill.c48.p8" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="mill.c48.s31"><qs/>"No, no; see, she has got a customer; there is old Wakem himself just coming up."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c48.p9"><s sid="32" id="mill.c48.s32">Lucy's eyes turned with anxious interest toward Maggie to see how she went through this first interview, since a sadly memorable time, with a man toward whom she must have so strange a mixture of feelings; but she was pleased to notice that Wakem had tact enough to enter at once into talk about the bazaar wares, and appear interested in purchasing, smiling now and then kindly at Maggie, and not calling on her to speak much, as if he observed that she was rather pale and tremulous.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c48.p10" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="mill.c48.s33"><qs/>"Why, Wakem is making himself particularly amiable to your cousin,"<qe/><sls/> said Stephen, in an undertone to Lucy; <sle/><qs/>"is it pure magnanimity?</s> <s sid="34" id="mill.c48.s34">You talked of a family quarrel."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mill.c48.p11" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="mill.c48.s35"><qs/>"Oh, that will soon be quite healed, I hope,"<qe/> said Lucy, becoming a little indiscreet in her satisfaction, and speaking with an air of significance.</s> <s sid="36" id="mill.c48.s36">But Stephen did not appear to notice this, and as some lady-purchasers came up, he lounged on toward Maggie's end, handling trifles and standing aloof until Wakem, who had taken out his purse, had finished his t transactions.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mill.c48.p12" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="mill.c48.s37"><qs/>"My son came with me,"<qe/><sss/> he overheard Wakem saying, <sse/><qs/>"but he has vanished into some other part of the building, and has left all these charitable gallantries to me.</s> <s sid="38" id="mill.c48.s38">I hope you'll reproach him for his shabby conduct."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mill.c48.p13"><s sid="39" id="mill.c48.s39">She returned his smile and bow without speaking, and he turned away, only then observing Stephen and nodding to him.</s> <s sid="40" id="mill.c48.s40">Maggie, conscious that Stephen was still there, busied herself with counting money, and avoided looking up.</s> <s sid="41" id="mill.c48.s41">She had been well pleased that he had devoted himself to Lucy to-day, and had not come near her.</s> <s sid="42" id="mill.c48.s42">They had begun the morning with an indifferent salutation, and both had rejoiced in being aloof from each other, like a patient who has actually done without his opium, in spite of former failures in resolution.</s> <s sid="43" id="mill.c48.s43">And during the last few days they had even been making up their minds to failures, looking to the outward events that must soon come to separate them, as a reason for dispensing with self-conquest in detail.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mill.c48.p14" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="mill.c48.s44">Stephen moved step by step as if he were being unwillingly dragged, until he had got round the open end of the stall, and was half hidden by a screen of draperies.</s> <s sid="45" id="mill.c48.s45">Maggie went on counting her money till she suddenly heard a deep gentle voice saying, <qs/>"Aren't you very tried?</s> <s sid="46" id="mill.c48.s46">Do let me bring you something,--some fruit or jelly, mayn't I?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mill.c48.p15"><s sid="47" id="mill.c48.s47">The unexpected tones shook her like a sudden accidental vibration of a harp close by her.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mill.c48.p16" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="mill.c48.s48"><qs/>"Oh no, thank you,"<qe/> she said faintly, and only half looking up for an instant.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mill.c48.p17" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="mill.c48.s49"><qs/>"You look so pale,"<qe/> Stephen insisted, in a more entreating tone.</s> <s sid="50" id="mill.c48.s50"><qs/>"I'm sure you're exhausted.</s> <s sid="51" id="mill.c48.s51">I must disobey you, and bring something."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mill.c48.p18" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="mill.c48.s52"><qs/>"No, indeed, I couldn't take it."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mill.c48.p19" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="mill.c48.s53"><qs/>"Are you angry with me?</s> <s sid="54" id="mill.c48.s54">What have I done?</s> <s sid="55" id="mill.c48.s55">_Do_ look at me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mill.c48.p20" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="mill.c48.s56"><qs/>"Pray, go away,"<qe/> said Maggie, looking at him helplessly, her eyes glancing immediately from him to the opposite corner of the orchestra, which was half hidden by the folds of the old faded green curtain.</s> <s sid="57" id="mill.c48.s57">Maggie had no sooner uttered this entreaty than she was wretched at the admission it implied; but Stephen turned away at once, and following her upward glance, he saw Philip Wakem sealed in the half-hidden corner, so that he could command little more than that angle of the hall in which Maggie sat.</s> <s sid="58" id="mill.c48.s58">An entirely new though occurred to Stephen, and linking itself with what he had observed of Wakem's manner, and with Lucy's reply to his observation, it convinced him that there had been some former relation between Philip and Maggie beyond that childish one of which he had heard.</s> <s sid="59" id="mill.c48.s59">More than one impulse made him immediately leave the hall and go upstairs to the refreshment-room, where, walking up to Philip, he sat down behind him, and put his hand on his shoulder.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mill.c48.p21" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="mill.c48.s60"><qs/>"Are you studying for a portrait, Phil,"<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>"or for a sketch of that oriel window?</s> <s sid="61" id="mill.c48.s61">By George, it makes a capital bit from this dark corner, with the curtain just marking it off."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mill.c48.p22" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="mill.c48.s62"><qs/>"I have been studying expression,"<qe/> said Philip, curtly.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mill.c48.p23" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="mill.c48.s63"><qs/>"What!</s> <s sid="64" id="mill.c48.s64">Miss Tulliver's?</s> <s sid="65" id="mill.c48.s65">It's rather of the savage-moody order to-day, I think,--something of the fallen princess serving behind a counter.</s> <s sid="66" id="mill.c48.s66">Her cousin sent me to her with a civil offer to get her some refreshment, but I have been snubbed, as usual.</s> <s sid="67" id="mill.c48.s67">There's natural antipathy between us, I suppose; I have seldom the honor to please her."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mill.c48.p24" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="mill.c48.s68"><qs/>"What a hypocrite you are!"<qe/> said Philip, flushing angrily.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="mill.c48.p25" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="mill.c48.s69"><qs/>"What! because experience must have told me that I'm universally pleasing?</s> <s sid="70" id="mill.c48.s70">I admit the law, but there's some disturbing force here."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="mill.c48.p26" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="mill.c48.s71"><qs/>"I am going,"<qe/> said Philip, rising abruptly.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="mill.c48.p27" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="mill.c48.s72"><qs/>"So am I--to get a breath of fresh air; this place gets oppressive.</s> <s sid="73" id="mill.c48.s73">I think I have done suit and service long enough."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="mill.c48.p28" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="mill.c48.s74">The two friends walked downstairs together without speaking.</s> <s sid="75" id="mill.c48.s75">Philip turned through the outer door into the court-yard; but Stephen, saying, <qs/>"Oh, by the by, I must call in here,"<qe/> went on along the passage to one of the rooms at the other end of the building, which were appropriated to the town library.</s> <s sid="76" id="mill.c48.s76">He had the room all to himself, and a man requires nothing less than this when he wants to dash his cap on the table, throw himself astride a chair, and stare at a high brick wall with a frown which would not have been beneath the occasion if he had been slaying <qs/>"the giant Python."<qe/></s> <s sid="77" id="mill.c48.s77">The conduct that issues from a moral conflict has often so close a resemblance to vice that the distinction escapes all outward judgments founded on a mere comparison of actions.</s> <s sid="78" id="mill.c48.s78">It is clear to you, I hope, that Stephen was not a hypocrite,--capable of deliberate doubleness for a selfish end; and yet his fluctuations between the indulgence of a feeling and the systematic concealment of it might have made a good case in support of Philip's accusation.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="mill.c48.p29"><s sid="79" id="mill.c48.s79">Meanwhile, Maggie sat at her stall cold and trembling, with that painful sensation in the eyes which comes from resolutely repressed tears.</s> <s sid="80" id="mill.c48.s80">Was her life to be always like this,--always bringing some new source of inward strife?</s> <s sid="81" id="mill.c48.s81">She heard confusedly the busy, indifferent voices around her, and wished her mind could flow into that easy babbling current.</s> <s sid="82" id="mill.c48.s82">It was at this moment that Dr. Kenn, who had quite lately come into the hall, and was now walking down the middle with his hands behind him, taking a general view, fixed his eyes on Maggie for the first time, and was struck with the expression of pain on her beautiful face.</s> <s sid="83" id="mill.c48.s83">She was sitting quite still, for the stream of customers had lessened at this late hour in the afternoon; the gentlemen had chiefly chosen the middle of the day, and Maggie's stall was looking rather bare.</s> <s sid="84" id="mill.c48.s84">This, with her absent, pained expression, finished the contrast between her and her companions, who were all bright, eager, and busy.</s> <s sid="85" id="mill.c48.s85">He was strongly arrested.</s> <s sid="86" id="mill.c48.s86">Her face had naturally drawn his attention as a new and striking one at church, and he had been introduced to her during a short call on business at Mr. Deane's, but he had never spoken more than three words to her.</s> <s sid="87" id="mill.c48.s87">He walked toward her now, and Maggie, perceiving some one approaching, roused herself to look up and be prepared to speak.</s> <s sid="88" id="mill.c48.s88">She felt a childlike, instinctive relief from the sense of uneasiness in this exertion, when she saw it was Dr. Kenn's face that was looking at her; that plain, middle-aged face, with a grave, penetrating kindness in it, seeming to tell of a human being who had reached a firm, safe strand, but was looking with helpful pity toward the strugglers still tossed by the waves, had an effect on Maggie at this moment which was afterward remembered by her as if it had been a promise.</s> <s sid="89" id="mill.c48.s89">The middle-aged, who have lived through their strongest emotions, but are yet in the time when memory is still half passionate and not merely contemplative, should surely be a sort of natural priesthood, whom life has disciplined and consecrated to be the refuge and rescue of early stumblers and victims of self-despair.</s> <s sid="90" id="mill.c48.s90">Most of us, at some moment in our young lives, would have welcomed a priest of that natural order in any sort of canonicals or uncanonicals, but had to scramble upward into all the difficulties of nineteen entirely without such aid, as Maggie did.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="mill.c48.p30" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="mill.c48.s91"><qs/>"You find your office rather a fatiguing one, I fear, Miss Tulliver,"<qe/> said Dr. Kenn.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="mill.c48.p31" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="mill.c48.s92"><qs/>"It is, rather,"<qe/> said Maggie, simply, not being accustomed to simpler amiable denials of obvious facts.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="mill.c48.p32" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="mill.c48.s93"><qs/>"But I can tell Mrs. Kenn that you have disposed of her goods very quickly,"<qe/><sss/> he added; <sse/><qs/>"she will be very much obliged to you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="mill.c48.p33" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="mill.c48.s94"><qs/>"Oh, I have done nothing; the gentlemen came very fast to buy the dressing-gowns and embroidered waistcoats, but I think any of the other ladies would have sold more; I didn't know what to say about them."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="mill.c48.p34" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="mill.c48.s95">Dr. Kenn smiled.</s> <s sid="96" id="mill.c48.s96"><qs/>"I hope I'm going to have you as a permanent parishioner now, Miss Tulliver; am I?</s> <s sid="97" id="mill.c48.s97">You have been at a distance from us hitherto."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="mill.c48.p35" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="mill.c48.s98"><qs/>"I have been a teacher in a school, and I'm going into another situation of the same kind very soon."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="mill.c48.p37" type="speech"><s sid="101" id="mill.c48.s101"><qs/>"Oh, _I must go_,"<qe/> said Maggie, earnestly, looking at Dr. Kenn with an expression of reliance, as if she had told him her history in those three words.</s> <s sid="102" id="mill.c48.s102">It was one of those moments of implicit revelation which will sometimes happen even between people who meet quite transiently,--on a mile's journey, perhaps, or when resting by the wayside.</s> <s sid="103" id="mill.c48.s103">There is always this possibility of a word or look from a stranger to keep alive the sense of human brotherhood.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="mill.c48.p38"><s sid="104" id="mill.c48.s104">Dr. Kenn's ear and eye took in all the signs that this brief confidence of Maggie's was charged with meaning.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="mill.c48.p40"><s sid="107" id="mill.c48.s107">He put out his hand and pressed hers kindly before he turned away.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="mill.c48.p41" type="speech"><s sid="108" id="mill.c48.s108"><qs/>"She has some trouble or other at heart,"<qe/> he thought.</s> <s sid="109" id="mill.c48.s109">"Poor child! she looks as if she might turn out to be one of</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="mill.c48.p44"><s sid="112" id="mill.c48.s112">It may be surprising that Maggie, among whose many imperfections an excessive delight in admiration and acknowledged supremacy were not absent now, any more than when she was instructing the gypsies with a view toward achieving a royal position among them, was not more elated on a day when she had had the tribute of so many looks and smiles, together with that satisfactory consciousness which had necessarily come from being taken before Lucy's chevalglass, and made to look at the full length of her tall beauty, crowned by the night of her massy hair.</s> <s sid="113" id="mill.c48.s113">Maggie had smiled at herself then, and for the moment had forgotten everything in the sense of her own beauty.</s> <s sid="114" id="mill.c48.s114">If that state of mind could have lasted, her choice would have been to have Stephen Guest at her feet, offering her a life filled with all luxuries, with daily incense of adoration near and distant, and with all possibilities of culture at her command.</s> <s sid="115" id="mill.c48.s115">But there were things in her stronger than vanity,--passion and affection, and long, deep memories of early discipline and effort, of early claims on her love and pity; and the stream of vanity was soon swept along and mingled imperceptibly with that wider current which was at its highest force today, under the double urgency of the events and inward impulses brought by the last week.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="mill.c48.p45"><s sid="116" id="mill.c48.s116">Philip had not spoken to her himself about the removal of obstacles between them on his father's side,--he shrank from that; but he had told everything to Lucy, with the hope that Maggie, being informed through her, might give him some encouraging sign that their being brought thus much nearer to each other was a happiness to her.</s> <s sid="117" id="mill.c48.s117">The rush of conflicting feelings was too great for Maggie to say much when Lucy, with a face breathing playful joy, like one of Correggio's cherubs, poured forth her triumphant revelation; and Lucy could hardly be surprised that she could do little more than cry with gladness at the thought of her father's wish being fulfilled, and of Tom's getting the Mill again in reward for all his hard striving.</s> <s sid="118" id="mill.c48.s118">The details of preparation for the bazaar had then come to usurp Lucy's attention for the next few days, and nothing had been said by the cousins on subjects that were likely to rouse deeper feelings.</s> <s sid="119" id="mill.c48.s119">Philip had been to the house more than once, but Maggie had had no private conversation with him, and thus she had been left to fight her inward battle without interference.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="mill.c48.p46"><s sid="120" id="mill.c48.s120">But when the bazaar was fairly ended, and the cousins were alone again, resting together at home, Lucy said,--</s> </p>

<title>Chapter X The Spell Seems Broken</title>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c49.p1"><s sid="1" id="mill.c49.s1">The suite of rooms opening into each other at Park House looked duly brilliant with lights and flowers and the personal splendors of sixteen couples, with attendant parents and guardians.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c49.s2">The focus of brilliancy was the long drawing-room, where the dancing went forward, under the inspiration of the grand piano; the library, into which it opened at one end, had the more sober illumination of maturity, with caps and cards; and at the other end the pretty sitting-room, with a conservatory attached, was left as an occasional cool retreat.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c49.s3">Lucy, who had laid aside her black for the first time, and had her pretty slimness set off by an abundant dress of white crape, was the acknowledged queen of the occasion; for this was one of the Miss Guests' thoroughly condescending parties, including no member of any aristocracy higher than that of St.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c49.s4">Ogg's, and stretching to the extreme limits of commercial and professional gentility.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c49.p2"><s sid="5" id="mill.c49.s5">Maggie at first refused to dance, saying that she had forgotten all the figures--it was so many years since she had danced at school; and she was glad to have that excuse, for it is ill dancing with a heavy heart.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c49.s6">But at length the music wrought in her young limbs, and the longing came; even though it was the horrible young Torry, who walked up a second time to try and persuade her.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c49.s7">She warned him that she could not dance anything but a country-dance; but he, of course, was willing to wait for that high felicity, meaning only to be complimentary when he assured her at several intervals that it was a "great bore" that she couldn't waltz, he would have liked so much to waltz with her.</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c49.s8">But at last it was the turn of the good old-fashioned dance which has the least of vanity and the most of merriment in it, and Maggie quite forgot her troublous life in a childlike enjoyment of that half-rustic rhythm which seems to banish pretentious etiquette.</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c49.s9">She felt quite charitably toward young Torry, as his hand bore her along and held her up in the dance; her eyes and cheeks had that fire of young joy in them which will flame out if it can find the least breath to fan it; and her simple black dress, with its bit of black lace, seemed like the dim setting of a jewel.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c49.p3"><s sid="10" id="mill.c49.s10">Stephen had not yet asked her to dance; had not yet paid her more than a passing civility.</s> <s sid="11" id="mill.c49.s11">Since yesterday, that inward vision of her which perpetually made part of his consciousness, had been half screened by the image of Philip Wakem, which came across it like a blot; there was some attachment between her and Philip; at least there was an attachment on his side, which made her feel in some bondage.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c49.s12">Here, then, Stephen told himself, was another claim of honor which called on him to resist the attraction that was continually threatening to overpower him.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c49.s13">He told himself so; and yet he had once or twice felt a certain savage resistance, and at another moment a shuddering repugnance, to this intrusion of Philip's image, which almost made it a new incitement to rush toward Maggie and claim her for himself.</s> <s sid="14" id="mill.c49.s14">Nevertheless, he had done what he meant to do this evening,--he had kept aloof from her; he had hardly looked at her; and he had been gayly assiduous to Lucy.</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c49.s15">But now his eyes were devouring Maggie; he felt inclined to kick young Torry out of the dance, and take his place.</s> <s sid="16" id="mill.c49.s16">Then he wanted the dance to end that he might get rid of his partner.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c49.s17">The possibility that he too should dance with Maggie, and have her hand in his so long, was beginning to possess him like a thirst.</s> <s sid="18" id="mill.c49.s18">But even now their hands were meeting in the dance,--were meeting still to the very end of it, though they were far off each other.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c49.p4"><s sid="19" id="mill.c49.s19">Stephen hardly knew what happened, or in what automatic way he got through the duties of politeness in the interval, until he was free and saw Maggie seated alone again, at the farther end of the room.</s> <s sid="20" id="mill.c49.s20">He made his way toward her round the couples that were forming for the waltz; and when Maggie became conscious that she was the person he sought, she felt, in spite of all the thoughts that had gone before, a glowing gladness at heart.</s> <s sid="21" id="mill.c49.s21">Her eyes and cheeks were still brightened with her childlike enthusiasm in the dance; her whole frame was set to joy and tenderness; even the coming pain could not seem bitter,--she was ready to welcome it as a part of life, for life at this moment seemed a keen, vibrating consciousness poised above pleasure or pain.</s> <s sid="22" id="mill.c49.s22">This one, this last night, she might expand unrestrainedly in the warmth of the present, without those chill, eating thoughts of the past and the future.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c49.p5" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="mill.c49.s23"><qs/>"They're going to waltz again,"<qe/> said Stephen, bending to speak to her, with that glance and tone of subdued tenderness which young dreams create to themselves in the summer woods when low, cooing voices fill the air.</s> <s sid="24" id="mill.c49.s24">Such glances and tones bring the breath of poetry with them into a room that is half stifling with glaring gas and hard flirtation.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mill.c49.p6" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="mill.c49.s25"><qs/>"They are going to waltz again.</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c49.s26">It is rather dizzy work to look on, and the room is very warm; shall we walk about a little?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c49.p7"><s sid="27" id="mill.c49.s27">He took her hand and placed it within his arm, and they walked on into the sitting-room, where the tables were strewn with engravings for the accommodation of visitors who would not want to look at them.</s> <s sid="28" id="mill.c49.s28">But no visitors were here at this moment.</s> <s sid="29" id="mill.c49.s29">They passed on into the conservatory.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mill.c49.p8" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="mill.c49.s30"><qs/>"How strange and unreal the trees and flowers look with the lights among them!"<qe/> said Maggie, in a low voice.</s> <s sid="31" id="mill.c49.s31"><qs/>"They look as if they belonged to an enchanted land, and would never fade away; I could fancy they were all made of jewels."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c49.p9"><s sid="32" id="mill.c49.s32">She was looking at the tier of geraniums as she spoke, and Stephen made no answer; but he was looking at her; and does not a supreme poet blend light and sound into one, calling darkness mute, and light eloquent?</s> <s sid="33" id="mill.c49.s33">Something strangely powerful there was in the light of Stephen's long gaze, for it made Maggie's face turn toward it and look upward at it, slowly, like a flower at the ascending brightness.</s> <s sid="34" id="mill.c49.s34">And they walked unsteadily on, without feeling that they were walking; without feeling anything but that long, grave, mutual gaze which has the solemnity belonging to all deep human passion.</s> <s sid="35" id="mill.c49.s35">The hovering thought that they must and would renounce each other made this moment of mute confession more intense in its rapture.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c49.p10"><s sid="36" id="mill.c49.s36">But they had reached the end of the conservatory, and were obliged to pause and turn.</s> <s sid="37" id="mill.c49.s37">The change of movement brought a new consciousness to Maggie; she blushed deeply, turned away her head, and drew her arm from Stephen's, going up to some flowers to smell them.</s> <s sid="38" id="mill.c49.s38">Stephen stood motionless, and still pale.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mill.c49.p11" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="mill.c49.s39"><qs/>"Oh, may I get this rose?"<qe/> said Maggie, making a great effort to say something, and dissipate the burning sense of irretrievable confession.</s> <s sid="40" id="mill.c49.s40"><qs/>"I think I am quite wicked with roses; I like to gather them and smell them till they have no scent left."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mill.c49.p12"><s sid="41" id="mill.c49.s41">Stephen was mute; he was incapable of putting a sentence together, and Maggie bent her arm a little upward toward the large half-opened rose that had attracted her.</s> <s sid="42" id="mill.c49.s42">Who has not felt the beauty of a woman's arm?</s> <s sid="43" id="mill.c49.s43">The unspeakable suggestions of tenderness that lie in the dimpled elbow, and all the varied gently lessening curves, down to the delicate wrist, with its tiniest, almost imperceptible nicks in the firm softness.</s> <s sid="44" id="mill.c49.s44">A woman's arm touched the soul of a great sculptor two thousand years ago, so that he wrought an image of it for the Parthenon which moves us still as it clasps lovingly the timeworn marble of a headless trunk.</s> <s sid="45" id="mill.c49.s45">Maggie's was such an arm as that, and it had the warm tints of life.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mill.c49.p13"><s sid="46" id="mill.c49.s46">A mad impulse seized on Stephen; he darted toward the arm, and showered kisses on it, clasping the wrist.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mill.c49.p14"><s sid="47" id="mill.c49.s47">But the next moment Maggie snatched it from him, and glared at him like a wounded war-goddess, quivering with rage and humiliation.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mill.c49.p15" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="mill.c49.s48"><qs/>"How dare you?"<qe/></s> <s sid="49" id="mill.c49.s49">She spoke in a deeply shaken, half-smothered voice.</s> <s sid="50" id="mill.c49.s50"><qs/>"What right have I given you to insult me?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mill.c49.p16"><s sid="51" id="mill.c49.s51">She darted from him into the adjoining room, and threw herself on the sofa, panting and trembling.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mill.c49.p17"><s sid="52" id="mill.c49.s52">A horrible punishment was come upon her for the sin of allowing a moment's happiness that was treachery to Lucy, to Philip, to her own better soul.</s> <s sid="53" id="mill.c49.s53">That momentary happiness had been smitten with a blight, a leprosy; Stephen thought more lightly of _her_ than he did of Lucy.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mill.c49.p18"><s sid="54" id="mill.c49.s54">As for Stephen, he leaned back against the framework of the conservatory, dizzy with the conflict of passions,--love, rage, and confused despair; despair at his want of self-mastery, and despair that he had offended Maggie.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mill.c49.p19"><s sid="55" id="mill.c49.s55">The last feeling surmounted every other; to be by her side again and entreat forgiveness was the only thing that had the force of a motive for him, and she had not been seated more than a few minutes when he came and stood humbly before her.</s> <s sid="56" id="mill.c49.s56">But Maggie's bitter rage was unspent.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mill.c49.p20" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="mill.c49.s57"><qs/>"Leave me to myself, if you please,"<qe/><sls/> she said, with impetuous haughtiness, <sle/><qs/>"and for the future avoid me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mill.c49.p21"><s sid="58" id="mill.c49.s58">Stephen turned away, and walked backward and forward at the other end of the room.</s> <s sid="59" id="mill.c49.s59">There was the dire necessity of going back into the dancing-room again, and he was beginning to be conscious of that.</s> <s sid="60" id="mill.c49.s60">They had been absent so short a time, that when he went in again the waltz was not ended.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mill.c49.p22"><s sid="61" id="mill.c49.s61">Maggie, too, was not long before she re-entered.</s> <s sid="62" id="mill.c49.s62">All the pride of her nature was stung into activity; the hateful weakness which had dragged her within reach of this wound to her self-respect had at least wrought its own cure.</s> <s sid="63" id="mill.c49.s63">The thoughts and temptations of the last month should all be flung away into an unvisited chamber of memory.</s> <s sid="64" id="mill.c49.s64">There was nothing to allure her now; duty would be easy, and all the old calm purposes would reign peacefully once more.</s> <s sid="65" id="mill.c49.s65">She re-entered the drawing-room still with some excited brightness in her face, but with a sense of proud self-command that defied anything to agitate her.</s> <s sid="66" id="mill.c49.s66">She refused to dance again, but she talked quite readily and calmly with every one who addressed her.</s> <s sid="67" id="mill.c49.s67">And when they got home that night, she kissed Lucy with a free heart, almost exulting in this scorching moment, which had delivered her from the possibility of another word or look that would have the stamp of treachery toward that gentle, unsuspicious sister.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mill.c49.p23"><s sid="68" id="mill.c49.s68">The next morning Maggie did not set off to Basset quite so soon as she had expected.</s> <s sid="69" id="mill.c49.s69">Her mother was to accompany her in the carriage, and household business could not be dispatched hastily by Mrs. Tulliver.</s> <s sid="70" id="mill.c49.s70">So Maggie, who had been in a hurry to prepare herself, had to sit waiting, equipped for the drive, in the garden.</s> <s sid="71" id="mill.c49.s71">Lucy was busy in the house wrapping up some bazaar presents for the younger ones at Basset, and when there was a loud ring at the door-bell, Maggie felt some alarm lest Lucy should bring out Stephen to her; it was sure to be Stephen.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mill.c49.p24"><s sid="72" id="mill.c49.s72">But presently the visitor came out into the garden alone, and seated himself by her on the garden-chair.</s> <s sid="73" id="mill.c49.s73">It was not Stephen.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c50.p5" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="mill.c50.s8"><qs/>"Who is it, my dear?"<qe/> said Mrs. Moss, seeing in Maggie's face the evidence that she knew.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c51.p2"><s sid="4" id="mill.c51.s4">Lucy came so early as to have the start even of aunt Glegg; for she longed to have some undisturbed talk with Maggie about the wonderful news.</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c51.s5">It seemed, did it not? said Lucy, with her prettiest air of wisdom, as if everything, even other people's misfortunes (poor creatures!) were conspiring now to make poor dear aunt Tulliver, and cousin Tom, and naughty Maggie too, if she were not obstinately bent on the contrary, as happy as they deserved to be after all their troubles.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c51.s6">To think that the very day--the _very day_--after Tom had come back from Newcastle, that unfortunate young Jetsome, whom Mr. Wakem had placed at the Mill, had been pitched off his horse in a drunken fit, and was lying at St.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c51.s7">Ogg's in a dangerous state, so that Wakem had signified his wish that the new purchasers should enter on the premises at once!</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c51.p3"><s sid="8" id="mill.c51.s8">It was very dreadful for that unhappy young man, but it did seem as if the misfortune had happened then, rather than at any other time, in order that cousin Tom might all the sooner have the fit reward of his exemplary conduct,--papa thought so very highly of him.</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c51.s9">Aunt Tulliver must certainly go to the Mill now, and keep house for Tom; that was rather a loss to Lucy in the matter of household comfort; but then, to think of poor aunty being in her old place again, and gradually getting comforts about her there!</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c51.p4"><s sid="10" id="mill.c51.s10">On this last point Lucy had her cunning projects, and when she and Maggie had made their dangerous way down the bright stairs into the handsome parlor, where the very sunbeams seemed cleaner than elsewhere, she directed her manoeuvres, as any other great tactician would have done, against the weaker side of the enemy.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c51.p5" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="mill.c51.s11"><qs/>"Aunt Pullet,"<qe/><sls/> she said, seating herself on the sofa, and caressingly adjusting that lady's floating cap-string, <sle/><qs/>"I want you to make up your mind what linen and things you will give Tom toward housekeeping; because you are always so generous,--you give such nice things, you know; and if you set the example, aunt Glegg will follow."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mill.c51.p6" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="mill.c51.s12"><qs/>"That she never can, my dear,"<qe/><sls/> said Mrs. Pullet, with unusual vigor, <sle/><qs/>"for she hasn't got the linen to follow suit wi' mine, I can tell you.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c51.s13">She'd niver the taste, not if she'd spend the money.</s> <s sid="14" id="mill.c51.s14">Big checks and live things, like stags and foxes, all her table-linen is,--not a spot nor a diamond among 'em.</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c51.s15">But it's poor work dividing one's linen before one dies,--I niver thought to ha' done that, Bessy,"<qe/><sls/> Mrs. Pullet continued, shaking her head and looking at her sister Tulliver, <sle/><qs/>"when you and me chose the double diamont, the first flax iver we'd spun, and the Lord knows where yours is gone."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c51.p7" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="mill.c51.s16"><qs/>"I'd no choice, I'm sure, sister,"<qe/> said poor Mrs. Tulliver, accustomed to consider herself in the light of an accused person.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c51.s17"><qs/>"I'm sure it was no wish o' mine, iver, as I should lie awake o' nights thinking o' my best bleached linen all over the country."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mill.c51.p8" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="mill.c51.s18"><qs/>"Take a peppermint, Mrs. Tulliver,"<qe/> said uncle Pullet, feeling that he was offering a cheap and wholesome form of comfort, which he was recommending by example.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c51.p9" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="mill.c51.s19"><qs/>"Oh, but, aunt Pullet,"<qe/><sss/> said Lucy, <sse/><qs/>"you've so much beautiful linen.</s> <s sid="20" id="mill.c51.s20">And suppose you had had daughters!</s> <s sid="21" id="mill.c51.s21">Then you must have divided it when they were married."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c51.p10" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="mill.c51.s22"><qs/>"Well, I don't say as I won't do it,"<qe/><sss/> said Mrs. Pullet, <sse/><qs/>"for now Tom's so lucky, it's nothing but right his friends should look on him and help him.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c51.s23">There's the tablecloths I bought at your sale, Bessy; it was nothing but good natur' o' me to buy 'em, for they've been lying in the chest ever since.</s> <s sid="24" id="mill.c51.s24">But I'm not going to give Maggie any more o' my Indy muslin and things, if she's to go into service again, when she might stay and keep me company, and do my sewing for me, if she wasn't wanted at her brother's."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mill.c51.p11"><s sid="25" id="mill.c51.s25">"Going into service" was the expression by which the Dodson mind represented to itself the position of teacher or governess; and Maggie's return to that menial condition, now circumstances offered her more eligible prospects, was likely to be a sore point with all her relatives, besides Lucy.</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c51.s26">Maggie in her crude form, with her hair down her back, and altogether in a state of dubious promise, was a most undesirable niece; but now she was capable of being at once ornamental and useful.</s> <s sid="27" id="mill.c51.s27">The subject was revived in aunt and uncle Glegg's presence, over the tea and muffins.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mill.c51.p12" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="mill.c51.s28"><qs/>"Hegh, hegh!"<qe/><sls/> said Mr. Glegg, good-naturedly patting Maggie on the back, <sle/><qs/>"nonsense, nonsense!</s> <s sid="29" id="mill.c51.s29">Don't let us hear of you taking a place again, Maggie.</s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c51.s30">Why, you must ha' picked up half-a-dozen sweethearts at the bazaar; isn't there one of'em the right sort of article?</s> <s sid="31" id="mill.c51.s31">Come, now?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mill.c51.p13" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="mill.c51.s32"><qs/>"Mr. Glegg,"<qe/><sls/> said his wife, with that shade of increased politeness in her severity which she always put on with her crisper fronts, <sle/><qs/>"you'll excuse me, but you're far too light for a man of your years.</s> <s sid="33" id="mill.c51.s33">It's respect and duty to her aunts, and the rest of her kin as are so good to her, should have kept my niece from fixing about going away again without consulting us; not sweethearts, if I'm to use such a word, though it was never heared in _my_ family."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mill.c51.p14" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="mill.c51.s34"><qs/>"Why, what did they call us, when we went to see 'em, then, eh, neighbor Pullet?</s> <s sid="35" id="mill.c51.s35">They thought us sweet enough then,"<qe/> said Mr. Glegg, winking pleasantly; while Mr. Pullet, at the suggestion of sweetness, took a little more sugar.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mill.c51.p15" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="mill.c51.s36"><qs/>"Mr. Glegg,"<qe/><sss/> said Mrs. G., <sse/><qs/>"if you're going to be undelicate, let me know."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mill.c51.p16" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="mill.c51.s37"><qs/>"La, Jane, your husband's only joking,"<qe/><sss/> said Mrs. Pullet; <sse/><qs/>"let him joke while he's got health and strength.</s> <s sid="38" id="mill.c51.s38">There's poor Mr. Tilt got his mouth drawn all o' one side, and couldn't laugh if he was to try."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mill.c51.p17" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="mill.c51.s39"><qs/>"I'll trouble you for the muffineer, then, Mr. Glegg,"<qe/><sss/> said Mrs. G., <sse/><qs/>"if I may be so bold to interrupt your joking.</s> <s sid="40" id="mill.c51.s40">Though it's other people must see the joke in a niece's putting a slight on her mother's eldest sister, as is the head o' the family; and only coming in and out on short visits, all the time she's been in the town, and then settling to go away without my knowledge,--as I'd laid caps out on purpose for her to make 'em up for me,--and me as have divided my money so equal----"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mill.c51.p18" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="mill.c51.s41"><qs/>"Sister,"<qe/><sls/> Mrs. Tulliver broke in anxiously, <sle/><qs/>"I'm sure Maggie never thought o' going away without staying at your house as well as the others.</s> <s sid="42" id="mill.c51.s42">Not as it's my wish she should go away at all, but quite contrairy.</s> <s sid="43" id="mill.c51.s43">I'm sure I'm innocent.</s> <s sid="44" id="mill.c51.s44">I've said over and over again, <alt-qs/>'My dear, you've no call to go away.'<alt-qe/></s> <s sid="45" id="mill.c51.s45">But there's ten days or a fortnight Maggie'll have before she's fixed to go; she can stay at your house just as well, and I'll step in when I can, and so will Lucy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mill.c51.p19" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="mill.c51.s46"><qs/>"Bessy,"<qe/><sss/> said Mrs. Glegg, <sse/><qs/>"if you'd exercise a little more thought, you might know I should hardly think it was worth while to unpin a bed, and go to all that trouble now, just at the end o' the time, when our house isn't above a quarter of an hour's walk from Mr. Deane's.</s> <s sid="47" id="mill.c51.s47">She can come the first thing in the morning, and go back the last at night, and be thankful she's got a good aunt so close to her to come and sit with.</s> <s sid="48" id="mill.c51.s48">I know _I_ should, when I was her age."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mill.c51.p20" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="mill.c51.s49"><qs/>"La, Jane,"<qe/><sss/> said Mrs. Pullet, <sse/><qs/>"it 'ud do your beds good to have somebody to sleep in 'em.</s> <s sid="50" id="mill.c51.s50">There's that striped room smells dreadful mouldy, and the glass mildewed like anything.</s> <s sid="51" id="mill.c51.s51">I'm sure I thought I should be struck with death when you took me in."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mill.c51.p21" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="mill.c51.s52"><qs/>"Oh, there is Tom!"<qe/> exclaimed Lucy, clapping her hands.</s> <s sid="53" id="mill.c51.s53"><qs/>"He's come on Sindbad, as I told him.</s> <s sid="54" id="mill.c51.s54">I was afraid he was not going to keep his promise."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mill.c51.p22" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="mill.c51.s55">Maggie jumped up to kiss Tom as he entered, with strong feeling, at this first meeting since the prospect of returning to the Mill had been opened to him; and she kept his hand, leading him to the chair by her side.</s> <s sid="56" id="mill.c51.s56">To have no cloud between herself and Tom was still a perpetual yearning in her, that had its root deeper than all change.</s> <s sid="57" id="mill.c51.s57">He smiled at her very kindly this evening, and said, <qs/>"Well, Magsie, how's aunt Moss?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mill.c51.p23" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="mill.c51.s58"><qs/>"Come, come, sir,"<qe/> said Mr. Glegg putting out his hand.</s> <s sid="59" id="mill.c51.s59"><qs/>"Why, you're such a big man, you carry all before you, it, seems.</s> <s sid="60" id="mill.c51.s60">You're come into your luck a good deal earlier than us old folks did; but I wish you joy, I wish you joy.</s> <s sid="61" id="mill.c51.s61">You'll get the Mill all for your own again some day, I'll be bound.</s> <s sid="62" id="mill.c51.s62">You won't stop half-way up the hill."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="mill.c51.p24" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="mill.c51.s63"><qs/>"But I hope he'll bear in mind as it's his mother's family as he owes it to,"<qe/> said Mrs. Glegg.</s> <s sid="64" id="mill.c51.s64"><qs/>"If he hadn't had them to take after, he'd ha' been poorly off.</s> <s sid="65" id="mill.c51.s65">There was never any failures, nor lawing, nor wastefulness in our family, nor dying without wills----"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="mill.c51.p25" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="mill.c51.s66"><qs/>"No, nor sudden deaths,"<qe/><sss/> said aunt Pullet; <sse/><qs/>"allays the doctor called in.</s> <s sid="67" id="mill.c51.s67">But Tom had the Dodson skin; I said that from the first.</s> <s sid="68" id="mill.c51.s68">And I don't know what _you_ mean to do, sister Glegg, but I mean to give him a tablecloth of all my three biggest sizes but one, besides sheets.</s> <s sid="69" id="mill.c51.s69">I don't say what more I shall do; but _that_ I shall do, and if I should die to-morrow, Mr. Pullet, you'll bear it in mind,--though you'll be blundering with the keys, and never remember as that on the third shelf o' the left-hand wardrobe, behind the night-caps with the broad ties,--not the narrow-frilled uns,--is the key of the drawer in the Blue Room, where the key o' the Blue Closet is.</s> <s sid="70" id="mill.c51.s70">You'll make a mistake, and I shall niver be worthy to know it.</s> <s sid="71" id="mill.c51.s71">You've a memory for my pills and draughts, wonderful,--I'll allays say that of you,--but you're lost among the keys."<qe/></s> <s sid="72" id="mill.c51.s72">This gloomy prospect of the confusion that would ensue on her decease was very affecting to Mrs. Pullet.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="mill.c51.p26" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="mill.c51.s73"><qs/>"You carry it too far, Sophy,--that locking in and out,"<qe/> said Mrs. Glegg, in a tone of some disgust at this folly.</s> <s sid="74" id="mill.c51.s74"><qs/>"You go beyond your own family.</s> <s sid="75" id="mill.c51.s75">There's nobody can say I don't lock up; but I do what's reasonable, and no more.</s> <s sid="76" id="mill.c51.s76">And as for the linen, I shall look out what's serviceable, to make a present of to my nephey; I've got cloth as has never been whitened, better worth having than other people's fine holland; and I hope he'll lie down in it and think of his aunt."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="mill.c51.p27"><s sid="77" id="mill.c51.s77">Tom thanked Mrs. Glegg, but evaded any promise to meditate nightly on her virtues; and Mrs. Glegg effected a diversion for him by asking about Mr. Deane's intentions concerning steam.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="mill.c51.p28" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="mill.c51.s78">Lucy had had her far-sighted views in begging Tom to come on Sindbad.</s> <s sid="79" id="mill.c51.s79">It appeared, when it was time to go home, that the man-servant was to ride the horse, and cousin Tom was to drive home his mother and Lucy.</s> <s sid="80" id="mill.c51.s80"><qs/>"You must sit by yourself, aunty,"<qe/><sls/> said that contriving young lady, <sle/><qs/>"because I must sit by Tom; I've a great deal to say to him."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="mill.c51.p29"><s sid="81" id="mill.c51.s81">In the eagerness of her affectionate anxiety for Maggie, Lucy could not persuade herself to defer a conversation about her with Tom, who, she thought, with such a cup of joy before him as this rapid fulfilment of his wish about the Mill, must become pliant and flexible.</s> <s sid="82" id="mill.c51.s82">Her nature supplied her with no key to Tom's; and she was puzzled as well as pained to notice the unpleasant change on his countenance when she gave him the history of the way in which Philip had used his influence with his father.</s> <s sid="83" id="mill.c51.s83">She had counted on this revelation as a great stroke of policy, which was to turn Tom's heart toward Philip at once, and, besides that, prove that the elder Wakem was ready to receive Maggie with all the honors of a daughter-in-law.</s> <s sid="84" id="mill.c51.s84">Nothing was wanted, then, but for dear Tom, who always had that pleasant smile when he looked at cousin Lucy, to turn completely round, say the opposite of what he had always said before, and declare that he, for his part, was delighted that all the old grievances should be healed, and that Maggie should have Philip with all suitable despatch; in cousin Lucy's opinion nothing could be easier.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="mill.c51.p30" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="mill.c51.s85">But to minds strongly marked by the positive and negative qualities that create severity,--strength of will, conscious rectitude of purpose, narrowness of imagination and intellect, great power of self-control, and a disposition to exert control over others,--prejudices come as the natural food of tendencies which can get no sustenance out of that complex, fragmentary, doubt-provoking knowledge which we call truth.</s> <s sid="86" id="mill.c51.s86">Let a prejudice be bequeathed, carried in the air, adopted by hearsay, caught in through the eye,--however it may come, these minds will give it a habitation; it is something to assert strongly and bravely, something to fill up the void of spontaneous ideas, something to impose on others with the authority of conscious right; it is at once a staff and a baton.</s> <s sid="87" id="mill.c51.s87">Every prejudice that will answer these purposes is self-evident.</s> <s sid="88" id="mill.c51.s88">Our good, upright Tom Tulliver's mind was of this class; his inward criticism of his father's faults did not prevent him from adopting his father's prejudice; it was a prejudice against a man of lax principle and lax life, and it was a meeting-point for all the disappointed feelings of family and personal pride.</s> <s sid="89" id="mill.c51.s89">Other feelings added their force to produce Tom's bitter repugnance to Philip, and to Maggie's union with him; and notwithstanding Lucy's power over her strong-willed cousin, she got nothing but a cold refusal ever to sanction such a marriage; <qs/>"but of course Maggie could do as she liked,--she had declared her determination to be independent.</s> <s sid="90" id="mill.c51.s90">For Tom's part, he held himself bound by his duty to his father's memory, and by every manly feeling, never to consent to any relation with the Wakems."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="mill.c51.p31"><s sid="91" id="mill.c51.s91">Thus, all that Lucy had effected by her zealous mediation was to fill Tom's mind with the expectation that Maggie's perverse resolve to go into a situation again would presently metamorphose itself, as her resolves were apt to do, into something equally perverse, but entirely different,--a marriage with Philip Wakem.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c54.p2"><s sid="4" id="mill.c54.s4">But Tom's face, as he stood in the hot, still sunshine of that summer afternoon, had no gladness, no triumph in it.</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c54.s5">His mouth wore its bitterest expression, his severe brow its hardest and deepest fold, as he drew down his hat farther over his eyes to shelter them from the sun, and thrusting his hands deep into his pockets, began to walk up and down the gravel.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c54.s6">No news of his sister had been heard since Bob Jakin had come back in the steamer from Mudport, and put an end to all improbable suppositions of an accident on the water by stating that he had seen her land from a vessel with Mr. Stephen Guest.</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c54.s7">Would the next news be that she was married,--or what?</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c54.s8">Probably that she was not married; Tom's mind was set to the expectation of the worst that could happen,--not death, but disgrace.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c54.p3"><s sid="9" id="mill.c54.s9">As he was walking with his back toward the entrance gate, and his face toward the rushing mill-stream, a tall, dark-eyed figure, that we know well, approached the gate, and paused to look at him with a fast-beating heart.</s> <s sid="10" id="mill.c54.s10">Her brother was the human being of whom she had been most afraid from her childhood upward; afraid with that fear which springs in us when we love one who is inexorable, unbending, unmodifiable, with a mind that we can never mould ourselves upon, and yet that we cannot endure to alienate from us.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c54.p4"><s sid="11" id="mill.c54.s11">That deep-rooted fear was shaking Maggie now; but her mind was unswervingly bent on returning to her brother, as the natural refuge that had been given her.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c54.s12">In her deep humiliation under the retrospect of her own weakness,--in her anguish at the injury she had inflicted,--she almost desired to endure the severity of Tom's reproof, to submit in patient silence to that harsh, disapproving judgment against which she had so often rebelled; it seemed no more than just to her now,--who was weaker than she was?</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c54.s13">She craved that outward help to her better purpose which would come from complete, submissive confession; from being in the presence of those whose looks and words would be a reflection of her own conscience.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mill.c54.p6"><s sid="19" id="mill.c54.s19">Maggie paused too, three yards before him.</s> <s sid="20" id="mill.c54.s20">She felt the hatred in his face, felt it rushing through her fibres; but she must speak.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c57.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="mill.c57.s1">By the end of the week Dr. Kenn had made up his mind that there was only one way in which he could secure to Maggie a suitable living at St.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c57.s2">Ogg's.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c57.s3">Even with his twenty years' experience as a parish priest, he was aghast at the obstinate continuance of imputations against her in the face of evidence.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c57.s4">Hitherto he had been rather more adored and appealed to than was quite agreeable to him; but now, in attempting to open the ears of women to reason, and their consciences to justice, on behalf of Maggie Tulliver, he suddenly found himself as powerless as he was aware he would have been if he had attempted to influence the shape of bonnets.</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c57.s5">Dr. Kenn could not be contradicted; he was listened to in silence; but when he left the room, a comparison of opinions among his hearers yielded much the same result as before.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c57.s6">Miss Tulliver had undeniably acted in a blamable manner, even Dr. Kenn did not deny that; how, then, could he think so lightly of her as to put that favorable interpretation on everything she had done?</s> <s sid="7" id="mill.c57.s7">Even on the supposition that required the utmost stretch of belief,--namely, that none of the things said about Miss Tulliver were true,--still, since they _had_ been said about her, they had cast an odor round her which must cause her to be shrunk from by every woman who had to take care of her own reputation--and of Society.</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c57.s8">To have taken Maggie by the hand and said, <qs/>"I will not believe unproved evil of you; my lips shall not utter it; my ears shall be closed against it; I, too, am an erring mortal, liable to stumble, apt to come short of my most earnest efforts; your lot has been harder than mine, your temptation greater; let us help each other to stand and walk without more falling,"<qe/>--to have done this would have demanded courage, deep pity, self-knowledge, generous trust; would have demanded a mind that tasted no piquancy in evil-speaking, that felt no self-exaltation in condemning, that cheated itself with no large words into the belief that life can have any moral end, any high religion, which excludes the striving after perfect truth, justice, and love toward the individual men and women who come across our own path.</s> <s sid="9" id="mill.c57.s9">The ladies of St.</s> <s sid="10" id="mill.c57.s10">Ogg's were not beguiled by any wide speculative conceptions; but they had their favorite abstraction, called Society, which served to make their consciences perfectly easy in doing what satisfied their own egoism,--thinking and speaking the worst of Maggie Tulliver, and turning their backs upon her.</s> <s sid="11" id="mill.c57.s11">It was naturally disappointing to Dr. Kenn, after two years of superfluous incense from his feminine parishioners, to find them suddenly maintaining their views in opposition to his; but then they maintained them in opposition to a higher Authority, which they had venerated longer.</s> <s sid="12" id="mill.c57.s12">That Authority had furnished a very explicit answer to persons who might inquire where their social duties began, and might be inclined to take wide views as to the starting-point.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c57.s13">The answer had not turned on the ultimate good of Society, but on "a certain man" who was found in trouble by the wayside.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c57.p2"><s sid="14" id="mill.c57.s14">Not that St.</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c57.s15">Ogg's was empty of women with some tenderness of heart and conscience; probably it had as fair a proportion of human goodness in it as any other small trading town of that day.</s> <s sid="16" id="mill.c57.s16">But until every good man is brave, we must expect to find many good women timid,--too timid even to believe in the correctness of their own best promptings, when these would place them in a minority.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c57.s17">And the men at St.</s> <s sid="18" id="mill.c57.s18">Ogg's were not all brave, by any means; some of them were even fond of scandal, and to an extent that might have given their conversation an effeminate character, if it had not been distinguished by masculine jokes, and by an occasional shrug of the shoulders at the mutual hatred of women.</s> <s sid="19" id="mill.c57.s19">It was the general feeling of the masculine mind at St.</s> <s sid="20" id="mill.c57.s20">Ogg's that women were not to be interfered with in their treatment of each other.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c57.p3" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="mill.c57.s21">And thus every direction in which Dr. Kenn had turned, in the hope of procuring some kind recognition and some employment for Maggie, proved a disappointment to him.</s> <s sid="22" id="mill.c57.s22">Mrs. James Torry could not think of taking Maggie as a nursery governess, even temporarily,--a young woman about whom <qs/>"such things had been said,"<qe/> and about whom "gentlemen joked"; and Miss Kirke, who had a spinal complaint, and wanted a reader and companion, felt quite sure that Maggie's mind must be of a quality with which she, for her part, could not risk _any_ contact.</s> <s sid="23" id="mill.c57.s23">Why did not Miss Tulliver accept the shelter offered her by her aunt Glegg?</s> <s sid="24" id="mill.c57.s24">It did not become a girl like her to refuse it.</s> <s sid="25" id="mill.c57.s25">Or else, why did she not go out of the neighborhood, and get a situation where she was not known?</s> <s sid="26" id="mill.c57.s26">(It was not, apparently, of so much importance that she should carry her dangerous tendencies into strange families unknown at St.</s> <s sid="27" id="mill.c57.s27">Ogg's.)</s> <s sid="28" id="mill.c57.s28">She must be very bold and hardened to wish to stay in a parish where she was so much stared at and whispered about.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c57.p4"><s sid="29" id="mill.c57.s29">Dr. Kenn, having great natural firmness, began, in the presence of this opposition, as every firm man would have done, to contract a certain strength of determination over and above what would have been called forth by the end in view.</s> <s sid="30" id="mill.c57.s30">He himself wanted a daily governess for his younger children; and though he had hesitated in the first instance to offer this position to Maggie, the resolution to protest with the utmost force of his personal and priestly character against her being crushed and driven away by slander, was now decisive.</s> <s sid="31" id="mill.c57.s31">Maggie gratefully accepted an employment that gave her duties as well as a support; her days would be filled now, and solitary evenings would be a welcome rest.</s> <s sid="32" id="mill.c57.s32">She no longer needed the sacrifice her mother made in staying with her, and Mrs. Tulliver was persuaded to go back to the Mill.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="mill.c57.p5"><s sid="33" id="mill.c57.s33">But now it began to be discovered that Dr. Kenn, exemplary as he had hitherto appeared, had his crotchets, possibly his weaknesses.</s> <s sid="34" id="mill.c57.s34">The masculine mind of St.</s> <s sid="35" id="mill.c57.s35">Ogg's smiled pleasantly, and did not wonder that Kenn liked to see a fine pair of eyes daily, or that he was inclined to take so lenient a view of the past; the feminine mind, regarded at that period as less powerful, took a more melancholy view of the case.</s> <s sid="36" id="mill.c57.s36">If Dr. Kenn should be beguiled into marrying that Miss Tulliver!</s> <s sid="37" id="mill.c57.s37">It was not safe to be too confident, even about the best of men; an apostle had fallen, and wept bitterly afterwards; and though Peter's denial was not a close precedent, his repentance was likely to be.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="mill.c57.p6"><s sid="38" id="mill.c57.s38">Maggie had not taken her daily walks to the Rectory for many weeks, before the dreadful possibility of her some time or other becoming the Rector's wife had been talked of so often in confidence, that ladies were beginning to discuss how they should behave to her in that position.</s> <s sid="39" id="mill.c57.s39">For Dr. Kenn, it had been understood, had sat in the schoolroom half an hour one morning, when Miss Tulliver was giving her lessons,--nay, he had sat there every morning; he had once walked home with her,--he almost _always_ walked home with her,--and if not, he went to see her in the evening.</s> <s sid="40" id="mill.c57.s40">What an artful creature she was!</s> <s sid="41" id="mill.c57.s41">What a _mother_ for those children!</s> <s sid="42" id="mill.c57.s42">It was enough to make poor Mrs. Kenn turn in her grave, that they should be put under the care of this girl only a few weeks after her death.</s> <s sid="43" id="mill.c57.s43">Would he be so lost to propriety as to marry her before the year was out?</s> <s sid="44" id="mill.c57.s44">The masculine mind was sarcastic, and thought _not_.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="mill.c57.p7"><s sid="45" id="mill.c57.s45">The Miss Guests saw an alleviation to the sorrow of witnessing a folly in their Rector; at least their brother would be safe; and their knowledge of Stephen's tenacity was a constant ground of alarm to them, lest he should come back and marry Maggie.</s> <s sid="46" id="mill.c57.s46">They were not among those who disbelieved their brother's letter; but they had no confidence in Maggie's adherence to her renunciation of him; they suspected that she had shrunk rather from the elopement than from the marriage, and that she lingered in St.</s> <s sid="47" id="mill.c57.s47">Ogg's, relying on his return to her.</s> <s sid="48" id="mill.c57.s48">They had always thought her disagreeable; they now thought her artful and proud; having quite as good grounds for that judgment as you and I probably have for many strong opinions of the same kind.</s> <s sid="49" id="mill.c57.s49">Formerly they had not altogether delighted in the contemplated match with Lucy, but now their dread of a marriage between Stephen and Maggie added its momentum to their genuine pity and indignation on behalf of the gentle forsaken girl, in making them desire that he should return to her.</s> <s sid="50" id="mill.c57.s50">As soon as Lucy was able to leave home, she was to seek relief from the oppressive heat of this August by going to the coast with the Miss Guests; and it was in their plans that Stephen should be induced to join them.</s> <s sid="51" id="mill.c57.s51">On the very first hint of gossip concerning Maggie and Dr. Kenn, the report was conveyed in Miss Guest's letter to her brother.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="mill.c57.p8"><s sid="52" id="mill.c57.s52">Maggie had frequent tidings through her mother, or aunt Glegg, or Dr. Kenn, of Lucy's gradual progress toward recovery, and her thoughts tended continually toward her uncle Deane's house; she hungered for an interview with Lucy, if it were only for five minutes, to utter a word of penitence, to be assured by Lucy's own eyes and lips that she did not believe in the willing treachery of those whom she had loved and trusted.</s> <s sid="53" id="mill.c57.s53">But she knew that even if her uncle's indignation had not closed his house against her, the agitation of such an interview would have been forbidden to Lucy.</s> <s sid="54" id="mill.c57.s54">Only to have seen her without speaking would have been some relief; for Maggie was haunted by a face cruel in its very gentleness; a face that had been turned on hers with glad, sweet looks of trust and love from the twilight time of memory; changed now to a sad and weary face by a first heart-stroke.</s> <s sid="55" id="mill.c57.s55">And as the days passed on, that pale image became more and more distinct; the picture grew and grew into more speaking definiteness under the avenging hand of remorse; the soft hazel eyes, in their look of pain, were bent forever on Maggie, and pierced her the more because she could see no anger in them.</s> <s sid="56" id="mill.c57.s56">But Lucy was not yet able to go to church, or any place where Maggie could see her; and even the hope of that departed, when the news was told her by aunt Glegg, that Lucy was really going away in a few days to Scarborough with the Miss Guests, who had been heard to say that they expected their brother to meet them there.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="mill.c57.p9"><s sid="57" id="mill.c57.s57">Only those who have known what hardest inward conflict is, can know what Maggie felt as she sat in her loneliness the evening after hearing that news from Mrs. Glegg,--only those who have known what it is to dread their own selfish desires as the watching mother would dread the sleeping-potion that was to still her own pain.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="mill.c57.p10" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="mill.c57.s58">She sat without candle in the twilight, with the window wide open toward the river; the sense of oppressive heat adding itself undistinguishably to the burthen of her lot.</s> <s sid="59" id="mill.c57.s59">Seated on a chair against the window, with her arm on the windowsill she was looking blankly at the flowing river, swift with the backward-rushing tide, struggling to see still the sweet face in its unreproaching sadness, that seemed now from moment to moment to sink away and be hidden behind a form that thrust itself between, and made darkness.</s> <s sid="60" id="mill.c57.s60">Hearing the door open, she thought Mrs. Jakin was coming in with her supper, as usual; and with that repugnance to trivial speech which comes with languor and wretchedness, she shrank from turning round and saying she wanted nothing; good little Mrs. Jakin would be sure to make some well-meant remarks.</s> <s sid="61" id="mill.c57.s61">But the next moment, without her having discerned the sound of a footstep, she felt a light hand on her shoulder, and heard a voice close to her saying, <qs/>"Maggie!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="mill.c57.p11"><s sid="62" id="mill.c57.s62">The face was there,--changed, but all the sweeter; the hazel eyes were there, with their heart-piercing tenderness.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="mill.c57.p12" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="mill.c57.s63"><qs/>"Maggie!"<qe/> the soft voice said.</s> <s sid="64" id="mill.c57.s64"><qs/>"Lucy!"<qe/> answered a voice with a sharp ring of anguish in it; and Lucy threw her arms round Maggie's neck, and leaned her pale cheek against the burning brow.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="mill.c57.p13" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="mill.c57.s65"><qs/>"I stole out,"<qe/><sls/> said Lucy, almost in a whisper, while she sat down close to Maggie and held her hand, <sle/><qs/>"when papa and the rest were away.</s> <s sid="66" id="mill.c57.s66">Alice is come with me.</s> <s sid="67" id="mill.c57.s67">I asked her to help me.</s> <s sid="68" id="mill.c57.s68">But I must only stay a little while, because it is so late."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="mill.c57.p14"><s sid="69" id="mill.c57.s69">It was easier to say that at first than to say anything else.</s> <s sid="70" id="mill.c57.s70">They sat looking at each other.</s> <s sid="71" id="mill.c57.s71">It seemed as if the interview must end without more speech, for speech was very difficult.</s> <s sid="72" id="mill.c57.s72">Each felt that there would be something scorching in the words that would recall the irretrievable wrong.</s> <s sid="73" id="mill.c57.s73">But soon, as Maggie looked, every distinct thought began to be overflowed by a wave of loving penitence, and words burst forth with a sob.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="mill.c57.p15" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="mill.c57.s74"><qs/>"God bless you for coming, Lucy."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="mill.c57.p16"><s sid="75" id="mill.c57.s75">The sobs came thick on each other after that.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="mill.c57.p17" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="mill.c57.s76"><qs/>"Maggie, dear, be comforted,"<qe/> said Lucy now, putting her cheek against Maggie's again.</s> <s sid="77" id="mill.c57.s77"><qs/>"Don't grieve."<qe/></s> <s sid="78" id="mill.c57.s78">And she sat still, hoping to soothe Maggie with that gentle caress.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="mill.c57.p18" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="mill.c57.s79"><qs/>"I didn't mean to deceive you, Lucy,"<qe/> said Maggie, as soon as she could speak.</s> <s sid="80" id="mill.c57.s80"><qs/>"It always made me wretched that I felt what I didn't like you to know.</s> <s sid="81" id="mill.c57.s81">It was because I thought it would all be conquered, and you might never see anything to wound you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="mill.c57.p19" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="mill.c57.s82"><qs/>"I know, dear,"<qe/> said Lucy.</s> <s sid="83" id="mill.c57.s83"><qs/>"I know you never meant to make me unhappy.</s> <s sid="84" id="mill.c57.s84">It is a trouble that has come on us all; you have more to bear than I have--and you gave him up, when--you did what it must have been very hard to do."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="mill.c57.p20"><s sid="85" id="mill.c57.s85">They were silent again a little while, sitting with clasped hands, and cheeks leaned together.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="mill.c57.p21" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="mill.c57.s86"><qs/>"Lucy,"<qe/><sss/> Maggie began again, <sse/><qs/>"_he_ struggled too.</s> <s sid="87" id="mill.c57.s87">He wanted to be true to you.</s> <s sid="88" id="mill.c57.s88">He will come back to you.</s> <s sid="89" id="mill.c57.s89">Forgive him--he will be happy then----"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="mill.c57.p22"><s sid="90" id="mill.c57.s90">These words were wrung forth from Maggie's deepest soul, with an effort like the convulsed clutch of a drowning man.</s> <s sid="91" id="mill.c57.s91">Lucy trembled and was silent.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="mill.c57.p23"><s sid="92" id="mill.c57.s92">A gentle knock came at the door.</s> <s sid="93" id="mill.c57.s93">It was Alice, the maid, who entered and said,--</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="mill.c57.p25" type="speech"><s sid="96" id="mill.c57.s96">Lucy rose and said, <qs/>"Very well, Alice,--in a minute."<qe/></s> </p>

<title>Chapter V The Last Conflict</title>

<p pid="1" id="mill.c58.p1"><s sid="1" id="mill.c58.s1">In the second week of September, Maggie was again sitting in her lonely room, battling with the old shadowy enemies that were forever slain and rising again.</s> <s sid="2" id="mill.c58.s2">It was past midnight, and the rain was beating heavily against the window, driven with fitful force by the rushing, loud-moaning wind.</s> <s sid="3" id="mill.c58.s3">For the day after Lucy's visit there had been a sudden change in the weather; the heat and drought had given way to cold variable winds, and heavy falls of rain at intervals; and she had been forbidden to risk the contemplated journey until the weather should become more settled.</s> <s sid="4" id="mill.c58.s4">In the counties higher up the Floss the rains had been continuous, and the completion of the harvest had been arrested.</s> <s sid="5" id="mill.c58.s5">And now, for the last two days, the rains on this lower course of the river had been incessant, so that the old men had shaken their heads and talked of sixty years ago, when the same sort of weather, happening about the equinox, brought on the great floods, which swept the bridge away, and reduced the town to great misery.</s> <s sid="6" id="mill.c58.s6">But the younger generation, who had seen several small floods, thought lightly of these sombre recollections and forebodings; and Bob Jakin, naturally prone to take a hopeful view of his own luck, laughed at his mother when she regretted their having taken a house by the riverside, observing that but for that they would have had no boats, which were the most lucky of possessions in case of a flood that obliged them to go to a distance for food.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="mill.c58.p2"><s sid="7" id="mill.c58.s7">But the careless and the fearful were alike sleeping in their beds now.</s> <s sid="8" id="mill.c58.s8">There was hope that the rain would abate by the morrow; threatenings of a worse kind, from sudden thaws after falls of snow, had often passed off, in the experience of the younger ones; and at the very worst, the banks would be sure to break lower down the river when the tide came in with violence, and so the waters would be carried off, without causing more than temporary inconvenience, and losses that would be felt only by the poorer sort, whom charity would relieve.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="mill.c58.p3"><s sid="9" id="mill.c58.s9">All were in their beds now, for it was past midnight; all except some solitary watchers such as Maggie.</s> <s sid="10" id="mill.c58.s10">She was seated in her little parlor toward the river, with one candle, that left everything dim in the room except a letter which lay before her on the table.</s> <s sid="11" id="mill.c58.s11">That letter, which had come to her to-day, was one of the causes that had kept her up far on into the night, unconscious how the hours were going, careless of seeking rest, with no image of rest coming across her mind, except of that far, far off rest from which there would be no more waking for her into this struggling earthly life.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="mill.c58.p4"><s sid="12" id="mill.c58.s12">Two days before Maggie received that letter, she had been to the Rectory for the last time.</s> <s sid="13" id="mill.c58.s13">The heavy rain would have prevented her from going since; but there was another reason.</s> <s sid="14" id="mill.c58.s14">Dr. Kenn, at first enlightened only by a few hints as to the new turn which gossip and slander had taken in relation to Maggie, had recently been made more fully aware of it by an earnest remonstrance from one of his male parishioners against the indiscretion of persisting in the attempt to overcome the prevalent feeling in the parish by a course of resistance.</s> <s sid="15" id="mill.c58.s15">Dr. Kenn, having a conscience void of offence in the matter, was still inclined to persevere,--was still averse to give way before a public sentiment that was odious and contemptible; but he was finally wrought upon by the consideration of the peculiar responsibility attached to his office, of avoiding the appearance of evil,--an "appearance" that is always dependent on the average quality of surrounding minds.</s> <s sid="16" id="mill.c58.s16">Where these minds are low and gross, the area of that "appearance" is proportionately widened.</s> <s sid="17" id="mill.c58.s17">Perhaps he was in danger of acting from obstinacy; perhaps it was his duty to succumb.</s> <s sid="18" id="mill.c58.s18">Conscientious people are apt to see their duty in that which is the most painful course; and to recede was always painful to Dr. Kenn.</s> <s sid="19" id="mill.c58.s19">He made up his mind that he must advise Maggie to go away from St.</s> <s sid="20" id="mill.c58.s20">Ogg's for a time; and he performed that difficult task with as much delicacy as he could, only stating in vague terms that he found his attempt to countenance her stay was a source of discord between himself and his parishioners, that was likely to obstruct his usefulness as a clergyman.</s> <s sid="21" id="mill.c58.s21">He begged her to allow him to write to a clerical friend of his, who might possibly take her into his own family as governess; and, if not, would probably know of some other available position for a young woman in whose welfare Dr. Kenn felt a strong interest.</s> </p>
