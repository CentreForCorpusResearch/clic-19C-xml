<title>Chapter 1</title>

<p pid="1" id="persuasion.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="persuasion.c1.s1">Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history with an interest which never failed.</s> <s sid="2" id="persuasion.c1.s2">This was the page at which the favourite volume always opened:</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="persuasion.c1.p2" type="speech" form="extended" position="beginning"><s sid="3" id="persuasion.c1.s3"><qs/>"ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.</s> </p><p pid="3" id="persuasion.c1.p3" type="speech" form="extended" position="end"><s sid="4" id="persuasion.c1.s4">"Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth, daughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of Gloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth, born June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son, November 5, 1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="4" id="persuasion.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="persuasion.c1.s5">Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's hands; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of himself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary's birth-- <qs/>"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove, Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,"<qe/> and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="persuasion.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="persuasion.c1.s6">Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family, in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire; how mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff, representing a borough in three successive parliaments, exertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year of Charles II, with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with the arms and motto:--<qs/>"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset,"<qe/> and Sir Walter's handwriting again in this finale:--</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="persuasion.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="persuasion.c1.s7"><qs/>"Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of the second Sir Walter."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="persuasion.c1.p7"><s sid="8" id="persuasion.c1.s8">Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character; vanity of person and of situation.</s> <s sid="9" id="persuasion.c1.s9">He had been remarkably handsome in his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.</s> <s sid="10" id="persuasion.c1.s10">Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did, nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society.</s> <s sid="11" id="persuasion.c1.s11">He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="persuasion.c1.p8"><s sid="12" id="persuasion.c1.s12">His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own.</s> <s sid="13" id="persuasion.c1.s13">Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman, sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured, or softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends, and her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them.</s> <s sid="14" id="persuasion.c1.s14">--Three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.</s> <s sid="15" id="persuasion.c1.s15">She had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="persuasion.c1.p9"><s sid="16" id="persuasion.c1.s16">This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance.</s> <s sid="17" id="persuasion.c1.s17">Thirteen years had passed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the other a widow.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="persuasion.c1.p10"><s sid="18" id="persuasion.c1.s18">That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not; but Sir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation.</s> <s sid="19" id="persuasion.c1.s19">Be it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications), prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sake.</s> <s sid="20" id="persuasion.c1.s20">For one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing, which he had not been very much tempted to do.</s> <s sid="21" id="persuasion.c1.s21">Elizabeth had succeeded, at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother's rights and consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself, her influence had always been great, and they had gone on together most happily.</s> <s sid="22" id="persuasion.c1.s22">His two other children were of very inferior value.</s> <s sid="23" id="persuasion.c1.s23">Mary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character, which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way-- she was only Anne.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="persuasion.c1.p11"><s sid="24" id="persuasion.c1.s24">To Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued god-daughter, favourite, and friend.</s> <s sid="25" id="persuasion.c1.s25">Lady Russell loved them all; but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="persuasion.c1.p12"><s sid="26" id="persuasion.c1.s26">A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem.</s> <s sid="27" id="persuasion.c1.s27">He had never indulged much hope, he had now none, of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work.</s> <s sid="28" id="persuasion.c1.s28">All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none:</s> <s sid="29" id="persuasion.c1.s29">Elizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="persuasion.c1.p13"><s sid="30" id="persuasion.c1.s30">It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost.</s> <s sid="31" id="persuasion.c1.s31">It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter might be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least, be deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing.</s> <s sid="32" id="persuasion.c1.s32">Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face in the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow's foot about Lady Russell's temples had long been a distress to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="persuasion.c1.p14"><s sid="33" id="persuasion.c1.s33">Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.</s> <s sid="34" id="persuasion.c1.s34">Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was.</s> <s sid="35" id="persuasion.c1.s35">For thirteen years had she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country.</s> <s sid="36" id="persuasion.c1.s36">Thirteen winters' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to London with her father, for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the great world.</s> <s sid="37" id="persuasion.c1.s37">She had the remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever, but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two.</s> <s sid="38" id="persuasion.c1.s38">Then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth, but now she liked it not.</s> <s sid="39" id="persuasion.c1.s39">Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister, made the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it open on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes, and pushed it away.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="persuasion.c1.p15"><s sid="40" id="persuasion.c1.s40">She had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book, and especially the history of her own family, must ever present the remembrance of.</s> <s sid="41" id="persuasion.c1.s41">The heir presumptive, the very William Walter Elliot, Esq., whose rights had been so generously supported by her father, had disappointed her.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="persuasion.c1.p16"><s sid="42" id="persuasion.c1.s42">She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be, in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet, meant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.</s> <s sid="43" id="persuasion.c1.s43">He had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death, Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it, making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="persuasion.c1.p17"><s sid="44" id="persuasion.c1.s44">He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour was confirmed.</s> <s sid="45" id="persuasion.c1.s45">He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.</s> <s sid="46" id="persuasion.c1.s46">The following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable, again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come; and the next tidings were that he was married.</s> <s sid="47" id="persuasion.c1.s47">Instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot, he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="persuasion.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="persuasion.c1.s48">Sir Walter has resented it.</s> <s sid="49" id="persuasion.c1.s49">As the head of the house, he felt that he ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand; <qs/>"For they must have been seen together,"<qe/><sss/> he observed, <sse/><qs/>"once at Tattersall's, and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons."<qe/></s> <s sid="50" id="persuasion.c1.s50">His disapprobation was expressed, but apparently very little regarded.</s> <s sid="51" id="persuasion.c1.s51">Mr Elliot had attempted no apology, and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between them had ceased.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="persuasion.c1.p19"><s sid="52" id="persuasion.c1.s52">This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval of several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man for himself, and still more for being her father's heir, and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot's eldest daughter.</s> <s sid="53" id="persuasion.c1.s53">There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.</s> <s sid="54" id="persuasion.c1.s54">Yet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was at this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons for his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.</s> <s sid="55" id="persuasion.c1.s55">The disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.</s> <s sid="56" id="persuasion.c1.s56">This could not be pardoned.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="persuasion.c1.p20"><s sid="57" id="persuasion.c1.s57">Such were Elizabeth Elliot's sentiments and sensations; such the cares to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life; such the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence in one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="persuasion.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="persuasion.c1.s58">But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these.</s> <s sid="59" id="persuasion.c1.s59">Her father was growing distressed for money.</s> <s sid="60" id="persuasion.c1.s60">She knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.</s> <s sid="61" id="persuasion.c1.s61">The Kellynch property was good, but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required in its possessor.</s> <s sid="62" id="persuasion.c1.s62">While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method, moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income; but with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it.</s> <s sid="63" id="persuasion.c1.s63">It had not been possible for him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his daughter.</s> <s sid="64" id="persuasion.c1.s64">He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town; he had gone so far even as to say, <qs/>"Can we retrench?</s> <s sid="65" id="persuasion.c1.s65">Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench?"<qe/> and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom.</s> <s sid="66" id="persuasion.c1.s66">But these measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards.</s> <s sid="67" id="persuasion.c1.s67">Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy.</s> <s sid="68" id="persuasion.c1.s68">She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="persuasion.c1.p22"><s sid="69" id="persuasion.c1.s69">There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of; but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.</s> <s sid="70" id="persuasion.c1.s70">He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power, but he would never condescend to sell.</s> <s sid="71" id="persuasion.c1.s71">No; he would never disgrace his name so far.</s> <s sid="72" id="persuasion.c1.s72">The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire, as he had received it.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="persuasion.c1.p23"><s sid="73" id="persuasion.c1.s73">Their two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in the neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="1" id="persuasion.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="persuasion.c2.s1">Mr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold or his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint, and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="persuasion.c2.p2"><s sid="2" id="persuasion.c2.s2">Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it much serious consideration.</s> <s sid="3" id="persuasion.c2.s3">She was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.</s> <s sid="4" id="persuasion.c2.s4">She was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour; but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter's feelings, as solicitous for the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.</s> <s sid="5" id="persuasion.c2.s5">She was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of strong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions of decorum, and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.</s> <s sid="6" id="persuasion.c2.s6">She had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry; she had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them.</s> <s sid="7" id="persuasion.c2.s7">Herself the widow of only a knight, she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due; and Sir Walter, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance, an attentive neighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her very dear friend, the father of Anne and her sisters, was, as being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="persuasion.c2.p3"><s sid="8" id="persuasion.c2.s8">They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.</s> <s sid="9" id="persuasion.c2.s9">But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth.</s> <s sid="10" id="persuasion.c2.s10">She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations, and she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted Anne, who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question.</s> <s sid="11" id="persuasion.c2.s11">She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to Sir Walter.</s> <s sid="12" id="persuasion.c2.s12">Every emendation of Anne's had been on the side of honesty against importance.</s> <s sid="13" id="persuasion.c2.s13">She wanted more vigorous measures, a more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt, a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="persuasion.c2.p5"><s sid="20" id="persuasion.c2.s20">This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding, his friends to be urging him.</s> <s sid="21" id="persuasion.c2.s21">She considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.</s> <s sid="22" id="persuasion.c2.s22">She wanted it to be prescribed, and felt as a duty.</s> <s sid="23" id="persuasion.c2.s23">She rated Lady Russell's influence highly; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete, than to half a reformation.</s> <s sid="24" id="persuasion.c2.s24">Her knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on, through the whole list of Lady Russell's too gentle reductions.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="persuasion.c2.p8"><s sid="36" id="persuasion.c2.s36">Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go was settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="persuasion.c2.p9"><s sid="37" id="persuasion.c2.s37">There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house in the country.</s> <s sid="38" id="persuasion.c2.s38">All Anne's wishes had been for the latter.</s> <s sid="39" id="persuasion.c2.s39">A small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have Lady Russell's society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object of her ambition.</s> <s sid="40" id="persuasion.c2.s40">But the usual fate of Anne attended her, in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on.</s> <s sid="41" id="persuasion.c2.s41">She disliked Bath, and did not think it agreed with her; and Bath was to be her home.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="persuasion.c2.p10"><s sid="42" id="persuasion.c2.s42">Sir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.</s> <s sid="43" id="persuasion.c2.s43">It was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important at comparatively little expense.</s> <s sid="44" id="persuasion.c2.s44">Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient distance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell's spending some part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction of Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="persuasion.c2.p11"><s sid="45" id="persuasion.c2.s45">Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne's known wishes.</s> <s sid="46" id="persuasion.c2.s46">It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood.</s> <s sid="47" id="persuasion.c2.s47">Anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter's feelings they must have been dreadful.</s> <s sid="48" id="persuasion.c2.s48">And with regard to Anne's dislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising, first, from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there, after her mother's death; and secondly, from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="persuasion.c2.p12"><s sid="49" id="persuasion.c2.s49">Lady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think it must suit them all; and as to her young friend's health, by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge, every danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must do both health and spirits good.</s> <s sid="50" id="persuasion.c2.s50">Anne had been too little from home, too little seen.</s> <s sid="51" id="persuasion.c2.s51">Her spirits were not high.</s> <s sid="52" id="persuasion.c2.s52">A larger society would improve them.</s> <s sid="53" id="persuasion.c2.s53">She wanted her to be more known.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="persuasion.c2.p15"><s sid="61" id="persuasion.c2.s61">How quick come the reasons for approving what we like!</s> <s sid="62" id="persuasion.c2.s62">Lady Russell had another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir Walter and his family were to remove from the country.</s> <s sid="63" id="persuasion.c2.s63">Elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.</s> <s sid="64" id="persuasion.c2.s64">It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned, after an unprosperous marriage, to her father's house, with the additional burden of two children.</s> <s sid="65" id="persuasion.c2.s65">She was a clever young woman, who understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least, at Kellynch Hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot, as to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all that Lady Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place, could hint of caution and reserve.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="persuasion.c2.p16"><s sid="66" id="persuasion.c2.s66">Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth, and seemed to love her, rather because she would love her, than because Elizabeth deserved it.</s> <s sid="67" id="persuasion.c2.s67">She had never received from her more than outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance; had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry, against previous inclination.</s> <s sid="68" id="persuasion.c2.s68">She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience; but always in vain:</s> <s sid="69" id="persuasion.c2.s69">Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay; turning from the society of so deserving a sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="persuasion.c2.p17"><s sid="70" id="persuasion.c2.s70">From situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell's estimate, a very unequal, and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion; and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot's reach, was therefore an object of first-rate importance.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="18" id="persuasion.c6.p18"><s sid="71" id="persuasion.c6.s71">Mrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness, uprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.</s> <s sid="72" id="persuasion.c6.s72">She had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face; though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.</s> <s sid="73" id="persuasion.c6.s73">Her manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had no distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any approach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.</s> <s sid="74" id="persuasion.c6.s74">Anne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration towards herself, in all that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her: especially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute, in the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft's side, to give a bias of any sort.</s> <s sid="75" id="persuasion.c6.s75">She was quite easy on that head, and consequently full of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft's suddenly saying,--</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="persuasion.c6.p23"><s sid="81" id="persuasion.c6.s81">The rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving, she heard the Admiral say to Mary--</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="persuasion.c6.p28"><s sid="94" id="persuasion.c6.s94">The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were, that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome, hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved; seldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="persuasion.c6.p31"><s sid="97" id="persuasion.c6.s97">In each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet, so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships, that it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove should have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="persuasion.c6.p32"><s sid="98" id="persuasion.c6.s98">She had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed; and the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, her poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten, had affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death.</s> <s sid="99" id="persuasion.c6.s99">Mr Musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="persuasion.c6.p33" type="speech"><s sid="100" id="persuasion.c6.s100">To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might, that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne's nerves.</s> <s sid="101" id="persuasion.c6.s101">She found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.</s> <s sid="102" id="persuasion.c6.s102">Since he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself to be insensible on such points.</s> <s sid="103" id="persuasion.c6.s103">And not only did it appear that he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick's having been six months under his care, and mentioning him in strong, though not perfectly well-spelt praise, as <qs/>"a fine dashing felow, only two perticular about the schoolmaster,"<qe/> were bent on introducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as they could hear of his arrival.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="persuasion.c7.p2"><s sid="4" id="persuasion.c7.s4">Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove's civility, and she was all but calling there in the same half hour.</s> <s sid="5" id="persuasion.c7.s5">She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House, where, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him, when they were stopped by the eldest boy's being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall.</s> <s sid="6" id="persuasion.c7.s6">The child's situation put the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="persuasion.c7.p3"><s sid="7" id="persuasion.c7.s7">His collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury received in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.</s> <s sid="8" id="persuasion.c7.s8">It was an afternoon of distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once; the apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed, the mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control, the youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it, proper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession rather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="persuasion.c7.p4"><s sid="9" id="persuasion.c7.s9">Her brother's return was the first comfort; he could take best care of his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.</s> <s sid="10" id="persuasion.c7.s10">Till he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were the worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where; but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson felt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best, and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind; and then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew's state, as to give the information of Captain Wentworth's visit; staying five minutes behind their father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance, who had been at all a favourite before.</s> <s sid="11" id="persuasion.c7.s11">How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma's farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrow; and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought.</s> <s sid="12" id="persuasion.c7.s12">And in short, he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him; and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="persuasion.c9.p2"><s sid="4" id="persuasion.c9.s4">It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.</s> <s sid="5" id="persuasion.c9.s5">The Musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly in the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves in their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig, lately added to their establishment.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="persuasion.c9.p3"><s sid="6" id="persuasion.c9.s6">Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the Musgroves and their dependencies.</s> <s sid="7" id="persuasion.c9.s7">It was unvarying, warm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more than established, when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them, to be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="persuasion.c9.p4"><s sid="8" id="persuasion.c9.s8">Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable, pleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth's introduction.</s> <s sid="9" id="persuasion.c9.s9">He was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood, where residence was not required, lived at his father's house, only two miles from Uppercross.</s> <s sid="10" id="persuasion.c9.s10">A short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period, and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners, and of seeing Captain Wentworth.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="persuasion.c9.p5"><s sid="11" id="persuasion.c9.s11">Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.</s> <s sid="12" id="persuasion.c9.s12">They had each had money, but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence.</s> <s sid="13" id="persuasion.c9.s13">Mr Hayter had some property of his own, but it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove's; and while the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country, the young Hayters would, from their parents' inferior, retired, and unpolished way of living, and their own defective education, have been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion with Uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="persuasion.c9.p6" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="persuasion.c9.s14">The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them pleased to improve their cousins.</s> <s sid="15" id="persuasion.c9.s15">Charles's attentions to Henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.</s> <s sid="16" id="persuasion.c9.s16"><qs/>"It would not be a great match for her; but if Henrietta liked him,"<qe/>-- and Henrietta did seem to like him.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="persuasion.c9.p7"><s sid="17" id="persuasion.c9.s17">Henrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came; but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="persuasion.c9.p8"><s sid="18" id="persuasion.c9.s18">Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet quite doubtful, as far as Anne's observation reached.</s> <s sid="19" id="persuasion.c9.s19">Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits; and she knew not now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="persuasion.c9.p9"><s sid="20" id="persuasion.c9.s20">Mr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters, and of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything to take its chance.</s> <s sid="21" id="persuasion.c9.s21">There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different at the Cottage:  the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder; and Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss Musgroves' company, and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared, when Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best.</s> <s sid="22" id="persuasion.c9.s22">Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for Henrietta, but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="persuasion.c9.p10" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="persuasion.c9.s23">Charles <qs/>"had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.</s> <s sid="24" id="persuasion.c9.s24">Here was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.</s> <s sid="25" id="persuasion.c9.s25">Oh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="persuasion.c9.p11" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="persuasion.c9.s26"><qs/>"Upon my word it would,"<qe/> replied Mary.</s> <s sid="27" id="persuasion.c9.s27"><qs/>"Dear me!</s> <s sid="28" id="persuasion.c9.s28">If he should rise to any very great honours!</s> <s sid="29" id="persuasion.c9.s29">If he should ever be made a baronet!</s> <s sid="30" id="persuasion.c9.s30">`Lady Wentworth' sounds very well.</s> <s sid="31" id="persuasion.c9.s31">That would be a noble thing, indeed, for Henrietta!</s> <s sid="32" id="persuasion.c9.s32">She would take place of me then, and Henrietta would not dislike that.</s> <s sid="33" id="persuasion.c9.s33">Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!</s> <s sid="34" id="persuasion.c9.s34">It would be but a new creation, however, and I never think much of your new creations."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="persuasion.c9.p12"><s sid="35" id="persuasion.c9.s35">It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to.</s> <s sid="36" id="persuasion.c9.s36">She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters, and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="persuasion.c9.p13" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="persuasion.c9.s37"><qs/>"You know,"<qe/><sss/> said she, <sse/><qs/>"I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made, she has no right to throw herself away.</s> <s sid="38" id="persuasion.c9.s38">I do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them.</s> <s sid="39" id="persuasion.c9.s39">And, pray, who is Charles Hayter?</s> <s sid="40" id="persuasion.c9.s40">Nothing but a country curate.</s> <s sid="41" id="persuasion.c9.s41">A most improper match for Miss Musgrove of Uppercross."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="persuasion.c9.p14"><s sid="42" id="persuasion.c9.s42">Her husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having a regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son, and he saw things as an eldest son himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="persuasion.c9.p15" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="persuasion.c9.s43"><qs/>"Now you are talking nonsense, Mary,"<qe/> was therefore his answer.</s> <s sid="44" id="persuasion.c9.s44"><qs/>"It would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has a very fair chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from the Bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember, that he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very pretty property.</s> <s sid="45" id="persuasion.c9.s45">The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the best land in the country.</s> <s sid="46" id="persuasion.c9.s46">I grant you, that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible; but he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it, and live in a very different sort of way; and with that property, he will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property.</s> <s sid="47" id="persuasion.c9.s47">No, no; Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him, and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="persuasion.c9.p16" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="persuasion.c9.s48"><qs/>"Charles may say what he pleases,"<qe/><sls/> cried Mary to Anne, as soon as he was out of the room, <sle/><qs/>"but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse for me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt that he has.</s> <s sid="49" id="persuasion.c9.s49">She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.</s> <s sid="50" id="persuasion.c9.s50">I wish you had been there to see her behaviour.</s> <s sid="51" id="persuasion.c9.s51">And as to Captain Wentworth's liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense to say so; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.</s> <s sid="52" id="persuasion.c9.s52">But Charles is so positive!</s> <s sid="53" id="persuasion.c9.s53">I wish you had been with us yesterday, for then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you would have thought as I did, unless you had been determined to give it against me."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="persuasion.c9.p17"><s sid="54" id="persuasion.c9.s54">A dinner at Mr Musgrove's had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home, under the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return of indisposition in little Charles.</s> <s sid="55" id="persuasion.c9.s55">She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="persuasion.c9.p18"><s sid="56" id="persuasion.c9.s56">As to Captain Wentworth's views, she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour, than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.</s> <s sid="57" id="persuasion.c9.s57">Either of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate, good-humoured wife.</s> <s sid="58" id="persuasion.c9.s58">With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings, the alternation could not be understood too soon.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="persuasion.c9.p19"><s sid="59" id="persuasion.c9.s59">Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin's behaviour.</s> <s sid="60" id="persuasion.c9.s60">She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross:  but there was such a change as became very alarming, when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause.</s> <s sid="61" id="persuasion.c9.s61">He had been absent only two Sundays, and when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy, and obtaining that of Uppercross instead.</s> <s sid="62" id="persuasion.c9.s62">It had then seemed the object nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office, but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it.</s> <s sid="63" id="persuasion.c9.s63">The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of going six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr Shirley's being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to Louisa, but had been almost everything to Henrietta.</s> <s sid="64" id="persuasion.c9.s64">When he came back, alas! the zeal of the business was gone by.</s> <s sid="65" id="persuasion.c9.s65">Louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley: she was at a window, looking out for Captain Wentworth; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="persuasion.c9.p20" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="persuasion.c9.s66"><qs/>"Well, I am very glad indeed:  but I always thought you would have it; I always thought you sure.</s> <s sid="67" id="persuasion.c9.s67">It did not appear to me that--in short, you know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.</s> <s sid="68" id="persuasion.c9.s68">Is he coming, Louisa?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="persuasion.c9.p21"><s sid="69" id="persuasion.c9.s69">One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves, at which Anne had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing-room at the Cottage, where were only herself and the little invalid Charles, who was lying on the sofa.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="persuasion.c9.p22" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="persuasion.c9.s70">The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot, deprived his manners of their usual composure:  he started, and could only say, <qs/>"I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here:</s> <s sid="71" id="persuasion.c9.s71">Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here,"<qe/> before he walked to the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="persuasion.c9.p23" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="persuasion.c9.s72"><qs/>"They are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few moments, I dare say,"<qe/> had been Anne's reply, in all the confusion that was natural; and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him, she would have been out of the room the next moment, and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="persuasion.c9.p24" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="persuasion.c9.s73">He continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying, <qs/>"I hope the little boy is better,"<qe/> was silent.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="persuasion.c9.p25"><s sid="74" id="persuasion.c9.s74">She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there to satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes, when, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule.</s> <s sid="75" id="persuasion.c9.s75">She hoped, on turning her head, to see the master of the house; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy--Charles Hayter, probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="persuasion.c9.p26" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="persuasion.c9.s76">She only attempted to say, <qs/>"How do you do?</s> <s sid="77" id="persuasion.c9.s77">Will you not sit down?</s> <s sid="78" id="persuasion.c9.s78">The others will be here presently."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="persuasion.c9.p27"><s sid="79" id="persuasion.c9.s79">Captain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently not ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up the newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="persuasion.c9.p28"><s sid="80" id="persuasion.c9.s80">Another minute brought another addition.</s> <s sid="81" id="persuasion.c9.s81">The younger boy, a remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door opened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance among them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on, and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="persuasion.c9.p29"><s sid="82" id="persuasion.c9.s82">There being nothing to eat, he could only have some play; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother, he began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that, busy as she was about Charles, she could not shake him off.</s> <s sid="83" id="persuasion.c9.s83">She spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain.</s> <s sid="84" id="persuasion.c9.s84">Once she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="persuasion.c9.p30" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="persuasion.c9.s85"><qs/>"Walter,"<qe/><sss/> said she, <sse/><qs/>"get down this moment.</s> <s sid="86" id="persuasion.c9.s86">You are extremely troublesome.</s> <s sid="87" id="persuasion.c9.s87">I am very angry with you."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="persuasion.c9.p31" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="persuasion.c9.s88"><qs/>"Walter,"<qe/><sss/> cried Charles Hayter, <sse/><qs/>"why do you not do as you are bid?</s> <s sid="89" id="persuasion.c9.s89">Do not you hear your aunt speak?</s> <s sid="90" id="persuasion.c9.s90">Come to me, Walter, come to cousin Charles."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="persuasion.c9.p32"><s sid="91" id="persuasion.c9.s91">But not a bit did Walter stir.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="persuasion.c9.p33"><s sid="92" id="persuasion.c9.s92">In another moment, however, she found herself in the state of being released from him; some one was taking him from her, though he had bent down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away, before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="persuasion.c9.p34" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="persuasion.c9.s93">Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.</s> <s sid="94" id="persuasion.c9.s94">She could not even thank him.</s> <s sid="95" id="persuasion.c9.s95">She could only hang over little Charles, with most disordered feelings.</s> <s sid="96" id="persuasion.c9.s96">His kindness in stepping forward to her relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed, the little particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child, that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants, produced such a confusion of varying, but very painful agitation, as she could not recover from, till enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares, and leave the room.</s> <s sid="97" id="persuasion.c9.s97">She could not stay.</s> <s sid="98" id="persuasion.c9.s98">It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four-- they were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it.</s> <s sid="99" id="persuasion.c9.s99">It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards Captain Wentworth.</s> <s sid="100" id="persuasion.c9.s100">She had a strong impression of his having said, in a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth's interference, <qs/>"You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to teaze your aunt;"<qe/> and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself.</s> <s sid="101" id="persuasion.c9.s101">But neither Charles Hayter's feelings, nor anybody's feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better arranged her own.</s> <s sid="102" id="persuasion.c9.s102">She was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed of being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was, and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="2" id="persuasion.c11.p2"><s sid="2" id="persuasion.c11.s2">It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth, within half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church, and there must be intercourse between the two families.</s> <s sid="3" id="persuasion.c11.s3">This was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time at Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole, she believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer, almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society, in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="persuasion.c11.p3"><s sid="4" id="persuasion.c11.s4">She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain Wentworth at the Hall:  those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere.</s> <s sid="5" id="persuasion.c11.s5">They did not like each other, and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good; and were Lady Russell to see them together, she might think that he had too much self-possession, and she too little.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="persuasion.c11.p4"><s sid="6" id="persuasion.c11.s6">These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough.</s> <s sid="7" id="persuasion.c11.s7">Her usefulness to little Charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months' visit there, but he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="persuasion.c11.p6"><s sid="10" id="persuasion.c11.s10">A letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at last, had brought intelligence of Captain Harville's being settled with his family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore, quite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.</s> <s sid="11" id="persuasion.c11.s11">Captain Harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before, and Captain Wentworth's anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to Lyme.</s> <s sid="12" id="persuasion.c11.s12">He had been there for four-and-twenty hours.</s> <s sid="13" id="persuasion.c11.s13">His acquittal was complete, his friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend, and his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to by the party, that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves, and a project for going thither was the consequence.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="persuasion.c11.p7"><s sid="14" id="persuasion.c11.s14">The young people were all wild to see Lyme.</s> <s sid="15" id="persuasion.c11.s15">Captain Wentworth talked of going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross; though November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short, Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed the resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked, being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way, bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer; and to Lyme they were to go--Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta, Louisa, and Captain Wentworth.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="persuasion.c11.p8"><s sid="16" id="persuasion.c11.s16">The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night; but to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent; and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place, after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required, for going and returning.</s> <s sid="17" id="persuasion.c11.s17">They were, consequently, to stay the night there, and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner.</s> <s sid="18" id="persuasion.c11.s18">This was felt to be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great House at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually, it was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove's coach containing the four ladies, and Charles's curricle, in which he drove Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme, and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself, that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were gone.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="persuasion.c11.p9"><s sid="19" id="persuasion.c11.s19">After securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns, the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea.</s> <s sid="20" id="persuasion.c11.s20">They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer.</s> <s sid="21" id="persuasion.c11.s21">The rooms were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better.</s> <s sid="22" id="persuasion.c11.s22">The scenes in its neighbourhood, Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country, and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs, where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme; and, above all, Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth, declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state, where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed Isle of Wight:  these places must be visited, and visited again, to make the worth of Lyme understood.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="persuasion.c11.p10"><s sid="23" id="persuasion.c11.s23">The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves on the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all, proceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself and on Captain Wentworth's account:  for in a small house, near the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled.</s> <s sid="24" id="persuasion.c11.s24">Captain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on, and he was to join them on the Cobb.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="persuasion.c11.p11"><s sid="25" id="persuasion.c11.s25">They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long, when they saw him coming after them, with three companions, all well known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville, and a Captain Benwick, who was staying with them.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="persuasion.c11.p12"><s sid="26" id="persuasion.c11.s26">Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia; and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him, on his return from Lyme before, his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly, which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener, had been followed by a little history of his private life, which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies.</s> <s sid="27" id="persuasion.c11.s27">He had been engaged to Captain Harville's sister, and was now mourning her loss.</s> <s sid="28" id="persuasion.c11.s28">They had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion.</s> <s sid="29" id="persuasion.c11.s29">Fortune came, his prize-money as lieutenant being great; promotion, too, came at last; but Fanny Harville did not live to know it.</s> <s sid="30" id="persuasion.c11.s30">She had died the preceding summer while he was at sea.</s> <s sid="31" id="persuasion.c11.s31">Captain Wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change.</s> <s sid="32" id="persuasion.c11.s32">He considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings with quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading, and sedentary pursuits.</s> <s sid="33" id="persuasion.c11.s33">To finish the interest of the story, the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed, if possible, augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance, and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely.</s> <s sid="34" id="persuasion.c11.s34">Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health, and his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive, and by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick's state of mind.</s> <s sid="35" id="persuasion.c11.s35">The sympathy and good-will excited towards Captain Benwick was very great.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="persuasion.c11.p15"><s sid="44" id="persuasion.c11.s44">Captain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners, was a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.</s> <s sid="45" id="persuasion.c11.s45">Mrs Harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however, to have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own, because the friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.</s> <s sid="46" id="persuasion.c11.s46">The dinner, already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly, accepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth should have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="persuasion.c11.p16" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="persuasion.c11.s47">There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this, and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon, so unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners of formality and display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.</s> <s sid="48" id="persuasion.c11.s48"><qs/>"These would have been all my friends,"<qe/> was her thought; and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="persuasion.c11.p18"><s sid="52" id="persuasion.c11.s52">Captain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived excellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves, for a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of Captain Benwick.</s> <s sid="53" id="persuasion.c11.s53">His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise; but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within.</s> <s sid="54" id="persuasion.c11.s54">He drew, he varnished, he carpentered, he glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles and pins with improvements; and if everything else was done, sat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="persuasion.c11.p19"><s sid="55" id="persuasion.c11.s55">Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking, burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness, their uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England; that they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be respected and loved.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="persuasion.c11.p20" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="persuasion.c11.s56">They went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme answered already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being <qs/>"so entirely out of season,"<qe/><sss/> and the <sse/><qs/>"no thoroughfare of Lyme,"<qe/><sss/> and the <sse/><qs/>"no expectation of company,"<qe/> had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="persuasion.c11.p21"><s sid="57" id="persuasion.c11.s57">Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in Captain Wentworth's company than she had at first imagined could ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now, and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it (they never got beyond), was become a mere nothing.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="persuasion.c11.p22"><s sid="58" id="persuasion.c11.s58">The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow, but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening; and he came, bringing his friend also, which was more than had been expected, it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers.</s> <s sid="59" id="persuasion.c11.s59">He ventured among them again, however, though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="persuasion.c11.p24"><s sid="64" id="persuasion.c11.s64">His looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion to his situation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested to particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists, such collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering, as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts, and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="persuasion.c11.p25"><s sid="65" id="persuasion.c11.s65">Captain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for the interest implied; and though with a shake of the head, and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended, and promised to procure and read them.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="persuasion.c11.p26"><s sid="66" id="persuasion.c11.s66">When the evening was over, Anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing, on more serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists and preachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="2" id="persuasion.c17.p2"><s sid="2" id="persuasion.c17.s2">She had called on her former governess, and had heard from her of there being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering.</s> <s sid="3" id="persuasion.c17.s3">Miss Hamilton, now Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable.</s> <s sid="4" id="persuasion.c17.s4">Anne had gone unhappy to school, grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved, feeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen, of strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time; and Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the want of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school, had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="persuasion.c17.p3"><s sid="5" id="persuasion.c17.s5">Miss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards, was said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all that Anne had known of her, till now that their governess's account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="persuasion.c17.p4"><s sid="6" id="persuasion.c17.s6">She was a widow and poor.</s> <s sid="7" id="persuasion.c17.s7">Her husband had been extravagant; and at his death, about two years before, had left his affairs dreadfully involved.</s> <s sid="8" id="persuasion.c17.s8">She had had difficulties of every sort to contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs, had made her for the present a cripple.</s> <s sid="9" id="persuasion.c17.s9">She had come to Bath on that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths, living in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself the comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="persuasion.c17.p5"><s sid="10" id="persuasion.c17.s10">Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore lost no time in going.</s> <s sid="11" id="persuasion.c17.s11">She mentioned nothing of what she had heard, or what she intended, at home.</s> <s sid="12" id="persuasion.c17.s12">It would excite no proper interest there.</s> <s sid="13" id="persuasion.c17.s13">She only consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments, and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith's lodgings in Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="persuasion.c17.p6"><s sid="14" id="persuasion.c17.s14">The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest in each other more than re-kindled.</s> <s sid="15" id="persuasion.c17.s15">The first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion.</s> <s sid="16" id="persuasion.c17.s16">Twelve years were gone since they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined.</s> <s sid="17" id="persuasion.c17.s17">Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant little woman of seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom, and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle; and twelve years had transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton, in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor, infirm, helpless widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="persuasion.c17.p7"><s sid="18" id="persuasion.c17.s18">Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation.</s> <s sid="19" id="persuasion.c17.s19">Neither the dissipations of the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions of the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="persuasion.c17.p8"><s sid="20" id="persuasion.c17.s20">In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness, and Anne's astonishment increased.</s> <s sid="21" id="persuasion.c17.s21">She could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith's.</s> <s sid="22" id="persuasion.c17.s22">She had been very fond of her husband:  she had buried him.</s> <s sid="23" id="persuasion.c17.s23">She had been used to affluence:  it was gone.</s> <s sid="24" id="persuasion.c17.s24">She had no child to connect her with life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable.</s> <s sid="25" id="persuasion.c17.s25">Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom behind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford, and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.</s> <s sid="26" id="persuasion.c17.s26">Yet, in spite of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation and enjoyment.</s> <s sid="27" id="persuasion.c17.s27">How could it be?</s> <s sid="28" id="persuasion.c17.s28">She watched, observed, reflected, and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only.</s> <s sid="29" id="persuasion.c17.s29">A submissive spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment which carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone.</s> <s sid="30" id="persuasion.c17.s30">It was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment, it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="persuasion.c17.p9" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="persuasion.c17.s31">There had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits had nearly failed.</s> <s sid="32" id="persuasion.c17.s32">She could not call herself an invalid now, compared with her state on first reaching Bath.</s> <s sid="33" id="persuasion.c17.s33">Then she had, indeed, been a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey, and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense.</s> <s sid="34" id="persuasion.c17.s34">She had weathered it, however, and could truly say that it had done her good.</s> <s sid="35" id="persuasion.c17.s35">It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands.</s> <s sid="36" id="persuasion.c17.s36">She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady, a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.</s> <s sid="37" id="persuasion.c17.s37"><qs/>"And she,"<qe/><sss/> said Mrs Smith, <sse/><qs/>"besides nursing me most admirably, has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.</s> <s sid="38" id="persuasion.c17.s38">As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement; and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.</s> <s sid="39" id="persuasion.c17.s39">She had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those who can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.</s> <s sid="40" id="persuasion.c17.s40">She always takes the right time for applying.</s> <s sid="41" id="persuasion.c17.s41">Everybody's heart is open, you know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering the blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to speak.</s> <s sid="42" id="persuasion.c17.s42">She is a shrewd, intelligent, sensible woman.</s> <s sid="43" id="persuasion.c17.s43">Hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she has a fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received `the best education in the world,' know nothing worth attending to.</s> <s sid="44" id="persuasion.c17.s44">Call it gossip, if you will, but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour's leisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable:  something that makes one know one's species better.</s> <s sid="45" id="persuasion.c17.s45">One likes to hear what is going on, to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly.</s> <s sid="46" id="persuasion.c17.s46">To me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I assure you, is a treat."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="persuasion.c17.p10" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="persuasion.c17.s47">Anne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied, <qs/>"I can easily believe it.</s> <s sid="48" id="persuasion.c17.s48">Women of that class have great opportunities, and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to.</s> <s sid="49" id="persuasion.c17.s49">Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!</s> <s sid="50" id="persuasion.c17.s50">And it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting.</s> <s sid="51" id="persuasion.c17.s51">What instances must pass before them of ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude, patience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most.</s> <s sid="52" id="persuasion.c17.s52">A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="persuasion.c17.p11" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="persuasion.c17.s53"><qs/>"Yes,"<qe/> said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, "sometimes it may, though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.</s> <s sid="54" id="persuasion.c17.s54">Here and there, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.</s> <s sid="55" id="persuasion.c17.s55">There is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately" (speaking low and tremulously) <qs/>"there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="persuasion.c17.p12"><s sid="56" id="persuasion.c17.s56">Anne saw the misery of such feelings.</s> <s sid="57" id="persuasion.c17.s57">The husband had not been what he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.</s> <s sid="58" id="persuasion.c17.s58">It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off, and soon added in a different tone--</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="persuasion.c17.p13" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="persuasion.c17.s59"><qs/>"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present, will furnish much either to interest or edify me.</s> <s sid="60" id="persuasion.c17.s60">She is only nursing Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive, fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery.</s> <s sid="61" id="persuasion.c17.s61">I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis, however.</s> <s sid="62" id="persuasion.c17.s62">She has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all the high-priced things I have in hand now."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="persuasion.c17.p14" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="persuasion.c17.s63">Anne had called several times on her friend, before the existence of such a person was known in Camden Place.</s> <s sid="64" id="persuasion.c17.s64">At last, it became necessary to speak of her.</s> <s sid="65" id="persuasion.c17.s65">Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one morning from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that evening in Westgate Buildings.</s> <s sid="66" id="persuasion.c17.s66">She was not sorry for the excuse.</s> <s sid="67" id="persuasion.c17.s67">They were only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account with great alacrity--<qs/>"She was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow."<qe/></s> <s sid="68" id="persuasion.c17.s68">They were not much interested in anything relative to Anne; but still there were questions enough asked, to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth was disdainful, and Sir Walter severe.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="persuasion.c17.p15" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="persuasion.c17.s69"><qs/>"Westgate Buildings!"<qe/><sss/> said he, <sse/><qs/>"and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be visiting in Westgate Buildings?</s> <s sid="70" id="persuasion.c17.s70">A Mrs Smith.</s> <s sid="71" id="persuasion.c17.s71">A widow Mrs Smith; and who was her husband?</s> <s sid="72" id="persuasion.c17.s72">One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere.</s> <s sid="73" id="persuasion.c17.s73">And what is her attraction?</s> <s sid="74" id="persuasion.c17.s74">That she is old and sickly.</s> <s sid="75" id="persuasion.c17.s75">Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot, you have the most extraordinary taste!</s> <s sid="76" id="persuasion.c17.s76">Everything that revolts other people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations are inviting to you.</s> <s sid="77" id="persuasion.c17.s77">But surely you may put off this old lady till to-morrow:  she is not so near her end, I presume, but that she may hope to see another day.</s> <s sid="78" id="persuasion.c17.s78">What is her age?</s> <s sid="79" id="persuasion.c17.s79">Forty?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="persuasion.c17.p17" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="persuasion.c17.s82"><qs/>"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?"<qe/> asked Elizabeth.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="persuasion.c17.p18" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="persuasion.c17.s83"><qs/>"She sees nothing to blame in it,"<qe/><sss/> replied Anne; <sse/><qs/>"on the contrary, she approves it, and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs Smith."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="persuasion.c17.p20"><s sid="90" id="persuasion.c17.s90">Mrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it advisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much, and did long to say a little in defence of her friend's not very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her.</s> <s sid="91" id="persuasion.c17.s91">She made no reply.</s> <s sid="92" id="persuasion.c17.s92">She left it to himself to recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on, and no surname of dignity.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="persuasion.c17.p21"><s sid="93" id="persuasion.c17.s93">Anne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.</s> <s sid="94" id="persuasion.c17.s94">She had been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship's service themselves, but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others, and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early, and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her.</s> <s sid="95" id="persuasion.c17.s95">Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell.</s> <s sid="96" id="persuasion.c17.s96">To her, its greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of between her friend and Mr Elliot; in having been wished for, regretted, and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause.</s> <s sid="97" id="persuasion.c17.s97">Her kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow, sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot.</s> <s sid="98" id="persuasion.c17.s98">He thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners, mind, a model of female excellence.</s> <s sid="99" id="persuasion.c17.s99">He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="persuasion.c17.p22"><s sid="100" id="persuasion.c17.s100">Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot.</s> <s sid="101" id="persuasion.c17.s101">She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood, and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.</s> <s sid="102" id="persuasion.c17.s102">She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject, she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter, of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance, supposing such attachment to be real and returned.</s> <s sid="103" id="persuasion.c17.s103">Anne heard her, and made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed, and gently shook her head.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="persuasion.c17.p23" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="persuasion.c17.s104"><qs/>"I am no match-maker, as you well know,"<qe/><sss/> said Lady Russell, <sse/><qs/>"being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations.</s> <s sid="105" id="persuasion.c17.s105">I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him, I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together.</s> <s sid="106" id="persuasion.c17.s106">A most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think it might be a very happy one."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="persuasion.c17.p28"><s sid="126" id="persuasion.c17.s126">Mr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.</s> <s sid="127" id="persuasion.c17.s127">There was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight, at the evil or good of others.</s> <s sid="128" id="persuasion.c17.s128">This, to Anne, was a decided imperfection.</s> <s sid="129" id="persuasion.c17.s129">Her early impressions were incurable.</s> <s sid="130" id="persuasion.c17.s130">She prized the frank, the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.</s> <s sid="131" id="persuasion.c17.s131">Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still.</s> <s sid="132" id="persuasion.c17.s132">She felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind never varied, whose tongue never slipped.</s> </p>
