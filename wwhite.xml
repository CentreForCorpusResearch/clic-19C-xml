<stru>The Woman in White



by

Wilkie Collins</stru>











THE STORY BEGUN BY WALTER HARTRIGHT

(of Clement's Inn, Teacher of Drawing)





This is the story of what a Woman's patience can endure, and what

a Man's resolution can achieve.



If the machinery of the Law could be depended on to fathom every

case of suspicion, and to conduct every process of inquiry, with

moderate assistance only from the lubricating influences of oil of

gold, the events which fill these pages might have claimed their

share of the public attention in a Court of Justice.



But the Law is still, in certain inevitable cases, the pre-engaged

servant of the long purse; and the story is left to be told, for

the first time, in this place.  As the Judge might once have heard

it, so the Reader shall hear it now.  No circumstance of

importance, from the beginning to the end of the disclosure, shall

be related on hearsay evidence.  When the writer of these

introductory lines (Walter Hartright by name) happens to be more

closely connected than others with the incidents to be recorded,

he will describe them in his own person.  When his experience

fails, he will retire from the position of narrator; and his task

will be continued, from the point at which he has left it off, by

other persons who can speak to the circumstances under notice from

their own knowledge, just as clearly and positively as he has

spoken before them.



Thus, the story here presented will be told by more than one pen,

as the story of an offence against the laws is told in Court by

more than one witness--with the same object, in both cases, to

present the truth always in its most direct and most intelligible

aspect; and to trace the course of one complete series of events,

by making the persons who have been most closely connected with

them, at each successive stage, relate their own experience, word

for word.



Let Walter Hartright, teacher of drawing, aged twenty-eight years,

be heard first.

<p pid="1" id="wwhite.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="wwhite.c1.s1">It was the last day of July.</s> <s sid="2" id="wwhite.c1.s2">The long hot summer was drawing to a close; and we, the weary pilgrims of the London pavement, were beginning to think of the cloud-shadows on the corn-fields, and the autumn breezes on the sea-shore.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="wwhite.c1.p2"><s sid="3" id="wwhite.c1.s3">For my own poor part, the fading summer left me out of health, out of spirits, and, if the truth must be told, out of money as well.</s> <s sid="4" id="wwhite.c1.s4">During the past year I had not managed my professional resources as carefully as usual; and my extravagance now limited me to the prospect of spending the autumn economically between my mother's cottage at Hampstead and my own chambers in town.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="wwhite.c1.p3"><s sid="5" id="wwhite.c1.s5">The evening, I remember, was still and cloudy; the London air was at its heaviest; the distant hum of the street-traffic was at its faintest; the small pulse of the life within me, and the great heart of the city around me, seemed to be sinking in unison, languidly and more languidly, with the sinking sun.</s> <s sid="6" id="wwhite.c1.s6">I roused myself from the book which I was dreaming over rather than reading, and left my chambers to meet the cool night air in the suburbs.</s> <s sid="7" id="wwhite.c1.s7">It was one of the two evenings in every week which I was accustomed to spend with my mother and my sister.</s> <s sid="8" id="wwhite.c1.s8">So I turned my steps northward in the direction of Hampstead.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="wwhite.c1.p4"><s sid="9" id="wwhite.c1.s9">Events which I have yet to relate make it necessary to mention in this place that my father had been dead some years at the period of which I am now writing; and that my sister Sarah and I were the sole survivors of a family of five children.</s> <s sid="10" id="wwhite.c1.s10">My father was a drawing-master before me.</s> <s sid="11" id="wwhite.c1.s11">His exertions had made him highly successful in his profession; and his affectionate anxiety to provide for the future of those who were dependent on his labours had impelled him, from the time of his marriage, to devote to the insuring of his life a much larger portion of his income than most men consider it necessary to set aside for that purpose.</s> <s sid="12" id="wwhite.c1.s12">Thanks to his admirable prudence and self-denial my mother and sister were left, after his death, as independent of the world as they had been during his lifetime.</s> <s sid="13" id="wwhite.c1.s13">I succeeded to his connection, and had every reason to feel grateful for the prospect that awaited me at my starting in life.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="wwhite.c1.p5"><s sid="14" id="wwhite.c1.s14">The quiet twilight was still trembling on the topmost ridges of the heath; and the view of London below me had sunk into a black gulf in the shadow of the cloudy night, when I stood before the gate of my mother's cottage.</s> <s sid="15" id="wwhite.c1.s15">I had hardly rung the bell before the house door was opened violently; my worthy Italian friend, Professor Pesca, appeared in the servant's place; and darted out joyously to receive me, with a shrill foreign parody on an English cheer.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="wwhite.c1.p6"><s sid="16" id="wwhite.c1.s16">On his own account, and, I must be allowed to add, on mine also, the Professor merits the honour of a formal introduction.</s> <s sid="17" id="wwhite.c1.s17">Accident has made him the starting-point of the strange family story which it is the purpose of these pages to unfold.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="wwhite.c1.p7"><s sid="18" id="wwhite.c1.s18">I had first become acquainted with my Italian friend by meeting him at certain great houses where he taught his own language and I taught drawing.</s> <s sid="19" id="wwhite.c1.s19">All I then knew of the history of his life was, that he had once held a situation in the University of Padua; that he had left Italy for political reasons (the nature of which he uniformly declined to mention to any one); and that he had been for many years respectably established in London as a teacher of languages.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="wwhite.c1.p8"><s sid="20" id="wwhite.c1.s20">Without being actually a dwarf--for he was perfectly well proportioned from head to foot--Pesca was, I think, the smallest human being I ever saw out of a show-room.</s> <s sid="21" id="wwhite.c1.s21">Remarkable anywhere, by his personal appearance, he was still further distinguished among the rank and file of mankind by the harmless eccentricity of his character.</s> <s sid="22" id="wwhite.c1.s22">The ruling idea of his life appeared to be, that he was bound to show his gratitude to the country which had afforded him an asylum and a means of subsistence by doing his utmost to turn himself into an Englishman.</s> <s sid="23" id="wwhite.c1.s23">Not content with paying the nation in general the compliment of invariably carrying an umbrella, and invariably wearing gaiters and a white hat, the Professor further aspired to become an Englishman in his habits and amusements, as well as in his personal appearance.</s> <s sid="24" id="wwhite.c1.s24">Finding us distinguished, as a nation, by our love of athletic exercises, the little man, in the innocence of his heart, devoted himself impromptu to all our English sports and pastimes whenever he had the opportunity of joining them; firmly persuaded that he could adopt our national amusements of the field by an effort of will precisely as he had adopted our national gaiters and our national white hat.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="wwhite.c1.p9"><s sid="25" id="wwhite.c1.s25">I had seen him risk his limbs blindly at a fox-hunt and in a cricket-field; and soon afterwards I saw him risk his life, just as blindly, in the sea at Brighton.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="wwhite.c1.p10"><s sid="26" id="wwhite.c1.s26">We had met there accidentally, and were bathing together.</s> <s sid="27" id="wwhite.c1.s27">If we had been engaged in any exercise peculiar to my own nation I should, of course, have looked after Pesca carefully; but as foreigners are generally quite as well able to take care of themselves in the water as Englishmen, it never occurred to me that the art of swimming might merely add one more to the list of manly exercises which the Professor believed that he could learn impromptu.</s> <s sid="28" id="wwhite.c1.s28">Soon after we had both struck out from shore, I stopped, finding my friend did not gain on me, and turned round to look for him.</s> <s sid="29" id="wwhite.c1.s29">To my horror and amazement, I saw nothing between me and the beach but two little white arms which struggled for an instant above the surface of the water, and then disappeared from view.</s> <s sid="30" id="wwhite.c1.s30">When I dived for him, the poor little man was lying quietly coiled up at the bottom, in a hollow of shingle, looking by many degrees smaller than I had ever seen him look before.</s> <s sid="31" id="wwhite.c1.s31">During the few minutes that elapsed while I was taking him in, the air revived him, and he ascended the steps of the machine with my assistance.</s> <s sid="32" id="wwhite.c1.s32">With the partial recovery of his animation came the return of his wonderful delusion on the subject of swimming.</s> <s sid="33" id="wwhite.c1.s33">As soon as his chattering teeth would let him speak, he smiled vacantly, and said he thought it must have been the Cramp.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="wwhite.c1.p11"><s sid="34" id="wwhite.c1.s34">When he had thoroughly recovered himself, and had joined me on the beach, his warm Southern nature broke through all artificial English restraints in a moment.</s> <s sid="35" id="wwhite.c1.s35">He overwhelmed me with the wildest expressions of affection--exclaimed passionately, in his exaggerated Italian way, that he would hold his life henceforth at my disposal--and declared that he should never be happy again until he had found an opportunity of proving his gratitude by rendering me some service which I might remember, on my side, to the end of my days.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="wwhite.c1.p12"><s sid="36" id="wwhite.c1.s36">I did my best to stop the torrent of his tears and protestations by persisting in treating the whole adventure as a good subject for a joke; and succeeded at last, as I imagined, in lessening Pesca's overwhelming sense of obligation to me.</s> <s sid="37" id="wwhite.c1.s37">Little did I think then--little did I think afterwards when our pleasant holiday had drawn to an end--that the opportunity of serving me for which my grateful companion so ardently longed was soon to come; that he was eagerly to seize it on the instant; and that by so doing he was to turn the whole current of my existence into a new channel, and to alter me to myself almost past recognition.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="wwhite.c1.p13"><s sid="38" id="wwhite.c1.s38">Yet so it was.</s> <s sid="39" id="wwhite.c1.s39">If I had not dived for Professor Pesca when he lay under water on his shingle bed, I should in all human probability never have been connected with the story which these pages will relate--I should never, perhaps, have heard even the name of the woman who has lived in all my thoughts, who has possessed herself of all my energies, who has become the one guiding influence that now directs the purpose of my life.</s> </p></div>

<title>III</title>

<p pid="1" id="wwhite.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="wwhite.c2.s1">Pesca's face and manner, on the evening when we confronted each other at my mother's gate, were more than sufficient to inform me that something extraordinary had happened.</s> <s sid="2" id="wwhite.c2.s2">It was quite useless, however, to ask him for an immediate explanation.</s> <s sid="3" id="wwhite.c2.s3">I could only conjecture, while he was dragging me in by both hands, that (knowing my habits) he had come to the cottage to make sure of meeting me that night, and that he had some news to tell of an unusually agreeable kind.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="wwhite.c2.p2"><s sid="4" id="wwhite.c2.s4">We both bounced into the parlour in a highly abrupt and undignified manner.</s> <s sid="5" id="wwhite.c2.s5">My mother sat by the open window laughing and fanning herself.</s> <s sid="6" id="wwhite.c2.s6">Pesca was one of her especial favourites and his wildest eccentricities were always pardonable in her eyes.</s> <s sid="7" id="wwhite.c2.s7">Poor dear soul! from the first moment when she found out that the little Professor was deeply and gratefully attached to her son, she opened her heart to him unreservedly, and took all his puzzling foreign peculiarities for granted, without so much as attempting to understand any one of them.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="wwhite.c2.p3"><s sid="8" id="wwhite.c2.s8">My sister Sarah, with all the advantages of youth, was, strangely enough, less pliable.</s> <s sid="9" id="wwhite.c2.s9">She did full justice to Pesca's excellent qualities of heart; but she could not accept him implicitly, as my mother accepted him, for my sake.</s> <s sid="10" id="wwhite.c2.s10">Her insular notions of propriety rose in perpetual revolt against Pesca's constitutional contempt for appearances; and she was always more or less undisguisedly astonished at her mother's familiarity with the eccentric little foreigner.</s> <s sid="11" id="wwhite.c2.s11">I have observed, not only in my sister's case, but in the instances of others, that we of the young generation are nothing like so hearty and so impulsive as some of our elders.</s> <s sid="12" id="wwhite.c2.s12">I constantly see old people flushed and excited by the prospect of some anticipated pleasure which altogether fails to ruffle the tranquillity of their serene grandchildren.</s> <s sid="13" id="wwhite.c2.s13">Are we, I wonder, quite such genuine boys and girls now as our seniors were in their time?</s> <s sid="14" id="wwhite.c2.s14">Has the great advance in education taken rather too long a stride; and are we in these modern days, just the least trifle in the world too well brought up?</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="wwhite.c2.p4"><s sid="15" id="wwhite.c2.s15">Without attempting to answer those questions decisively, I may at least record that I never saw my mother and my sister together in Pesca's society, without finding my mother much the younger woman of the two.</s> <s sid="16" id="wwhite.c2.s16">On this occasion, for example, while the old lady was laughing heartily over the boyish manner in which we tumbled into the parlour, Sarah was perturbedly picking up the broken pieces of a teacup, which the Professor had knocked off the table in his precipitate advance to meet me at the door.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="wwhite.c2.p5" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="wwhite.c2.s17"><qs/>"I don't know what would have happened, Walter,"<qe/><sss/> said my mother, <sse/><qs/>"if you had delayed much longer.</s> <s sid="18" id="wwhite.c2.s18">Pesca has been half mad with impatience, and I have been half mad with curiosity.</s> <s sid="19" id="wwhite.c2.s19">The Professor has brought some wonderful news with him, in which he says you are concerned; and he has cruelly refused to give us the smallest hint of it till his friend Walter appeared."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="wwhite.c2.p6" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="wwhite.c2.s20"><qs/>"Very provoking: it spoils the Set,"<qe/> murmured Sarah to herself, mournfully absorbed over the ruins of the broken cup.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="wwhite.c2.p7"><s sid="21" id="wwhite.c2.s21">While these words were being spoken, Pesca, happily and fussily unconscious of the irreparable wrong which the crockery had suffered at his hands, was dragging a large arm-chair to the opposite end of the room, so as to command us all three, in the character of a public speaker addressing an audience.</s> <s sid="22" id="wwhite.c2.s22">Having turned the chair with its back towards us, he jumped into it on his knees, and excitedly addressed his small congregation of three from an impromptu pulpit.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="wwhite.c2.p8" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="wwhite.c2.s23"><qs/>"Now, my good dears,"<qe/><sls/> began Pesca (who always said "good dears" when he meant "worthy friends"), <sle/><qs/>"listen to me.</s> <s sid="24" id="wwhite.c2.s24">The time has come--I recite my good news--I speak at last."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="wwhite.c2.p9" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="wwhite.c2.s25"><qs/>"Hear, hear!"<qe/> said my mother, humouring the joke.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="wwhite.c2.p10" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="wwhite.c2.s26"><qs/>"The next thing he will break, mamma,"<qe/><sss/> whispered Sarah, <sse/><qs/>"will be the back of the best arm-chair."<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="wwhite.c2.p11" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="wwhite.c2.s27"><qs/>"I go back into my life, and I address myself to the noblest of created beings,"<qe/> continued Pesca, vehemently apostrophising my unworthy self over the top rail of the chair.</s> <s sid="28" id="wwhite.c2.s28"><qs/>"Who found me dead at the bottom of the sea (through Cramp); and who pulled me up to the top; and what did I say when I got into my own life and my own clothes again?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="wwhite.c2.p12" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="wwhite.c2.s29"><qs/>"Much more than was at all necessary,"<qe/> I answered as doggedly as possible; for the least encouragement in connection with this subject invariably let loose the Professor's emotions in a flood of tears.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="wwhite.c2.p13" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="wwhite.c2.s30"><qs/>"I said,"<qe/><sss/> persisted Pesca, <sse/><qs/>"that my life belonged to my dear friend, Walter, for the rest of my days--and so it does.</s> <s sid="31" id="wwhite.c2.s31">I said that I should never be happy again till I had found the opportunity of doing a good Something for Walter--and I have never been contented with myself till this most blessed day.</s> <s sid="32" id="wwhite.c2.s32">Now,"<qe/><sls/> cried the enthusiastic little man at the top of his voice, <sle/><qs/>"the overflowing happiness bursts out of me at every pore of my skin, like a perspiration; for on my faith, and soul, and honour, the something is done at last, and the only word to say now is--Right- all-right!"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="wwhite.c2.p14"><s sid="33" id="wwhite.c2.s33">It may be necessary to explain here that Pesca prided himself on being a perfect Englishman in his language, as well as in his dress, manners, and amusements.</s> <s sid="34" id="wwhite.c2.s34">Having picked up a few of our most familiar colloquial expressions, he scattered them about over his conversation whenever they happened to occur to him, turning them, in his high relish for their sound and his general ignorance of their sense, into compound words and repetitions of his own, and always running them into each other, as if they consisted of one long syllable.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="wwhite.c2.p15" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="wwhite.c2.s35"><qs/>"Among the fine London Houses where I teach the language of my native country,"<qe/><sls/> said the Professor, rushing into his long- deferred explanation without another word of preface, <sle/><qs/>"there is one, mighty fine, in the big place called Portland.</s> <s sid="36" id="wwhite.c2.s36">You all know where that is?</s> <s sid="37" id="wwhite.c2.s37">Yes, yes--course-of-course.</s> <s sid="38" id="wwhite.c2.s38">The fine house, my good dears, has got inside it a fine family.</s> <s sid="39" id="wwhite.c2.s39">A Mamma, fair and fat; three young Misses, fair and fat; two young Misters, fair and fat; and a Papa, the fairest and the fattest of all, who is a mighty merchant, up to his eyes in gold--a fine man once, but seeing that he has got a naked head and two chins, fine no longer at the present time.</s> <s sid="40" id="wwhite.c2.s40">Now mind!</s> <s sid="41" id="wwhite.c2.s41">I teach the sublime Dante to the young Misses, and ah!--my-soul-bless-my-soul!--it is not in human language to say how the sublime Dante puzzles the pretty heads of all three!</s> <s sid="42" id="wwhite.c2.s42">No matter--all in good time--and the more lessons the better for me.</s> <s sid="43" id="wwhite.c2.s43">Now mind!</s> <s sid="44" id="wwhite.c2.s44">Imagine to yourselves that I am teaching the young Misses to-day, as usual.</s> <s sid="45" id="wwhite.c2.s45">We are all four of us down together in the Hell of Dante.</s> <s sid="46" id="wwhite.c2.s46">At the Seventh Circle--but no matter for that: all the Circles are alike to the three young Misses, fair and fat,--at the Seventh Circle, nevertheless, my pupils are sticking fast; and I, to set them going again, recite, explain, and blow myself up red-hot with useless enthusiasm, when-- a creak of boots in the passage outside, and in comes the golden Papa, the mighty merchant with the naked head and the two chins.-- Ha! my good dears, I am closer than you think for to the business, now.</s> <s sid="47" id="wwhite.c2.s47">Have you been patient so far? or have you said to yourselves, 'Deuce-what-the-deuce!</s> <s sid="48" id="wwhite.c2.s48">Pesca is long-winded to-night?'"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="wwhite.c3.p3"><s sid="4" id="wwhite.c3.s4">The moon was full and broad in the dark blue starless sky, and the broken ground of the heath looked wild enough in the mysterious light to be hundreds of miles away from the great city that lay beneath it.</s> <s sid="5" id="wwhite.c3.s5">The idea of descending any sooner than I could help into the heat and gloom of London repelled me.</s> <s sid="6" id="wwhite.c3.s6">The prospect of going to bed in my airless chambers, and the prospect of gradual suffocation, seemed, in my present restless frame of mind and body, to be one and the same thing.</s> <s sid="7" id="wwhite.c3.s7">I determined to stroll home in the purer air by the most roundabout way I could take; to follow the white winding paths across the lonely heath; and to approach London through its most open suburb by striking into the Finchley Road, and so getting back, in the cool of the new morning, by the western side of the Regent's Park.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="wwhite.c3.p4"><s sid="8" id="wwhite.c3.s8">I wound my way down slowly over the heath, enjoying the divine stillness of the scene, and admiring the soft alternations of light and shade as they followed each other over the broken ground on every side of me.</s> <s sid="9" id="wwhite.c3.s9">So long as I was proceeding through this first and prettiest part of my night walk my mind remained passively open to the impressions produced by the view; and I thought but little on any subject--indeed, so far as my own sensations were concerned, I can hardly say that I thought at all.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="wwhite.c16.p2"><s sid="2" id="wwhite.c16.s2">Sir Percival was in such boisterous high spirits that I hardly recognised him as the same man whose quiet tact, refinement, and good sense had impressed me so strongly at the interview of the morning.</s> <s sid="3" id="wwhite.c16.s3">The only trace of his former self that I could detect reappeared, every now and then, in his manner towards Miss Fairlie.</s> <s sid="4" id="wwhite.c16.s4">A look or a word from her suspended his loudest laugh, checked his gayest flow of talk, and rendered him all attention to her, and to no one else at table, in an instant.</s> <s sid="5" id="wwhite.c16.s5">Although he never openly tried to draw her into the conversation, he never lost the slightest chance she gave him of letting her drift into it by accident, and of saying the words to her, under those favourable circumstances, which a man with less tact and delicacy would have pointedly addressed to her the moment they occurred to him.</s> <s sid="6" id="wwhite.c16.s6">Rather to my surprise, Miss Fairlie appeared to be sensible of his attentions without being moved by them.</s> <s sid="7" id="wwhite.c16.s7">She was a little confused from time to time when he looked at her, or spoke to her; but she never warmed towards him.</s> <s sid="8" id="wwhite.c16.s8">Rank, fortune, good breeding, good looks, the respect of a gentleman, and the devotion of a lover were all humbly placed at her feet, and, so far as appearances went, were all offered in vain.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="wwhite.c16.p3"><s sid="9" id="wwhite.c16.s9">On the next day, the Tuesday, Sir Percival went in the morning (taking one of the servants with him as a guide) to Todd's Corner.</s> <s sid="10" id="wwhite.c16.s10">His inquiries, as I afterwards heard, led to no results.</s> <s sid="11" id="wwhite.c16.s11">On his return he had an interview with Mr. Fairlie, and in the afternoon he and Miss Halcombe rode out together.</s> <s sid="12" id="wwhite.c16.s12">Nothing else happened worthy of record.</s> <s sid="13" id="wwhite.c16.s13">The evening passed as usual.</s> <s sid="14" id="wwhite.c16.s14">There was no change in Sir Percival, and no change in Miss Fairlie.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="wwhite.c16.p8"><s sid="25" id="wwhite.c16.s25">The next duty to be accomplished, now that the answer had been received, was to acquaint Miss Fairlie with Sir Percival's explanation.</s> <s sid="26" id="wwhite.c16.s26">Miss Halcombe had undertaken to do this, and had left the room to go to her sister, when she suddenly returned again, and sat down by the easy-chair in which I was reading the newspaper.</s> <s sid="27" id="wwhite.c16.s27">Sir Percival had gone out a minute before to look at the stables, and no one was in the room but ourselves.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="wwhite.c16.p29"><s sid="71" id="wwhite.c16.s71">My doubts--or to speak more correctly, my convictions--were confirmed by Miss Halcombe's language and manner when I saw her again later in the day.</s> <s sid="72" id="wwhite.c16.s72">She was suspiciously brief and reserved in telling me the result of her interview with her sister.</s> <s sid="73" id="wwhite.c16.s73">Miss Fairlie, it appeared, had listened quietly while the affair of the letter was placed before her in the right point of view, but when Miss Halcombe next proceeded to say that the object of Sir Percival's visit at Limmeridge was to prevail on her to let a day be fixed for the marriage she checked all further reference to the subject by begging for time.</s> <s sid="74" id="wwhite.c16.s74">If Sir Percival would consent to spare her for the present, she would undertake to give him his final answer before the end of the year.</s> <s sid="75" id="wwhite.c16.s75">She pleaded for this delay with such anxiety and agitation, that Miss Halcombe had promised to use her influence, if necessary, to obtain it, and there, at Miss Fairlie's earnest entreaty, all further discussion of the marriage question had ended.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="wwhite.c16.p30"><s sid="76" id="wwhite.c16.s76">The purely temporary arrangement thus proposed might have been convenient enough to the young lady, but it proved somewhat embarrassing to the writer of these lines.</s> <s sid="77" id="wwhite.c16.s77">That morning's post had brought a letter from my partner, which obliged me to return to town the next day by the afternoon train.</s> <s sid="78" id="wwhite.c16.s78">It was extremely probable that I should find no second opportunity of presenting myself at Limmeridge House during the remainder of the year.</s> <s sid="79" id="wwhite.c16.s79">In that case, supposing Miss Fairlie ultimately decided on holding to her engagement, my necessary personal communication with her, before I drew her settlement, would become something like a downright impossibility, and we should be obliged to commit to writing questions which ought always to be discussed on both sides by word of mouth.</s> <s sid="80" id="wwhite.c16.s80">I said nothing about this difficulty until Sir Percival had been consulted on the subject of the desired delay.</s> <s sid="81" id="wwhite.c16.s81">He was too gallant a gentleman not to grant the request immediately.</s> <s sid="82" id="wwhite.c16.s82">When Miss Halcombe informed me of this I told her that I must absolutely speak to her sister before I left Limmeridge, and it was, therefore, arranged that I should see Miss Fairlie in her own sitting-room the next morning.</s> <s sid="83" id="wwhite.c16.s83">She did not come down to dinner, or join us in the evening.</s> <s sid="84" id="wwhite.c16.s84">Indisposition was the excuse, and I thought Sir Percival looked, as well he might, a little annoyed when he heard of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="wwhite.c16.p31"><s sid="85" id="wwhite.c16.s85">The next morning, as soon as breakfast was over, I went up to Miss Fairlie's sitting-room.</s> <s sid="86" id="wwhite.c16.s86">The poor girl looked so pale and sad, and came forward to welcome me so readily and prettily, that the resolution to lecture her on her caprice and indecision, which I had been forming all the way upstairs, failed me on the spot.</s> <s sid="87" id="wwhite.c16.s87">I led her back to the chair from which she had risen, and placed myself opposite to her.</s> <s sid="88" id="wwhite.c16.s88">Her cross-grained pet greyhound was in the room, and I fully expected a barking and snapping reception.</s> <s sid="89" id="wwhite.c16.s89">Strange to say, the whimsical little brute falsified my expectations by jumping into my lap and poking its sharp muzzle familiarly into my hand the moment I sat down.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="wwhite.c16.p35"><s sid="96" id="wwhite.c16.s96">Her fingers had a restless habit, which I remembered in her as a child, of always playing with the first thing that came to hand whenever any one was talking to her.</s> <s sid="97" id="wwhite.c16.s97">On this occasion they wandered to the album, and toyed absently about the margin of the little water-colour drawing.</s> <s sid="98" id="wwhite.c16.s98">The expression of melancholy deepened on her face.</s> <s sid="99" id="wwhite.c16.s99">She did not look at the drawing, or look at me.</s> <s sid="100" id="wwhite.c16.s100">Her eyes moved uneasily from object to object in the room, betraying plainly that she suspected what my purpose was in coming to speak to her.</s> <s sid="101" id="wwhite.c16.s101">Seeing that, I thought it best to get to the purpose with as little delay as possible.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="wwhite.c17.p13"><s sid="35" id="wwhite.c17.s35">So much for the landed property, and for the disposal of the income from it, on the occasion of Miss Fairlie's marriage.</s> <s sid="36" id="wwhite.c17.s36">Thus far, no difficulty or difference of opinion on the lady's settlement was at all likely to arise between Sir Percival's lawyer and myself.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="wwhite.c17.p17"><s sid="52" id="wwhite.c17.s52">Such was the history of the ten thousand pounds.</s> <s sid="53" id="wwhite.c17.s53">Here again no difficulty could arise with Sir Percival's legal adviser.</s> <s sid="54" id="wwhite.c17.s54">The income would be at the wife's disposal, and the principal would go to her aunt or her cousin on her death.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="wwhite.c28.p2"><s sid="2" id="wwhite.c28.s2">For ten minutes or more I sat idle, with the pen in my hand, thinking over the events of the last twelve hours.</s> <s sid="3" id="wwhite.c28.s3">When I at last addressed myself to my task, I found a difficulty in proceeding with it which I had never experienced before.</s> <s sid="4" id="wwhite.c28.s4">In spite of my efforts to fix my thoughts on the matter in hand, they wandered away with the strangest persistency in the one direction of Sir Percival and the Count, and all the interest which I tried to concentrate on my journal centred instead in that private interview between them which had been put off all through the day, and which was now to take place in the silence and solitude of the night.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="wwhite.c28.p3"><s sid="5" id="wwhite.c28.s5">In this perverse state of my mind, the recollection of what had passed since the morning would not come back to me, and there was no resource but to close my journal and to get away from it for a little while.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="wwhite.c28.p4"><s sid="6" id="wwhite.c28.s6">I opened the door which led from my bedroom into my sitting-room, and having passed through, pulled it to again, to prevent any accident in case of draught with the candle left on the dressing- table.</s> <s sid="7" id="wwhite.c28.s7">My sitting-room window was wide open, and I leaned out listlessly to look at the night.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="wwhite.c28.p5"><s sid="8" id="wwhite.c28.s8">It was dark and quiet.</s> <s sid="9" id="wwhite.c28.s9">Neither moon nor stars were visible.</s> <s sid="10" id="wwhite.c28.s10">There was a smell like rain in the still, heavy air, and I put my hand out of window.</s> <s sid="11" id="wwhite.c28.s11">No.  The rain was only threatening, it had not come yet.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="wwhite.c28.p6"><s sid="12" id="wwhite.c28.s12">I remained leaning on the window-sill for nearly a quarter of an hour, looking out absently into the black darkness, and hearing nothing, except now and then the voices of the servants, or the distant sound of a closing door, in the lower part of the house.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="wwhite.c28.p7"><s sid="13" id="wwhite.c28.s13">Just as I was turning away wearily from the window to go back to the bedroom and make a second attempt to complete the unfinished entry in my journal, I smelt the odour of tobacco-smoke stealing towards me on the heavy night air.</s> <s sid="14" id="wwhite.c28.s14">The next moment I saw a tiny red spark advancing from the farther end of the house in the pitch darkness.</s> <s sid="15" id="wwhite.c28.s15">I heard no footsteps, and I could see nothing but the spark.</s> <s sid="16" id="wwhite.c28.s16">It travelled along in the night, passed the window at which I was standing, and stopped opposite my bedroom window, inside which I had left the light burning on the dressing-table.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="wwhite.c28.p8"><s sid="17" id="wwhite.c28.s17">The spark remained stationary for a moment, then moved back again in the direction from which it had advanced.</s> <s sid="18" id="wwhite.c28.s18">As I followed its progress I saw a second red spark, larger than the first, approaching from the distance.</s> <s sid="19" id="wwhite.c28.s19">The two met together in the darkness.</s> <s sid="20" id="wwhite.c28.s20">Remembering who smoked cigarettes and who smoked cigars, I inferred immediately that the Count had come out first to look and listen under my window, and that Sir Percival had afterwards joined him.</s> <s sid="21" id="wwhite.c28.s21">They must both have been walking on the lawn--or I should certainly have heard Sir Percival's heavy footfall, though the Count's soft step might have escaped me, even on the gravel walk.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="wwhite.c28.p9"><s sid="22" id="wwhite.c28.s22">I waited quietly at the window, certain that they could neither of them see me in the darkness of the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="wwhite.c28.p16" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="wwhite.c28.s35"><qs/>"What the devil do you mean?"<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="wwhite.c28.p18"><s sid="37" id="wwhite.c28.s37">They slowly moved away, and the rest of the conversation between them (which had been conducted throughout in the same low tones) ceased to be audible.</s> <s sid="38" id="wwhite.c28.s38">It was no matter.</s> <s sid="39" id="wwhite.c28.s39">I had heard enough to determine me on justifying the Count's opinion of my sharpness and my courage.</s> <s sid="40" id="wwhite.c28.s40">Before the red sparks were out of sight in the darkness I had made up my mind that there should be a listener when those two men sat down to their talk--and that the listener, in spite of all the Count's precautions to the contrary, should be myself.</s> <s sid="41" id="wwhite.c28.s41">I wanted but one motive to sanction the act to my own conscience, and to give me courage enough for performing it--and that motive I had.</s> <s sid="42" id="wwhite.c28.s42">Laura's honour, Laura's happiness--Laura's life itself--might depend on my quick ears and my faithful memory to-night.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="wwhite.c28.p19"><s sid="43" id="wwhite.c28.s43">I had heard the Count say that he meant to examine the rooms on each side of the library, and the staircase as well, before he entered on any explanation with Sir Percival.</s> <s sid="44" id="wwhite.c28.s44">This expression of his intentions was necessarily sufficient to inform me that the library was the room in which he proposed that the conversation should take place.</s> <s sid="45" id="wwhite.c28.s45">The one moment of time which was long enough to bring me to that conclusion was also the moment which showed me a means of baffling his precautions--or, in other words, of hearing what he and Sir Percival said to each other, without the risk of descending at all into the lower regions of the house.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="wwhite.c28.p20"><s sid="46" id="wwhite.c28.s46">In speaking of the rooms on the ground floor I have mentioned incidentally the verandah outside them, on which they all opened by means of French windows, extending from the cornice to the floor.</s> <s sid="47" id="wwhite.c28.s47">The top of this verandah was flat, the rain-water being carried off from it by pipes into tanks which helped to supply the house.</s> <s sid="48" id="wwhite.c28.s48">On the narrow leaden roof, which ran along past the bedrooms, and which was rather less, I should think, than three feet below the sills of the window, a row of flower-pots was ranged, with wide intervals between each pot--the whole being protected from falling in high winds by an ornamental iron railing along the edge of the roof.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="wwhite.c28.p21"><s sid="49" id="wwhite.c28.s49">The plan which had now occurred to me was to get out at my sitting-room window on to this roof, to creep along noiselessly till I reached that part of it which was immediately over the library window, and to crouch down between the flower-pots, with my ear against the outer railing.</s> <s sid="50" id="wwhite.c28.s50">If Sir Percival and the Count sat and smoked to-night, as I had seen them sitting and smoking many nights before, with their chairs close at the open window, and their feet stretched on the zinc garden seats which were placed under the verandah, every word they said to each other above a whisper (and no long conversation, as we all know by experience, can be carried on IN a whisper) must inevitably reach my ears.</s> <s sid="51" id="wwhite.c28.s51">If, on the other hand, they chose to-night to sit far back inside the room, then the chances were that I should hear little or nothing--and in that case, I must run the far more serious risk of trying to outwit them downstairs.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="wwhite.c28.p22"><s sid="52" id="wwhite.c28.s52">Strongly as I was fortified in my resolution by the desperate nature of our situation, I hoped most fervently that I might escape this last emergency.</s> <s sid="53" id="wwhite.c28.s53">My courage was only a woman's courage after all, and it was very near to failing me when I thought of trusting myself on the ground floor, at the dead of night, within reach of Sir Percival and the Count.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="wwhite.c28.p23"><s sid="54" id="wwhite.c28.s54">I went softly back to my bedroom to try the safer experiment of the verandah roof first.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="wwhite.c28.p24"><s sid="55" id="wwhite.c28.s55">A complete change in my dress was imperatively necessary for many reasons.</s> <s sid="56" id="wwhite.c28.s56">I took off my silk gown to begin with, because the slightest noise from it on that still night might have betrayed me.</s> <s sid="57" id="wwhite.c28.s57">I next removed the white and cumbersome parts of my underclothing, and replaced them by a petticoat of dark flannel.</s> <s sid="58" id="wwhite.c28.s58">Over this I put my black travelling cloak, and pulled the hood on to my head.</s> <s sid="59" id="wwhite.c28.s59">In my ordinary evening costume I took up the room of three men at least.</s> <s sid="60" id="wwhite.c28.s60">In my present dress, when it was held close about me, no man could have passed through the narrowest spaces more easily than I.</s> <s sid="61" id="wwhite.c28.s61">The little breadth left on the roof of the verandah, between the flower-pots on one side and the wall and the windows of the house on the other, made this a serious consideration.</s> <s sid="62" id="wwhite.c28.s62">If I knocked anything down, if I made the least noise, who could say what the consequences might be?</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="wwhite.c28.p25"><s sid="63" id="wwhite.c28.s63">I only waited to put the matches near the candle before I extinguished it, and groped my way back into the sitting-room, I locked that door, as I had locked my bedroom door--then quietly got out of the window, and cautiously set my feet on the leaden roof of the verandah.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="wwhite.c28.p26"><s sid="64" id="wwhite.c28.s64">My two rooms were at the inner extremity of the new wing of the house in which we all lived, and I had five windows to pass before I could reach the position it was necessary to take up immediately over the library.</s> <s sid="65" id="wwhite.c28.s65">The first window belonged to a spare room which was empty.</s> <s sid="66" id="wwhite.c28.s66">The second and third windows belonged to Laura's room.</s> <s sid="67" id="wwhite.c28.s67">The fourth window belonged to Sir Percival's room.</s> <s sid="68" id="wwhite.c28.s68">The fifth belonged to the Countess's room.</s> <s sid="69" id="wwhite.c28.s69">The others, by which it was not necessary for me to pass, were the windows of the Count's dressing-room, of the bath-room, and of the second empty spare room.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="wwhite.c28.p27"><s sid="70" id="wwhite.c28.s70">No sound reached my ears--the black blinding darkness of the night was all round me when I first stood on the verandah, except at that part of it which Madame Fosco's window over-looked.</s> <s sid="71" id="wwhite.c28.s71">There, at the very place above the library to which my course was directed--there I saw a gleam of light!</s> <s sid="72" id="wwhite.c28.s72">The Countess was not yet in bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="wwhite.c28.p28" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="wwhite.c28.s73">It was too late to draw back--it was no time to wait.</s> <s sid="74" id="wwhite.c28.s74">I determined to go on at all hazards, and trust for security to my own caution and to the darkness of the night.</s> <s sid="75" id="wwhite.c28.s75"><qs/>"For Laura's sake!"<qe/></s> <s sid="76" id="wwhite.c28.s76">I thought to myself, as I took the first step forward on the roof, with one hand holding my cloak close round me, and the other groping against the wall of the house.</s> <s sid="77" id="wwhite.c28.s77">It was better to brush close by the wall than to risk striking my feet against the flower-pots within a few inches of me, on the other side.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="wwhite.c28.p29" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="wwhite.c28.s78">I passed the dark window of the spare room, trying the leaden roof at each step with my foot before I risked resting my weight on it.</s> <s sid="79" id="wwhite.c28.s79">I passed the dark windows of Laura's room (<qs/>"God bless her and keep her to-night!"<qe/>).</s> <s sid="80" id="wwhite.c28.s80">I passed the dark window of Sir Percival's room.</s> <s sid="81" id="wwhite.c28.s81">Then I waited a moment, knelt down with my hands to support me, and so crept to my position, under the protection of the low wall between the bottom of the lighted window and the verandah roof.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="wwhite.c28.p30"><s sid="82" id="wwhite.c28.s82">When I ventured to look up at the window itself I found that the top of it only was open, and that the blind inside was drawn down.</s> <s sid="83" id="wwhite.c28.s83">While I was looking I saw the shadow of Madame Fosco pass across the white field of the blind--then pass slowly back again.</s> <s sid="84" id="wwhite.c28.s84">Thus far she could not have heard me, or the shadow would surely have stopped at the blind, even if she had wanted courage enough to open the window and look out?</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="wwhite.c28.p31"><s sid="85" id="wwhite.c28.s85">I placed myself sideways against the railing of the verandah-- first ascertaining, by touching them, the position of the flower- pots on either side of me.</s> <s sid="86" id="wwhite.c28.s86">There was room enough for me to sit between them and no more.</s> <s sid="87" id="wwhite.c28.s87">The sweet-scented leaves of the flower on my left hand just brushed my cheek as I lightly rested my head against the railing.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="wwhite.c28.p32"><s sid="88" id="wwhite.c28.s88">The first sounds that reached me from below were caused by the opening or closing (most probably the latter) of three doors in succession--the doors, no doubt, leading into the hall and into the rooms on each side of the library, which the Count had pledged himself to examine.</s> <s sid="89" id="wwhite.c28.s89">The first object that I saw was the red spark again travelling out into the night from under the verandah, moving away towards my window, waiting a moment, and then returning to the place from which it had set out.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="wwhite.c28.p35"><s sid="93" id="wwhite.c28.s93">His exclamation was followed by the scraping of the garden chairs on the tiled pavement under the verandah--the welcome sound which told me they were going to sit close at the window as usual.</s> <s sid="94" id="wwhite.c28.s94">So far the chance was mine.</s> <s sid="95" id="wwhite.c28.s95">The clock in the turret struck the quarter to twelve as they settled themselves in their chairs.</s> <s sid="96" id="wwhite.c28.s96">I heard Madame Fosco through the open window yawning, and saw her shadow pass once more across the white field of the blind.</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="wwhite.c33.p65"><s sid="215" id="wwhite.c33.s215">Miss Halcombe left the room--waited till the first heat of her indignation had passed away--decided on reflection that Mr. Fairlie should see his niece in the interests of common humanity before he closed his doors on her as a stranger--and thereupon, without a word of previous warning, took Lady Glyde with her to his room.</s> <s sid="216" id="wwhite.c33.s216">The servant was posted at the door to prevent their entrance, but Miss Halcombe insisted on passing him, and made her way into Mr. Fairlie's presence, leading her sister by the hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="wwhite.c37.p3"><s sid="7" id="wwhite.c37.s7">It was impossible for me to tell her the whole truth without, at the same time, entering into particulars on the subject of the conspiracy, which it would have been dangerous to confide to a stranger.</s> <s sid="8" id="wwhite.c37.s8">I could only abstain most carefully from raising any false hopes, and then explain that the object of my visit was to discover the persons who were really responsible for Anne's disappearance.</s> <s sid="9" id="wwhite.c37.s9">I even added, so as to exonerate myself from any after-reproach of my own conscience, that I entertained not the least hope of being able to trace her--that I believed we should never see her alive again--and that my main interest in the affair was to bring to punishment two men whom I suspected to be concerned in luring her away, and at whose hands I and some dear friends of mine had suffered a grievous wrong.</s> <s sid="10" id="wwhite.c37.s10">With this explanation I left it to Mrs. Clements to say whether our interest in the matter (whatever difference there might be in the motives which actuated us) was not the same, and whether she felt any reluctance to forward my object by giving me such information on the subject of my inquiries as she happened to possess.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="wwhite.c37.p5"><s sid="13" id="wwhite.c37.s13">Knowing by experience that the plainest narrative attainable from persons who are not accustomed to arrange their ideas, is the narrative which goes far enough back at the beginning to avoid all impediments of retrospection in its course, I asked Mrs. Clements to tell me first what had happened after she had left Limmeridge, and so, by watchful questioning, carried her on from point to point, till we reached the period of Anne's disappearance.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="wwhite.c37.p6"><s sid="14" id="wwhite.c37.s14">The substance of the information which I thus obtained was as follows:--</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="wwhite.c37.p7"><s sid="15" id="wwhite.c37.s15">On leaving the farm at Todd's Corner, Mrs. Clements and Anne had travelled that day as far as Derby, and had remained there a week on Anne's account.</s> <s sid="16" id="wwhite.c37.s16">They had then gone on to London, and had lived in the lodging occupied by Mrs. Clements at that time for a month or more, when circumstances connected with the house and the landlord had obliged them to change their quarters.</s> <s sid="17" id="wwhite.c37.s17">Anne's terror of being discovered in London or its neighbourhood, whenever they ventured to walk out, had gradually communicated itself to Mrs. Clements, and she had determined on removing to one of the most out-of-the-way places in England--to the town of Grimsby in Lincolnshire, where her deceased husband had passed all his early life.</s> <s sid="18" id="wwhite.c37.s18">His relatives were respectable people settled in the town-- they had always treated Mrs. Clements with great kindness, and she thought it impossible to do better than go there and take the advice of her husband's friends.</s> <s sid="19" id="wwhite.c37.s19">Anne would not hear of returning to her mother at Welmingham, because she had been removed to the Asylum from that place, and because Sir Percival would be certain to go back there and find her again.</s> <s sid="20" id="wwhite.c37.s20">There was serious weight in this objection, and Mrs. Clements felt that it was not to be easily removed.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="wwhite.c37.p8"><s sid="21" id="wwhite.c37.s21">At Grimsby the first serious symptoms of illness had shown themselves in Anne.</s> <s sid="22" id="wwhite.c37.s22">They appeared soon after the news of Lady Glyde's marriage had been made public in the newspapers, and had reached her through that medium.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="wwhite.c37.p9"><s sid="23" id="wwhite.c37.s23">The medical man who was sent for to attend the sick woman discovered at once that she was suffering from a serious affection of the heart.</s> <s sid="24" id="wwhite.c37.s24">The illness lasted long, left her very weak, and returned at intervals, though with mitigated severity, again and again.</s> <s sid="25" id="wwhite.c37.s25">They remained at Grimsby, in consequence, during the first half of the new year, and there they might probably have stayed much longer, but for the sudden resolution which Anne took at this time to venture back to Hampshire, for the purpose of obtaining a private interview with Lady Glyde.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="wwhite.c37.p10"><s sid="26" id="wwhite.c37.s26">Mrs. Clements did all in her power to oppose the execution of this hazardous and unaccountable project.</s> <s sid="27" id="wwhite.c37.s27">No explanation of her motives was offered by Anne, except that she believed the day of her death was not far off, and that she had something on her mind which must be communicated to Lady Glyde, at any risk, in secret.</s> <s sid="28" id="wwhite.c37.s28">Her resolution to accomplish this purpose was so firmly settled that she declared her intention of going to Hampshire by herself if Mrs. Clements felt any unwillingness to go with her.</s> <s sid="29" id="wwhite.c37.s29">The doctor, on being consulted, was of opinion that serious opposition to her wishes would, in all probability, produce another and perhaps a fatal fit of illness, and Mrs. Clements, under this advice, yielded to necessity, and once more, with sad forebodings of trouble and danger to come, allowed Anne Catherick to have her own way.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="wwhite.c37.p11"><s sid="30" id="wwhite.c37.s30">On the journey from London to Hampshire Mrs. Clements discovered that one of their fellow-passengers was well acquainted with the neighbourhood of Blackwater, and could give her all the information she needed on the subject of localities.</s> <s sid="31" id="wwhite.c37.s31">In this way she found out that the only place they could go to, which was not dangerously near to Sir Percival's residence, was a large village called Sandon.</s> <s sid="32" id="wwhite.c37.s32">The distance here from Blackwater Park was between three and four miles--and that distance, and back again, Anne had walked on each occasion when she had appeared in the neighbourhood of the lake.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="wwhite.c37.p12"><s sid="33" id="wwhite.c37.s33">For the few days during which they were at Sandon without being discovered they had lived a little away from the village, in the cottage of a decent widow-woman who had a bedroom to let, and whose discreet silence Mrs. Clements had done her best to secure, for the first week at least.</s> <s sid="34" id="wwhite.c37.s34">She had also tried hard to induce Anne to be content with writing to Lady Glyde, in the first instance; but the failure of the warning contained in the anonymous letter sent to Limmeridge had made Anne resolute to speak this time, and obstinate in the determination to go on her errand alone.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="wwhite.c37.p13"><s sid="35" id="wwhite.c37.s35">Mrs. Clements, nevertheless, followed her privately on each occasion when she went to the lake, without, however, venturing near enough to the boat-house to be witness of what took place there.</s> <s sid="36" id="wwhite.c37.s36">When Anne returned for the last time from the dangerous neighbourhood, the fatigue of walking, day after day, distances which were far too great for her strength, added to the exhausting effect of the agitation from which she had suffered, produced the result which Mrs. Clements had dreaded all along.</s> <s sid="37" id="wwhite.c37.s37">The old pain over the heart and the other symptoms of the illness at Grimsby returned, and Anne was confined to her bed in the cottage.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="wwhite.c37.p14"><s sid="38" id="wwhite.c37.s38">In this emergency the first necessity, as Mrs. Clements knew by experience, was to endeavour to quiet Anne's anxiety of mind, and for this purpose the good woman went herself the next day to the lake, to try if she could find Lady Glyde (who would be sure, as Anne said, to take her daily walk to the boat-house), and prevail on her to come back privately to the cottage near Sandon.</s> <s sid="39" id="wwhite.c37.s39">On reaching the outskirts of the plantation Mrs. Clements encountered, not Lady Glyde, but a tall, stout, elderly gentleman, with a book in his hand--in other words, Count Fosco.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="wwhite.c37.p15"><s sid="40" id="wwhite.c37.s40">The Count, after looking at her very attentively for a moment, asked if she expected to see any one in that place, and added, before she could reply, that he was waiting there with a message from Lady Glyde, but that he was not quite certain whether the person then before him answered the description of the person with whom he was desired to communicate.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="wwhite.c37.p16"><s sid="41" id="wwhite.c37.s41">Upon this Mrs. Clements at once confided her errand to him, and entreated that he would help to allay Anne's anxiety by trusting his message to her.</s> <s sid="42" id="wwhite.c37.s42">The Count most readily and kindly complied with her request.</s> <s sid="43" id="wwhite.c37.s43">The message, he said, was a very important one.</s> <s sid="44" id="wwhite.c37.s44">Lady Glyde entreated Anne and her good friend to return immediately to London, as she felt certain that Sir Percival would discover them if they remained any longer in the neighbourhood of Blackwater.</s> <s sid="45" id="wwhite.c37.s45">She was herself going to London in a short time, and if Mrs. Clements and Anne would go there first, and would let her know what their address was, they should hear from her and see her in a fortnight or less.</s> <s sid="46" id="wwhite.c37.s46">The Count added that he had already attempted to give a friendly warning to Anne herself, but that she had been too much startled by seeing that he was a stranger to let him approach and speak to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="wwhite.c37.p20"><s sid="60" id="wwhite.c37.s60">This medicine had an extraordinary effect on Anne, and the good results of it were helped by the assurance Mrs. Clements could now give her that she would soon see Lady Glyde in London.</s> <s sid="61" id="wwhite.c37.s61">At the appointed day and time (when they had not been quite so long as a week in Hampshire altogether), they arrived at the station.</s> <s sid="62" id="wwhite.c37.s62">The Count was waiting there for them, and was talking to an elderly lady, who appeared to be going to travel by the train to London also.</s> <s sid="63" id="wwhite.c37.s63">He most kindly assisted them, and put them into the carriage himself, begging Mrs. Clements not to forget to send her address to Lady Glyde.</s> <s sid="64" id="wwhite.c37.s64">The elderly lady did not travel in the same compartment, and they did not notice what became of her on reaching the London terminus.</s> <s sid="65" id="wwhite.c37.s65">Mrs. Clements secured respectable lodgings in a quiet neighbourhood, and then wrote, as she had engaged to do, to inform Lady Glyde of the address.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="wwhite.c38.p2"><s sid="2" id="wwhite.c38.s2">It was clear that the series of deceptions which had removed Anne Catherick to London, and separated her from Mrs. Clements, had been accomplished solely by Count Fosco and the Countess, and the question whether any part of the conduct of husband or wife had been of a kind to place either of them within reach of the law might be well worthy of future consideration.</s> <s sid="3" id="wwhite.c38.s3">But the purpose I had now in view led me in another direction than this.</s> <s sid="4" id="wwhite.c38.s4">The immediate object of my visit to Mrs. Clements was to make some approach at least to the discovery of Sir Percival's secret, and she had said nothing as yet which advanced me on my way to that important end.</s> <s sid="5" id="wwhite.c38.s5">I felt the necessity of trying to awaken her recollections of other times, persons, and events than those on which her memory had hitherto been employed, and when I next spoke I spoke with that object indirectly in view.</s> </p>
