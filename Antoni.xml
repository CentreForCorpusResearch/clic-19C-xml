<stru>ANTONINA

OR, THE FALL OF ROME



by WILKIE COLLINS</stru>









<stru>PREFACE



In preparing to compose a fiction founded on history, the writer of

these pages thought it no necessary requisite of such a work that the

principal characters appearing in it should be drawn from the historical

personages of the period.  On the contrary, he felt that some very

weighty objections attached to this plan of composition.  He knew well

that it obliged a writer to add largely from invention to what was

actually known--to fill in with the colouring of romantic fancy the bare

outline of historic fact--and thus to place the novelist's fiction in

what he could not but consider most unfavourable contrast to the

historian's truth.  He was further by no means convinced that any story

in which historical characters supplied the main agents, could be

preserved in its fit unity of design and restrained within its due

limits of development, without some falsification or confusion of

historical dates--a species of poetical licence of which he felt no

disposition to avail himself, as it was his main anxiety to make his

plot invariably arise and proceed out of the great events of the era

exactly in the order in which they occurred.



Influenced, therefore, by these considerations, he thought that by

forming all his principal characters from imagination, he should be able

to mould them as he pleased to the main necessities of the story; to

display them, without any impropriety, as influenced in whatever manner

appeared most strikingly interesting by its minor incidents; and

further, to make them, on all occasions, without trammel or hindrance,

the practical exponents of the spirit of the age, of all the various

historical illustrations of the period, which the Author's researches

among conflicting but equally important authorities had enabled him to

garner up, while, at the same time, the appearance of verisimilitude

necessary to an historical romance might, he imagined, be successfully

preserved by the occasional introduction of the living characters of the

era, in those portions of the plot comprising events with which they had

been remarkably connected.



On this plan the recent work has been produced.





To the fictitious characters alone is committed the task of representing

the spirit of the age. The Roman emperor, Honorius, and the Gothic king,

Alaric, mix but little personally in the business of the story--only

appearing in such events, and acting under such circumstances, as the

records of history strictly authorise; but exact truth in respect to

time, place, and circumstance is observed in every historical event

introduced in the plot, from the period of the march of the Gothic

invaders over the Alps to the close of the first barbarian blockade of

Rome.</stru>

<title>CHAPTER 1.  GOISVINTHA.</title>

<p pid="1" id="Antoni.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="Antoni.c1.s1">The mountains forming the range of Alps which border on the north- eastern confines of Italy, were, in the autumn of the year 408, already furrowed in numerous directions by the tracks of the invading forces of those northern nations generally comprised under the appellation of Goths.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Antoni.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="Antoni.c1.s2">In some places these tracks were denoted on either side by fallen trees, and occasionally assumed, when half obliterated by the ravages of storms, the appearance of desolate and irregular marshes.</s> <s sid="3" id="Antoni.c1.s3">In other places they were less palpable.</s> <s sid="4" id="Antoni.c1.s4">Here, the temporary path was entirely hidden by the incursions of a swollen torrent; there, it was faintly perceptible in occasional patches of soft ground, or partly traceable by fragments of abandoned armour, skeletons of horses and men, and remnants of the rude bridges which had once served for passage across a river or transit over a precipice.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Antoni.c1.p3"><s sid="5" id="Antoni.c1.s5">Among the rocks of the topmost of the range of mountains immediately overhanging the plains of Italy, and presenting the last barrier to the exertions of a traveller or the march of an invader, there lay, at the beginning of the fifth century, a little lake.</s> <s sid="6" id="Antoni.c1.s6">Bounded on three sides by precipices, its narrow banks barren of verdure or habitations, and its dark and stagnant waters brightened but rarely by the presence of the lively sunlight, this solitary spot--at all times mournful-- presented, on the autumn of the day when our story commences, an aspect of desolation at once dismal to the eye and oppressive to the heart.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Antoni.c1.p4"><s sid="7" id="Antoni.c1.s7">It was near noon; but no sun appeared in the heaven.</s> <s sid="8" id="Antoni.c1.s8">The dull clouds, monotonous in colour and form, hid all beauty in the firmament, and shed heavy darkness on the earth.</s> <s sid="9" id="Antoni.c1.s9">Dense, stagnant vapours clung to the mountain summits; from the drooping trees dead leaves and rotten branches sunk, at intervals, on the oozy soil, or whirled over the gloomy precipice; and a small steady rain fell, slow and unintermitting, upon the deserts around.</s> <s sid="10" id="Antoni.c1.s10">Standing upon the path which armies had once trodden, and which armies were still destined to tread, and looking towards the solitary lake, you heard, at first, no sound but the regular dripping of the rain-drops from rock to rock; you saw no prospect but the motionless waters at your feet, and the dusky crags which shadowed them from above.</s> <s sid="11" id="Antoni.c1.s11">When, however, impressed by the mysterious loneliness of the place, the eye grew more penetrating and the ear more attentive, a cavern became apparent in the precipices round the lake; and, in the intervals of the heavy rain-drops, were faintly perceptible the sounds of a human voice.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Antoni.c1.p5"><s sid="12" id="Antoni.c1.s12">The mouth of the cavern was partly concealed by a large stone, on which were piled some masses of rotten brushwood, as if for the purpose of protecting any inhabitant it might contain from the coldness of the atmosphere without.</s> <s sid="13" id="Antoni.c1.s13">Placed at the eastward boundary of the lake, this strange place of refuge commanded a view not only of the rugged path immediately below it, but of a large plot of level ground at a short distance to the west, which overhung a second and lower range of rocks.</s> <s sid="14" id="Antoni.c1.s14">From this spot might be seen far beneath, on days when the atmosphere was clear, the olive grounds that clothed the mountain's base, and beyond, stretching away to the distant horizon, the plains of fated Italy, whose destiny of defeat and shame was now hastening to its dark and fearful accomplishment.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Antoni.c1.p6"><s sid="15" id="Antoni.c1.s15">The cavern, within, was low and irregular in form.</s> <s sid="16" id="Antoni.c1.s16">From its rugged walls the damp oozed forth upon its floor of decayed moss.</s> <s sid="17" id="Antoni.c1.s17">Lizards and noisome animals had tenanted its comfortless recesses undisturbed, until the period we have just described, when their miserable rights were infringed on for the first time by human intruders.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Antoni.c1.p7"><s sid="18" id="Antoni.c1.s18">A woman crouched near the entrance of the place.</s> <s sid="19" id="Antoni.c1.s19">More within, on the driest part of the ground, lay a child asleep.</s> <s sid="20" id="Antoni.c1.s20">Between them were scattered some withered branches and decayed leaves, which were arranged as if to form a fire.</s> <s sid="21" id="Antoni.c1.s21">In many parts this scanty collection of fuel was slightly blackened; but, wetted as it was by the rain, all efforts to light it permanently had evidently been fruitless.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Antoni.c1.p8"><s sid="22" id="Antoni.c1.s22">The woman's head was bent forwards, and her face, hid in her hands, rested on her knees.</s> <s sid="23" id="Antoni.c1.s23">At intervals she muttered to herself in a hoarse, moaning voice.</s> <s sid="24" id="Antoni.c1.s24">A portion of her scanty clothing had been removed to cover the child.</s> <s sid="25" id="Antoni.c1.s25">What remained on her was composed, partly of skins of animals, partly of coarse cotton cloth.</s> <s sid="26" id="Antoni.c1.s26">In many places this miserable dress was marked with blood, and her long, flaxen hair bore upon its dishevelled locks the same ominous and repulsive stain.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Antoni.c1.p9"><s sid="27" id="Antoni.c1.s27">The child seemed scarcely four years of age, and showed on his pale, thin face all the peculiarities of his Gothic origin.</s> <s sid="28" id="Antoni.c1.s28">His features seemed to have been once beautiful, both in expression and form; but a deep wound, extending the whole length of his cheek, had now deformed him for ever.</s> <s sid="29" id="Antoni.c1.s29">He shivered and trembled in his sleep, and every now and then mechanically stretched forth his little arms towards the dead cold branches that were scattered before him.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Antoni.c1.p10"><s sid="30" id="Antoni.c1.s30">Suddenly a large stone became detached from the rock in a distant part of the cavern, and fell noisily to the ground.</s> <s sid="31" id="Antoni.c1.s31">At this sound he woke with a scream--raised himself--endeavoured to advance towards the woman, and staggered backward against the side of the cave.</s> <s sid="32" id="Antoni.c1.s32">A second wound in the leg had wreaked that destruction on his vigour which the first had effected on his beauty.</s> <s sid="33" id="Antoni.c1.s33">He was a cripple.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Antoni.c1.p11"><s sid="34" id="Antoni.c1.s34">At the instant of his awakening the woman had started up.</s> <s sid="35" id="Antoni.c1.s35">She now raised him from the ground, and taking some herbs from her bosom, applied them to his wounded cheek.</s> <s sid="36" id="Antoni.c1.s36">By this action her dress became discomposed:  it was stiff at the top with coagulated blood, which had evidently flowed from a cut in her neck.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Antoni.c1.p12"><s sid="37" id="Antoni.c1.s37">All her attempts to compose the child were in vain; he moaned and wept piteously, muttering at intervals his disjointed exclamations of impatience at the coldness of the place and the agony of his recent wounds.</s> <s sid="38" id="Antoni.c1.s38">Speechless and tearless the wretched woman looked vacantly down on his face.</s> <s sid="39" id="Antoni.c1.s39">There was little difficulty in discerning from that fixed, distracted gaze the nature of the tie that bound the mourning woman to the suffering boy.</s> <s sid="40" id="Antoni.c1.s40">The expression of rigid and awful despair that lowered in her fixed, gloomy eyes, the livid paleness that discoloured her compressed lips, the spasms that shook her firm, commanding form, mutely expressing in the divine eloquence of human emotion that between the solitary pair there existed the most intimate of earth's relationships--the connection of mother and child.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="Antoni.c1.p13"><s sid="41" id="Antoni.c1.s41">For some time no change occurred in the woman's demeanour.</s> <s sid="42" id="Antoni.c1.s42">At last, as if struck by some sudden suspicion, she rose, and clasping the child in one arm, displaced with the other the brushwood at the entrance of her place of refuge, cautiously looking forth on all that the mists left visible of the western landscape.</s> <s sid="43" id="Antoni.c1.s43">After a short survey she drew back as if reassured by the unbroken solitude of the place, and turning towards the lake, looked down upon the black waters at her feet.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Antoni.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="Antoni.c1.s44"><qs/>'Night has succeeded to night,'<qe/><sss/> she muttered gloomily, <sse/><qs/>'and has brought no succour to my body, and no hope to my heart!</s> <s sid="45" id="Antoni.c1.s45">Mile on mile have I journeyed, and danger is still behind, and loneliness for ever before.</s> <s sid="46" id="Antoni.c1.s46">The shadow of death deepens over the boy; the burden of anguish grows weightier than I can bear.</s> <s sid="47" id="Antoni.c1.s47">For me, friends are murdered, defenders are distant, possessions are lost.</s> <s sid="48" id="Antoni.c1.s48">The God of the Christian priests has abandoned us to danger and deserted us in woe.</s> <s sid="49" id="Antoni.c1.s49">It is for me to end the struggle for us both.</s> <s sid="50" id="Antoni.c1.s50">Our last refuge has been in this place--our sepulchre shall be here as well!'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Antoni.c1.p15"><s sid="51" id="Antoni.c1.s51">With one last look at the cold and comfortless sky, she advanced to the very edge of the lake's precipitous bank.</s> <s sid="52" id="Antoni.c1.s52">Already the child was raised in her arms, and her body bent to accomplish successfully the fatal spring, when a sound in the east--faint, distant, and fugitive--caught her ear.</s> <s sid="53" id="Antoni.c1.s53">In an instant her eye brightened, her chest heaved, her cheek flushed.</s> <s sid="54" id="Antoni.c1.s54">She exerted the last relics of her wasted strength to gain a prominent position upon a ledge of the rocks behind her, and waited in an agony of expectation for a repetition of that magic sound.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Antoni.c1.p16"><s sid="55" id="Antoni.c1.s55">In a moment more she heard it again--for the child, stupefied with terror at the action that had accompanied her determination to plunge with him into the lake, now kept silence, and she could listen undisturbed.</s> <s sid="56" id="Antoni.c1.s56">To unpractised ears the sound that so entranced her would have been scarcely audible.</s> <s sid="57" id="Antoni.c1.s57">Even the experienced traveller would have thought it nothing more than the echo of a fallen stone among the rocks in the eastward distance.</s> <s sid="58" id="Antoni.c1.s58">But to her it was no unimportant sound, for it gave the welcome signal of deliverance and delight.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Antoni.c1.p17"><s sid="59" id="Antoni.c1.s59">As the hour wore on, it came nearer and nearer, tossed about by the sportive echoes, and now clearly betraying that its origin was, as she had at first divined, the note of the Gothic trumpet.</s> <s sid="60" id="Antoni.c1.s60">Soon the distant music ceased, and was succeeded by another sound, low and rumbling, as of an earthquake afar off or a rising thunderstorm, and changing, ere long, to a harsh confused noise, like the rustling of a mighty wind through whole forests of brushwood.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="Antoni.c1.p18"><s sid="61" id="Antoni.c1.s61">At this instant the woman lost all command over herself; her former patience and caution deserted her; reckless of danger, she placed the child upon the ledge on which she had been standing; and, though trembling in every limb, succeeded in mounting so much higher on the crag as to gain a fissure near the top of the rock, which commanded an uninterrupted view of the vast tracts of uneven ground leading in an easterly direction to the next range of precipices and ravines.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="Antoni.c1.p19"><s sid="62" id="Antoni.c1.s62">One after another the long minutes glided on, and, though much was still audible, nothing was yet to be seen.</s> <s sid="63" id="Antoni.c1.s63">At length the shrill sound of the trumpet again rang through the dull, misty air, and the next instant the advance guard of an army of Goths emerged from the distant woods.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="Antoni.c1.p20"><s sid="64" id="Antoni.c1.s64">Then, after an interval, the multitudes of the main body thronged through every outlet in the trees, and spread in dusky masses over the desert ground that lay between the woods and the rocks about the borders of the lake.</s> <s sid="65" id="Antoni.c1.s65">The front ranks halted, as if to communicate with the crowds of the rearguard and the stragglers among the baggage waggons, who still poured forth, apparently in interminable hosts, from the concealment of the distant trees.</s> <s sid="66" id="Antoni.c1.s66">The advanced troops, evidently with the intention of examining the roads, still marched rapidly on, until they gained the foot of the ascent leading to the crags to which the woman still clung, and from which, with eager attention, she still watched their movements.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="Antoni.c1.p21"><s sid="67" id="Antoni.c1.s67">Placed in a situation of the extremest peril, her strength was her only preservative against the danger of slipping from her high and narrow elevation.</s> <s sid="68" id="Antoni.c1.s68">Hitherto the moral excitement of expectation had given her the physical power necessary to maintain her position; but just as the leaders of the guard arrived at the cavern, her over-wrought energies suddenly deserted her; her hands relaxed their grasp; she tottered, and would have sunk backwards to instant destruction, had not the skins wrapped about her bosom and waist become entangled with a point of one of the jagged rocks immediately around her.</s> <s sid="69" id="Antoni.c1.s69">Fortunately--for she could utter no cry--the troops halted at this instant to enable their horses to gain breath.</s> <s sid="70" id="Antoni.c1.s70">Two among them at once perceived her position and detected her nation.</s> <s sid="71" id="Antoni.c1.s71">They mounted the rocks; and, while one possessed himself of the child, the other succeeded in rescuing the mother and bearing her safely to the ground.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="Antoni.c1.p22"><s sid="72" id="Antoni.c1.s72">The snorting of horses, the clashing of weapons, the confusion of loud, rough voices, which now startled the native silence of the solitary lake, and which would have bewildered and overwhelmed most persons in the woman's exhausted condition, seemed, on the contrary, to reassure her feelings and reanimate her powers.</s> <s sid="73" id="Antoni.c1.s73">She disengaged herself from her preserver's support, and taking her child in her arms, advanced towards a man of gigantic stature, whose rich armour sufficiently announced that his position in the army was one of command.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="Antoni.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="Antoni.c1.s74"><qs/>'I am Goisvintha,'<qe/><sls/> said she, in a firm, calm voice--<sle/><qs/>'sister to Hermanric.</s> <s sid="75" id="Antoni.c1.s75">I have escaped from the massacre of the hostages of Aquileia with one child.</s> <s sid="76" id="Antoni.c1.s76">Is my brother with the army of the king?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="Antoni.c1.p24"><s sid="77" id="Antoni.c1.s77">This declaration produced a marked change in the bystanders.</s> <s sid="78" id="Antoni.c1.s78">The looks of indifference or curiosity which they had at first cast on the fugitive, changed to the liveliest expression of wonder and respect.</s> <s sid="79" id="Antoni.c1.s79">The chieftain whom she had addressed raised the visor of his helmet so as to uncover his face, answered her question in the affirmative, and ordered two soldiers to conduct her to the temporary encampment of the main army in the rear.</s> <s sid="80" id="Antoni.c1.s80">As she turned to depart, an old man advanced, leaning on his long, heavy sword, and accosted her thus--</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="Antoni.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="Antoni.c1.s81"><qs/>'I am Withimer, whose daughter was left hostage with the Romans in Aquileia.</s> <s sid="82" id="Antoni.c1.s82">Is she of the slain or of the escaped?'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="Antoni.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="Antoni.c1.s83"><qs/>'Her bones rot under the city walls,'<qe/> was the answer.</s> <s sid="84" id="Antoni.c1.s84"><qs/>'The Romans made of her a feast for the dogs.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="Antoni.c1.p27"><s sid="85" id="Antoni.c1.s85">No word or tear escaped the old warrior.</s> <s sid="86" id="Antoni.c1.s86">He turned in the direction of Italy; but, as he looked downwards towards the plains, his brow lowered, and his hands tightened mechanically round the hilt of his enormous weapon.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="Antoni.c1.p28"><s sid="87" id="Antoni.c1.s87">The same gloomy question was propounded to Goisvintha by the two men who guided her to the army that had been asked by their aged comrade.</s> <s sid="88" id="Antoni.c1.s88">It received the same terrible answer, which was borne with the same stern composure, and followed by the same ominous glance in the direction of Italy, as in the instance of the veteran Withimer.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="Antoni.c1.p29"><s sid="89" id="Antoni.c1.s89">Leading the horse that carried the exhausted woman with the utmost care, and yet with wonderful rapidity, down the paths which they had so recently ascended, the men in a short space of time reached the place where the army had halted, and displayed to Goisvintha, in all the majesty of numbers and repose, the vast martial assemblage of the warriors of the North.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="Antoni.c1.p30"><s sid="90" id="Antoni.c1.s90">No brightness gleamed from their armour; no banners waved over their heads; no music sounded among their ranks.</s> <s sid="91" id="Antoni.c1.s91">Backed by the dreary woods, which still disgorged unceasing additions to the warlike multitude already encamped; surrounded by the desolate crags which showed dim, wild, and majestic through the darkness of the mist; covered with the dusky clouds which hovered motionless over the barren mountain tops, and poured their stormy waters on the uncultivated plains--all that the appearance of the Goths had of solemnity in itself was in awful harmony with the cold and mournful aspect that the face of Nature had assumed.</s> <s sid="92" id="Antoni.c1.s92">Silent--menacing--dark,--the army looked the fit embodiment of its leader's tremendous purpose--the subjugation of Rome.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="Antoni.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="Antoni.c1.s93">Conducting Goisvintha quickly through the front files of warriors, her guides, pausing at a spot of ground which shelved upwards at right angles with the main road from the woods, desired her to dismount; and pointing to the group that occupied the place, said, <qs/>'Yonder is Alaric the king, and with him is Hermanric thy brother.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="Antoni.c1.p32"><s sid="94" id="Antoni.c1.s94">At whatever point of view it could have been regarded, the assemblage of persons thus indicated to Goisvintha must have arrested inattention itself.</s> <s sid="95" id="Antoni.c1.s95">Near a confused mass of weapons, scattered on the ground, reclined a group of warriors apparently listening to the low, muttered conversation of three men of great age, who rose above them, seated on pieces of rock, and whose long white hair, rough skin dresses, and lean tottering forms appeared in strong contrast with the iron-clad and gigantic figures of their auditors beneath.</s> <s sid="96" id="Antoni.c1.s96">Above the old men, on the highroad, was one of Alaric's waggons; and on the heaps of baggage piled against its clumsy wheels had been chosen resting-place of the future conqueror of Rome.</s> <s sid="97" id="Antoni.c1.s97">The top of the vehicle seemed absolutely teeming with a living burden.</s> <s sid="98" id="Antoni.c1.s98">Perched in every available nook and corner were women and children of all ages, and weapons and live stock of all varieties.</s> <s sid="99" id="Antoni.c1.s99">Now, a child--lively, mischievous, inquisitive--peered forth over the head of a battering-ram.</s> <s sid="100" id="Antoni.c1.s100">Now, a lean, hungry sheep advanced his inquiring nostrils sadly to the open air, and displayed by the movement the head of a withered old woman pillowed on his woolly flanks.</s> <s sid="101" id="Antoni.c1.s101">Here, appeared a young girl struggling, half entombed in shields.</s> <s sid="102" id="Antoni.c1.s102">There, gasped an emaciated camp-follower, nearly suffocated in heaps of furs.</s> <s sid="103" id="Antoni.c1.s103">The whole scene, with its background of great woods, drenched in a vapour of misty rain, with its striking contrasts at one point and its solemn harmonies at another, presented a vast combination of objects that either startled or awed--a gloomy conjunction of the menacing and the sublime.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="Antoni.c1.p33"><s sid="104" id="Antoni.c1.s104">Bidding Goisvintha wait near the waggon, one of her conductors approached and motioned aside a young man standing near the king.</s> <s sid="105" id="Antoni.c1.s105">As the warrior rose to obey the demand, he displayed, with all the physical advantages of his race, and ease and elasticity of movement unusual among the men of his nation.</s> <s sid="106" id="Antoni.c1.s106">At the instant when he joined the soldier who had accosted him, his face was partially concealed by an immense helmet, crowned with a boar's head, the mouth of which, forced open at death, gaped wide, as if still raging for prey.</s> <s sid="107" id="Antoni.c1.s107">But the man had scarcely stated his errand, when he started violently, removed the grim appendage of war, and hastened bare-headed to the side of the waggon where Goisvintha awaited his approach.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="Antoni.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="Antoni.c2.s1">The traveller who so far departs from the ordinary track of tourists in modern Italy as to visit the city of Ravenna, remembers with astonishment, as he treads its silent and melancholy streets, and beholds vineyards and marshes spread over an extent of four miles between the Adriatic and the town, that this place, now half deserted, was once the most populous of Roman fortresses; and that where fields and woods now present themselves to his eyes the fleets of the Empire once rode securely at anchor, and the merchant of Rome disembarked his precious cargoes at his warehouse door.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Antoni.c2.p2"><s sid="2" id="Antoni.c2.s2">As the power of Rome declined, the Adriatic, by a strange fatality, began to desert the fortress whose defence it had hitherto secured.</s> <s sid="3" id="Antoni.c2.s3">Coeval with the gradual degeneracy of the people was the gradual withdrawal of the ocean from the city walls; until, at the beginning of the sixth century, a grove of pines already appeared where the port of Augustus once existed.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Antoni.c2.p3"><s sid="4" id="Antoni.c2.s4">At the period of our story--though the sea had even then receded perceptibly--the ditches round the walls were yet filled, and the canals still ran through the city in much the same manner as they intersect Venice at the present time.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Antoni.c2.p4"><s sid="5" id="Antoni.c2.s5">On the morning that we are about to describe, the autumn had advanced some days since the events mentioned in the preceding chapter.</s> <s sid="6" id="Antoni.c2.s6">Although the sun was now high in the eastern horizon, the restlessness produced by the heat emboldened a few idlers of Ravenna to brave the sultriness of the atmosphere, in the vain hope of being greeted by a breeze from the Adriatic as they mounted the seaward ramparts of the town.</s> <s sid="7" id="Antoni.c2.s7">On attaining their destined elevation, these sanguine citizens turned their faces with fruitless and despairing industry towards every point of the compass, but no breath of air came to reward their perseverance.</s> <s sid="8" id="Antoni.c2.s8">Nothing could be more thoroughly suggestive of the undiminished universality of the heat than the view, in every direction, from the position they then occupied.</s> <s sid="9" id="Antoni.c2.s9">The stone houses of the city behind them glowed with a vivid brightness overpowering to the strongest eyes.</s> <s sid="10" id="Antoni.c2.s10">The light curtains hung motionless over the lonely windows.</s> <s sid="11" id="Antoni.c2.s11">No shadows varied the brilliant monotony of the walls, or softened the lively glitter on the waters of the fountains beneath.</s> <s sid="12" id="Antoni.c2.s12">Not a ripple stirred the surface of the broad channel, that now replaced the ancient harbour.</s> <s sid="13" id="Antoni.c2.s13">Not a breath of wind unfolded the scorching sails of the deserted vessels at the quay.</s> <s sid="14" id="Antoni.c2.s14">Over the marshes in the distance hung a hot, quivering mist; and in the vineyards, near the town, not a leaf waved upon its slender stem.</s> <s sid="15" id="Antoni.c2.s15">On the seaward side lay, vast and level, the prospect of the burning sand; and beyond it the main ocean--waveless, torpid, and suffused in a flood of fierce brightness--stretched out to the cloudless horizon that closed the sunbright view.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Antoni.c2.p5"><s sid="16" id="Antoni.c2.s16">Within the town, in those streets where the tall houses cast a deep shadow on the flagstones of the road, the figures of a few slaves might here and there be seen sleeping against the walls, or gossiping languidly on the faults of their respective lords.</s> <s sid="17" id="Antoni.c2.s17">Sometimes an old beggar might be observed hunting on the well-stocked preserves of his own body the lively vermin of the South.</s> <s sid="18" id="Antoni.c2.s18">Sometimes a restless child crawled from a doorstep to paddle in the stagnant waters of a kennel; but, with the exception of these doubtful evidences of human industry, the prevailing characteristic of the few groups of the lowest orders of the people which appeared in the streets was the most listless and utter indolence.</s> <s sid="19" id="Antoni.c2.s19">All that gave splendour to the city at other hours of the day was at this period hidden from the eye.</s> <s sid="20" id="Antoni.c2.s20">The elegant courtiers reclined in their lofty chambers; the guards on duty ensconced themselves in angles of walls and recesses of porticoes; the graceful ladies slumbered on perfumed couches in darkened rooms; the gilded chariots were shut into the carriage-houses; the prancing horses were confined in the stables; and even the wares in the market-places were removed from exposure to the sun.</s> <s sid="21" id="Antoni.c2.s21">It was clear that the luxurious inhabitants of Ravenna recognised no duties of sufficient importance, and no pleasures of sufficient attraction, to necessitate the exposure of their susceptible bodies to the noontide heat.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Antoni.c2.p6"><s sid="22" id="Antoni.c2.s22">To give the reader some idea of the manner in which the indolent patricians of the Court loitered away their noon, and to satisfy, at the same time, the exigencies attaching to the conduct of this story, it is requisite to quit the lounging-places of the plebeians in the streets for the couches of the nobles in the Emperor's palace.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Antoni.c2.p7"><s sid="23" id="Antoni.c2.s23">Passing through the massive entrance gates, crossing the vast hall of the Imperial abode, with its statues, its marbles, and its guards in attendance, and thence ascending the noble staircase, the first object that might on this occasion have attracted the observer, when he gained the approaches to the private apartments, was a door at an extremity of the corridor, richly carved and standing half open.</s> <s sid="24" id="Antoni.c2.s24">At this spot were grouped some fifteen or twenty individuals, who conversed by signs, and maintained in all their movements the most decorous and complete silence.</s> <s sid="25" id="Antoni.c2.s25">Sometimes one of the party stole on tiptoe to the door, and looked cautiously through, returning almost instantaneously, and expressing to his next neighbour, by various grimaces, his immense interest in the sight he had just beheld.</s> <s sid="26" id="Antoni.c2.s26">Occasionally there came from this mysterious chamber sounds resembling the cackling of poultry, varied now and then by a noise like the falling of a shower of small, light substances upon a hard floor.</s> <s sid="27" id="Antoni.c2.s27">Whenever these sounds were audible, the members of the party outside the door looked round upon each other and smiled--some sarcastically, some triumphantly.</s> <s sid="28" id="Antoni.c2.s28">A few among these patient expectants grasped rolls of vellum in their hands; the rest held nosegays of rare flowers, or supported in their arms small statues and pictures in mosaic.</s> <s sid="29" id="Antoni.c2.s29">Of their number, some were painters and poets, some orators and philosophers, and some statuaries and musicians.</s> <s sid="30" id="Antoni.c2.s30">Among such a motley assemblage of professions, remarkable in all ages of the world for fostering in their votaries the vice of irritability, it may seem strange that so quiet and orderly a behaviour should exist as that just described.</s> <s sid="31" id="Antoni.c2.s31">But it is to be observed that in attending at the palace, these men of genius made sure at least of outward unanimity among their ranks, by coming equally prepared with one accomplishment, and equally animated by one hope: they waited to employ a common agent--flattery; to attain a common end--gain.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Antoni.c2.p8"><s sid="32" id="Antoni.c2.s32">The chamber thus sacred, even from the intrusion of intellectual inspiration, although richly ornamented, was of no remarkable extent.</s> <s sid="33" id="Antoni.c2.s33">At other times the eye might have wandered with delight on the exquisite plants and flowers, scattered profusely over a noble terrace, to which a second door in the apartment conducted; but, at the present moment, the employment of the occupant of the room was of so extraordinary a nature, that the most attentive observation must have missed all the inferior characteristics of the place, to settle immediately on its inhabitant alone.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Antoni.c2.p9"><s sid="34" id="Antoni.c2.s34">In the midst of a large flock of poultry, which seemed strangely misplaced on a floor of marble and under a gilded roof, stood a pale, thin, debilitated youth, magnificently clothed, and holding in his hand a silver vase filled with grain, which he ever and anon distributed to the cackling multitude at his feet.</s> <s sid="35" id="Antoni.c2.s35">Nothing could be more pitiably effeminate than the appearance of this young man.</s> <s sid="36" id="Antoni.c2.s36">His eyes were heavy and vacant, his forehead low and retiring, his cheeks sallow, and his form curved as if with a premature old age.</s> <s sid="37" id="Antoni.c2.s37">An unmeaning smile dilated his thin, colourless lips; and as he looked down on his strange favourites, he occasionally whispered to them a few broken expressions of endearment, almost infantine in their simplicity.</s> <s sid="38" id="Antoni.c2.s38">His whole soul seemed to be engrossed by the labour of distributing his grain, and he followed the different movements of the poultry with an earnestness of attention which seemed almost idiotic in its ridiculous intensity.</s> <s sid="39" id="Antoni.c2.s39">If it be asked, why a person so contemptible as this solitary youth has been introduced with so much care, and described with so much minuteness, it must be answered, that, though destined to form no important figure in this work, he played, from his position, a remarkable part in the great drama on which it is founded--for this feeder of chickens was no less a person than Honorius, Emperor of Rome.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Antoni.c2.p10"><s sid="40" id="Antoni.c2.s40">It is the very imbecility of this man, at such a time as that we now write on, which invests his character with a fearful interest in the eye of posterity.</s> <s sid="41" id="Antoni.c2.s41">In himself the impersonation of the meanest vices inherent in the vicious civilisation of his period, to his feebleness was accorded the terrible responsibility of liberating the long-prisoned storm whose elements we have attempted to describe in the preceding chapter.</s> <s sid="42" id="Antoni.c2.s42">With just intellect enough to be capricious, and just determination enough to be mischievous, he was an instrument fitted for the uses of every ambitious villain who could succeed in gaining his ear.</s> <s sid="43" id="Antoni.c2.s43">To flatter his puerile tyranny, the infatuated intriguers of the Court rewarded the heroic Stilicho for the rescue of his country with the penalty of death, and defrauded Alaric of the moderate concessions that they had solemnly pledged themselves to perform.</s> <s sid="44" id="Antoni.c2.s44">To gratify his vanity, he was paraded in triumph through the streets of Rome for a victory that others had gained.</s> <s sid="45" id="Antoni.c2.s45">To pander to his arrogance, by an exhibition of the vilest privilege of that power which had been intrusted to him for good, the massacre of the helpless hostages, confided by Gothic honour to Roman treachery, was unhesitatingly ordained; and, finally, to soothe the turbulence of his unmanly fears, the last act of his unscrupulous councillors, ere the Empire fell, was to authorise his abandoning his people in the hour of peril, careless who suffered in defenceless Rome, while he was secure in fortified Ravenna.</s> <s sid="46" id="Antoni.c2.s46">Such was the man under whom the mightiest of the world's structures was doomed to totter to its fall!</s> <s sid="47" id="Antoni.c2.s47">Such was the figure destined to close a scene which Time and Glory had united to hallow and adorn!</s> <s sid="48" id="Antoni.c2.s48">Raised and supported by a superhuman daring, that invested the nauseous horrors of incessant bloodshed with a rude and appalling magnificence, the mistress of nations was now fated to sink by the most ignoble of defeats, under the most abject of tremblers.</s> <s sid="49" id="Antoni.c2.s49">For this had the rough old kingdom shaken off its enemies by swarms from its vigorous arms!</s> <s sid="50" id="Antoni.c2.s50">For this had the doubtful virtues of the Republic, and the perilous magnificence of the Empire, perplexed and astonished the world!</s> <s sid="51" id="Antoni.c2.s51">In such a conclusion as Honorius ended the dignified barbarities of a Brutus, the polished splendours of an Augustus, the unearthly atrocities of a Nero, and the immortal virtues of a Trajan!</s> <s sid="52" id="Antoni.c2.s52">Vainly, through the toiling ages, over the ruin of her noblest hearts, and the prostitution of her grandest intellects, had Rome striven pitilessly onward, grasping at the shadow--Glory; the fiat had now gone forth that doomed her to possess herself finally of the substance--Shame!</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Antoni.c22.p2"><s sid="6" id="Antoni.c22.s6">But, though to speculate upon the future conduct of others under impending circumstances be but too often to expose the fallacy of our wisest anticipations, to contemplate the nature of that conduct after it has been displayed is a useful subject of curiosity, and may perhaps be made a fruitful source of instruction.</s> <s sid="7" id="Antoni.c22.s7">Similar events which succeed each other at different periods are relieved from monotony, and derive new importance from the ever-varying effects which they produce on the human character.</s> <s sid="8" id="Antoni.c22.s8">Thus, in the great occurrence which forms the foundation of our narrative, we may find little in the siege of Rome, looking at it as a mere event, to distinguish it remarkably from any former siege of the city--the same desire for glory and vengeance, wealth and dominion, which brought Alaric to her walls, brought other invaders before him.</s> <s sid="9" id="Antoni.c22.s9">But if we observed the effect of the Gothic descent upon Italy on the inhabitants of her capital, we shall find ample matter for novel contemplation and unbounded surprise.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Antoni.c22.p3"><s sid="10" id="Antoni.c22.s10">We shall perceive, as an astonishing instance of the inconsistencies of the human character, the spectacle of a whole people resolutely defying an overwhelming foreign invasion at their very doors, just at the period when they had fallen most irremediably from the highest position of national glory to the lowest depths of national degradation; resisting an all-powerful enemy with inflexible obstinacy, for the honour of the Roman name, which they had basely dishonoured or carelessly forgotten for ages past.</s> <s sid="11" id="Antoni.c22.s11">We shall behold men who have hitherto laughed at the very name of patriotism, now starving resolutely in their country's cause; who stopped at no villainy to obtain wealth, now hesitating to employ their ill-gotten gains in the purchase of the most important of all gratifications--their own security and peace.</s> <s sid="12" id="Antoni.c22.s12">Instances of the unimaginable effect produced by the event of the siege of Rome on the characters of her inhabitants might be drawn from all classes, from the lowest to the highest, from patrician to plebeian; but to produce them here would be to admit too long an interruption in the progress of the present narrative.</s> <s sid="13" id="Antoni.c22.s13">If we are to enter at all into detail on such a subject, it must be only in a case clearly connected with the actual requirements of our story; and such a case may be found, at this juncture, in the conduct of the senator Vetranio, under the influence of the worst calamities attending the blockade of Rome by the Goths.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="Antoni.c22.p4"><s sid="14" id="Antoni.c22.s14">Who, it may be asked, knowing the previous character of this man, his frivolity of disposition, his voluptuous anxiety for unremitting enjoyment and ease, his horror of the slightest approaches of affliction or pain, would have imagined him capable of rejecting in disdain all the minor chances of present security and future prosperity which his unbounded power and wealth might have procured for him, even in a famine-stricken city, and rising suddenly to the sublime of criminal desperation, in the resolution to abandon life as worthless the moment it had ceased to run in the easy current of all former years?</s> <s sid="15" id="Antoni.c22.s15">Yet to this determination had he now arrived; and, still more extraordinary, in this determination had he found others, of his own patrician order, to join him.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="Antoni.c22.p5"><s sid="16" id="Antoni.c22.s16">The reader will remember his wild announcement of his intended orgie to the Prefect Pompeianus during the earlier periods of the siege; that announcement was now to be fulfilled.</s> <s sid="17" id="Antoni.c22.s17">Vetranio had bidden his guests to the Banquet of Famine.</s> <s sid="18" id="Antoni.c22.s18">A chosen number of the senators of the great city were to vindicate their daring by dying the revellers that they had lived; by resigning in contempt all prospect of starving, like the common herd, on a lessening daily pittance of loathsome food; by making their triumphant exit from a fettered and ungrateful life, drowned in floods of wine, and lighted by the fires of the wealthiest palace of Rome!</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="Antoni.c22.p6"><s sid="19" id="Antoni.c22.s19">It had been intended to keep this frantic determination a profound secret, to let the mighty catastrophe burst upon the remaining inhabitants of the city like a prodigy from heaven; but the slaves intrusted with the organisation of the suicide banquet had been bribed to their tasks with wine, and in the carelessness of intoxication had revealed to others whatever they heard within the palace walls.</s> <s sid="20" id="Antoni.c22.s20">The news passed from mouth to mouth.</s> <s sid="21" id="Antoni.c22.s21">There was enough in the prospect of beholding the burning palace and the drunken suicide of its desperate guests to animate even the stagnant curiosity of a famishing mob.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="Antoni.c22.p7"><s sid="22" id="Antoni.c22.s22">On the appointed evening the people dragged their weary limbs from all quarters of the city towards the Pincian Hill.</s> <s sid="23" id="Antoni.c22.s23">Many of them died on the way;  many lost their resolution to proceed to the end of their journey, and took shelter sullenly in the empty houses on the road; many found opportunities for plunder and crime as they proceeded, which tempted them from their destination; but many persevered in their purpose--the living dragging the dying along with them, the desperate driving the cowardly before them in malignant sport, until they gained the palace gates.</s> <s sid="24" id="Antoni.c22.s24">It was by their voices, as they reached her ear from the street, that the fast-sinking faculties of Antonina had been startled, though not revived; and there, on the broad pavement, lay these citizens of a fallen city--a congregation of pestilence and crime--a starving and an awful band!</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="Antoni.c22.p8"><s sid="25" id="Antoni.c22.s25">The moon, brightened by the increasing darkness, now clearly illuminated the street, and revealed, in a narrow space, a various and impressive scene.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Antoni.c22.p9"><s sid="26" id="Antoni.c22.s26">One side of the roadway in which stood Vetranio's palace was occupied, along each extremity, as far as the eye could reach at night, by the groves and outbuildings attached to the senator's mansion.</s> <s sid="27" id="Antoni.c22.s27">The palace grounds, at the higher and farther end of the street--looking from the Pincian Gate--crossed it by a wide archway, and then stretched backward, until they joined the trees of the little garden of Numerian's abode.</s> <s sid="28" id="Antoni.c22.s28">In a line with this house, but separated from it by a short space, stood a long row of buildings, let out floor by floor to separate occupants, and towering to an unwieldy altitude; for in ancient Rome, as in modern London, in consequence of the high price of land in an over-populated city, builders could only secure space in a dwelling by adding inconveniently to its height.</s> <s sid="29" id="Antoni.c22.s29">Beyond these habitations rose the trees surrounding another patrician abode; and beyond that the houses took a sudden turn, and nothing more was visible in a straight line but the dusky, indefinite objects of the distant view.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Antoni.c22.p10"><s sid="30" id="Antoni.c22.s30">The whole appearance of the street before Vetranio's mansion, had it been unoccupied by the repulsive groups now formed in it, would have been eminently beautiful at the hours of which we now write.</s> <s sid="31" id="Antoni.c22.s31">The nobly symmetrical frontage of the palace itself, with its graceful succession of long porticoes and colossal statues, contrasted by the picturesquely irregular appearance of the opposite dwelling of Numerian and the lofty houses by its side; the soft, indistinct masses of foliage running parallel along the upper ends of the street, terminated and connected by the archway garden across the road, on which was planted a group of tall pine-trees, rising in gigantic relief against the transparent sky; the brilliant light streaming across the pavement from Vetranio's gaily- curtained windows, immediately opposed by the tranquil moonlight which lit the more distant view--formed altogether a prospect in which the natural and the artificial were mingled together in the most exquisite proportions--a prospect whose ineffable poetry and beauty might, on any other night, have charmed the most careless eye and exalted the most frivolous mind.</s> <s sid="32" id="Antoni.c22.s32">But now, overspread as it was by groups of people gaunt with famine and hideous with disease; startled as it was, at gloomy intervals, by contending cries of supplication, defiance, and despair-- its brightest beauties of Nature and Art appeared but to shine with an aspect of bitter mockery around the human misery which their splendour disclosed.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="Antoni.c22.p11"><s sid="33" id="Antoni.c22.s33">Upwards of a hundred people--mostly of the lowest orders--were congregated before the senator's devoted dwelling.</s> <s sid="34" id="Antoni.c22.s34">Some few among them passed slowly to and fro in the street, their figures gliding shadowy and solemn through the light around them; but the greater number lay on the pavement before the wall of Numerian's dwelling and the doorways of the lofty houses by its side.</s> <s sid="35" id="Antoni.c22.s35">Illuminated by the full glare of the light from the palace windows, these groups, huddled together in the distorted attitudes of suffering and despair, assumed a fearful and unearthly appearance.</s> <s sid="36" id="Antoni.c22.s36">Their shrivelled faces, their tattered clothing, their wan forms, here prostrate, there half-raised, were bathed in a steady red glow.</s> <s sid="37" id="Antoni.c22.s37">High above them, at the windows of the tall houses, now tenanted in every floor by the dead, appeared a few figures (the mercenary guardians of the dying within)  bending forward to look out upon the palace opposite--their haggard faces showing pale in the clear moonlight.</s> <s sid="38" id="Antoni.c22.s38">Sometimes their voices were heard calling in mockery to the mass of people below to break down the strong steel gates of the palace, and tear the full wine-cup from its master's lips.</s> <s sid="39" id="Antoni.c22.s39">Sometimes those beneath replied with execrations, which rose wildly mingled with the wailing of women and children, the moans of the plague-stricken, and the supplications of the famished to the slaves passing backwards and forwards behind the palace railings for charity and help.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="Antoni.c22.p12"><s sid="40" id="Antoni.c22.s40">In the intervals, when the tumult of weak voices was partially lulled, there was heard a dull, regular, beating sound, produced by those who had found dry bones on their road to the palace, and were pounding them on the pavement, in sheltered places, for food.</s> <s sid="41" id="Antoni.c22.s41">The wind, which had been refreshing during the day, had changed at sunset, and now swept up slowly over the street in hot, faint gusts, plague-laden, from the East.</s> <s sid="42" id="Antoni.c22.s42">Particles of the ragged clothing on some prostrate forms lying most exposed in its course waved slowly to and fro, as it passed, like banners planted by Death on the yielding defences of the citadel of Life.</s> <s sid="43" id="Antoni.c22.s43">It wound through the open windows of the palace, hot and mephitic, as if tainted with the breath of the foul and furious words which it bore onward into the banqueting-hall of the senator's reckless guests.</s> <s sid="44" id="Antoni.c22.s44">Driven over such scenes as now spread beneath it, it derived from them a portentous significance; it seemed to blow like an atmosphere exuded from the furnace-depths of centre earth, breathing sinister warnings of some deadly convulsion in the whole fabric of Nature over the thronged and dismal street.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="Antoni.c22.p13"><s sid="45" id="Antoni.c22.s45">Such was the prospect before the palace, and such the spectators assembled in ferocious anxiety to behold the destruction of the senator's abode.</s> <s sid="46" id="Antoni.c22.s46">Meanwhile, within the walls of the building, the beginning of the fatal orgie was at hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="Antoni.c22.p14"><s sid="47" id="Antoni.c22.s47">It had been covenanted by the slaves (who, during the calamities in the besieged city, had relaxed in their accustomed implicit obedience to their master with perfect impunity), that, as soon as the last labours of preparation were completed, they should be free to consult their own safety by quitting the devoted palace.</s> <s sid="48" id="Antoni.c22.s48">Already some of the weakest and most timid of their numbers might be seen passing out hastily into the gardens by the back gates, like engineers who had fired a train, and were escaping ere the explosion burst forth.</s> <s sid="49" id="Antoni.c22.s49">Those among the menials who still remained in the palace were for the greater part occupied in drinking from the vases of wine which had been placed before them, to preserved to the last moment their failing strength.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="Antoni.c22.p15"><s sid="50" id="Antoni.c22.s50">The mockery of festivity had been extended even to their dresses--green liveries girt with cherry-coloured girdles arrayed their wasted forms.</s> <s sid="51" id="Antoni.c22.s51">They drank in utter silence.</s> <s sid="52" id="Antoni.c22.s52">Not the slightest appearance of revelry or intoxication prevailed among their ranks.</s> <s sid="53" id="Antoni.c22.s53">Confusedly huddled together, as if for mutual protection, they ever and anon cast quick glances of suspicion and apprehension upon some six or eight of the superior attendants of the palace, who walked backwards and forwards at the outer extremity of the hall occupied by their comrades, and occasionally advancing along the straight passages before them to the front gates of the building, appeared to be exchanging furtive signals with some of the people in the street.</s> <s sid="54" id="Antoni.c22.s54">Reports had been vaguely spread of a secret conspiracy between some of the principal of the slaves and certain chosen ruffians of the populace, to murder all the inmates of the palace, seize on its treasures, and, opening the city gates to the Goths, escape with their booty during the confusion of the pillage of Rome.</s> <s sid="55" id="Antoni.c22.s55">Nothing had as yet been positively discovered; but the few attendants who kept ominously apart from the rest were unanimously suspected by their fellows, who now watched them over their wine-cups with anxious eyes.</s> <s sid="56" id="Antoni.c22.s56">Different as was the scene among the slaves still left in the palace from the scene among the people dispersed in the street, the one was nevertheless in its own degree as gloomily suggestive of some great impending calamity as the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="Antoni.c22.p16"><s sid="57" id="Antoni.c22.s57">The grand banqueting-hall of the palace, prepared though it now was for festivity, wore a changed and melancholy aspect.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="Antoni.c22.p17"><s sid="58" id="Antoni.c22.s58">The massive tables still ran down the whole length of the noble room, surrounded by luxurious couches, as in former days, but not a vestige of food appeared upon their glittering surfaces.</s> <s sid="59" id="Antoni.c22.s59">Rich vases, flasks, and drinking-cups, all filled with wine, alone occupied the festal board.</s> <s sid="60" id="Antoni.c22.s60">Above, hanging low from the ceiling, burnt ten large lamps, corresponding to the number of guests assembled, as the only procurable representatives of the hundreds of revellers who had feasted at Vetranio's expense during the brilliant nights that were now passed for ever.</s> <s sid="61" id="Antoni.c22.s61">At the lower end of the room, beyond the grand door of entrance, hung a thick black curtain, apparently intended to conceal mysteriously some object behind it.</s> <s sid="62" id="Antoni.c22.s62">Before the curtain burnt a small lamp of yellow glass, raised upon a high gilt pole, and around and beneath it, heaped against the side walls, and over part of the table, lay a various and confused mass of rich objects, all of a nature more or less inflammable, and all besprinkled with scented oils.</s> <s sid="63" id="Antoni.c22.s63">Hundreds of yards of gorgeously variegated hangings, rolls upon rolls of manuscripts, gaudy dresses of all colours, toys, utensils, innumerable articles of furniture formed in rare and beautifully inlaid woods, were carelessly flung together against the walls of the apartment, and rose high towards its ceiling.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="Antoni.c22.p18"><s sid="64" id="Antoni.c22.s64">On every part of the tables not occupied by the vases of wine were laid gold and jewelled ornaments which dazzled the eye by their brilliancy; while, in extraordinary contrast to the magnificence thus profusely displayed, there appeared in one of the upper corners of the hall an old wooden stand covered by a coarse cloth, on which were placed one or two common earthenware bowls, containing what my be termed a 'mash' of boiled bran and salted horseflesh.</s> <s sid="65" id="Antoni.c22.s65">Any repulsive odour which might have arisen from this strange compound was overpowered by the various perfumes sprinkled about the room, which, mingling with the hot breezes wafted through the windows from the street, produced an atmosphere as oppressive and debilitating, in spite of its artificial allurements to the sense of smell, as the air of a dungeon or the vapours of a marsh.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="Antoni.c22.p19"><s sid="66" id="Antoni.c22.s66">Remarkable as was the change in the present appearance of the banqueting-hall, it was but the feeble reflection of the alteration for the worse in the aspect of the host and his guests.</s> <s sid="67" id="Antoni.c22.s67">Vetranio reclined at the head of the table, dressed in a scarlet mantle.</s> <s sid="68" id="Antoni.c22.s68">An embroidered towel with purple tassels and fringes, connected with rings of gold, fell over his breast, and silver and ivory bracelets were clasped round his arms.</s> <s sid="69" id="Antoni.c22.s69">But of the former man the habiliments were all that remained.</s> <s sid="70" id="Antoni.c22.s70">His head was bent forward, as if with the weakness of age; his emaciated arms seemed barely able to support the weight of the ornaments which glittered on them; his eyes had contracted a wild, unsettled expression; and a deadly paleness overspread the once plump and jovial cheeks which so many mistresses had kissed in mercenary rapture in other days.</s> <s sid="71" id="Antoni.c22.s71">Both in countenance and manner the elegant voluptuary of our former acquaintance at the Court of Ravenna was entirely and fatally changed.</s> <s sid="72" id="Antoni.c22.s72">Of the other eight patricians who lay on the couches around their altered host--some wild and reckless, some gloomy and imbecile--all had suffered in the ordeal of the siege, the famine, and the pestilence, like him.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="Antoni.c22.p20"><s sid="73" id="Antoni.c22.s73">Such were the member of the assemblage, represented from the ceiling by nine of the burning lamps.</s> <s sid="74" id="Antoni.c22.s74">The tenth and last lamp indicated the presence of one more guest who reclined a little apart from the rest.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="Antoni.c22.p21"><s sid="75" id="Antoni.c22.s75">This man was hump-backed; his gaunt, bony features were repulsively disproportioned to his puny frame, which looked doubly contemptible, enveloped as it was in an ample tawdry robe.</s> <s sid="76" id="Antoni.c22.s76">Sprung from the lowest ranks of the populace, he had gradually forced himself into the favour of his superiors by his skill in coarse mimicry, and his readiness in ministering to the worst vices of all who would employ him.</s> <s sid="77" id="Antoni.c22.s77">Having lost the greater part of his patrons during the siege, finding himself abandoned to starvation on all sides, he had now, as a last resource, obtained permission to participate in the Banquet of Famine, to enliven it by a final exhibition of his buffoonery, and to die with his masters, as he had lived with them--the slave, the parasite, and the imitator of the lowest of their vices and the worst of their crimes.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="Antoni.c22.p22"><s sid="78" id="Antoni.c22.s78">At the commencement of the orgie, little was audible beyond the clash of the wine-cups, the low occasional whispering of the revellers, and the confused voices of the people without, floating through the window from the street.</s> <s sid="79" id="Antoni.c22.s79">The desperate compact of the guests, now that its execution had actually begun, awed them at first in spite of themselves.</s> <s sid="80" id="Antoni.c22.s80">At length, when there was a lull of all sounds--when a temporary calm prevailed over the noises outside--when the wine-cups were emptied, and left for a moment ere they were filled again--Vetranio feebly rose, and, announcing with a mocking smile that he was about to speak a funeral oration over his friends and himself, pointed to the wall immediately behind him as to an object fitted to awaken the astonishment or the hilarity of his moody guests.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="Antoni.c22.p23"><s sid="81" id="Antoni.c22.s81">Against the upper part of the wall were fixed various small statues in bronze and marble, all representing the owner of the palace, and all hung with golden plates.</s> <s sid="82" id="Antoni.c22.s82">Beneath these appeared the rent-roll of his estates, written in various colours on white vellum, and beneath that, scratched on the marble in faint irregular characters, was no less an object than his own epitaph, composed by himself.</s> <s sid="83" id="Antoni.c22.s83">It may be translated thus:--</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="Antoni.c24.p2"><s sid="3" id="Antoni.c24.s3">The tranquility of the bright warm day is purest around the retired path leading to the little dwelling.</s> <s sid="4" id="Antoni.c24.s4">Here the fragrance of wild flowers rises pleasantly from the waving grass; the lulling, monotonous hum of insect life pervades the light, steady air; the sunbeams, intercepted here and there by the clustering trees, fall in irregular patches of brightness on the shady ground; and, saving the birds which occasionally pass overhead, singing in their flight, no living creature appears on the quiet scene, until, gaining the wicket-gate which leads into the farm- house garden, we look forth upon the prospect within.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="Antoni.c24.p3"><s sid="5" id="Antoni.c24.s5">There, following the small circular footpath which her own persevering steps have day by day already traced, appears the form of a solitary woman, pacing slowly about the mound of grassy earth which marks the grave of the young Goth.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="Antoni.c24.p9"><s sid="27" id="Antoni.c24.s27">But now the farm-house garden is left solitary, the haunting spirit of evil has departed from the grave, the footsteps of Goisvintha have traced to their close the same paths from the suburbs over which the young Goth once eagerly hastened on his night journey of love; and already the walls of Rome rise--dark, near, and hateful--before her eyes.</s> <s sid="28" id="Antoni.c24.s28">Along these now useless bulwarks of the fallen city she wanders, as she has often wandered before, watching anxiously for the first opening of the long-closed gates.</s> <s sid="29" id="Antoni.c24.s29">Let us follow her on her way.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="Antoni.c24.p10"><s sid="30" id="Antoni.c24.s30">Her attention was now fixed only on the broad ramparts, while she passed slowly along the Gothic tents towards the encampment at the Pincian Gate.</s> <s sid="31" id="Antoni.c24.s31">Arrived there, she was aroused for the first time from her apathy by an unwonted stir and confusion prevailing around her.</s> <s sid="32" id="Antoni.c24.s32">She looked towards the tent of Alaric, and beheld before it the wasted and crouching forms of the followers of the embassy awaiting their sentence from the captain of the Northern hosts.</s> <s sid="33" id="Antoni.c24.s33">In a few moments she gathered enough from the words of the Goths congregated about this part of the camp to assure her that it was the Pincian Gate which had given egress to the Roman suppliants, and which would therefore, in all probability, be the entrance again thrown open to admit their return to the city.</s> <s sid="34" id="Antoni.c24.s34">Remembering this, she began to calculate the numbers of the conquered enemy grouped together before the king's tent, and then mentally added to them those who might be present at the interview proceeding within-- mechanically withdrawing herself, while thus occupied, nearer and nearer to the waste ground before the city walls.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="Antoni.c27.p56"><s sid="186" id="Antoni.c27.s186">But it is no longer with the Goths that our narrative is concerned; the connection with them which it has hitherto maintained closes with the end of the first siege of Rome.</s> <s sid="187" id="Antoni.c27.s187">We can claim the reader's attention for historical events no more--the march of our little pageant, arrayed for his pleasure, is over.</s> <s sid="188" id="Antoni.c27.s188">If, however, he has felt, and still retains, some interest in Antonina, he will not refuse to follow us, and look on her again ere we part.</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="Antoni.c27.p57"><s sid="189" id="Antoni.c27.s189">More than a month had passed since the besieging army had retired to their winter quarters, when several of the citizens of Rome assembled themselves on the plains beyond the walls, to enjoy one of those rustic festivals of ancient times, which are still celebrated, under different usages, but with the same spirit, by the Italians of modern days.</s> </p>

<p pid="58" id="Antoni.c27.p58"><s sid="190" id="Antoni.c27.s190">The place was a level plot of ground beyond the Pincian Gate, backed by a thick grove of pine trees, and looking towards the north over the smooth extent of the country round Rome.</s> <s sid="191" id="Antoni.c27.s191">The persons congregated were mostly of the lower class.</s> <s sid="192" id="Antoni.c27.s192">Their amusements were dancing, music, games of strength and games of chance; and, above all, to people who had lately suffered the extremities of famine, abundant eating and drinking--long, serious, ecstatic enjoyment of the powers of mastication and the faculties of taste.</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="Antoni.c27.p59"><s sid="193" id="Antoni.c27.s193">Among the assembly were some individuals whose dress and manner raised them, outwardly at least, above the general mass.</s> <s sid="194" id="Antoni.c27.s194">These persons walked backwards and forwards together on different parts of the ground as observers, not as partakers in the sports.</s> <s sid="195" id="Antoni.c27.s195">One of their number, however, in whatever direction he turned, preserved an isolated position.</s> <s sid="196" id="Antoni.c27.s196">He held an open letter in his hand, which he looked at from time to time, and appeared to be wholly absorbed in his own thoughts.</s> <s sid="197" id="Antoni.c27.s197">This man we may advantageously particularise on his own account, as well as on account of the peculiarity of his accidental situation; for he was the favoured minister of Vetranio's former pleasures--'the industrious Carrio'.</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="Antoni.c27.p60"><s sid="198" id="Antoni.c27.s198">The freedman (who was last introduced to the reader in Chapter XIV., as exhibiting to Vetranio the store of offal which he had collected during the famine for the consumption of the palace) had contrived of late greatly to increase his master's confidence in him.</s> <s sid="199" id="Antoni.c27.s199">On the organisation of the Banquet of Famine, he had discreetly refrained from testifying the smallest desire to save himself from the catastrophe in which the senator and his friends had determined to involve themselves.</s> <s sid="200" id="Antoni.c27.s200">Securing himself in a place of safety, he awaited the end of the orgie; and when he found that its unexpected termination left his master still living to employ him, appeared again as a faithful servant, ready to resume his customary occupation with undiminished zeal.</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="Antoni.c27.p61"><s sid="201" id="Antoni.c27.s201">After the dispersion of his household during the famine, and amid the general confusion of the social system in Rome, on the raising of the blockade, Vetranio found no one near him that he could trust but Carrio--and he trusted him.</s> <s sid="202" id="Antoni.c27.s202">Nor was the confidence misplaced:  the man was selfish and sordid enough; but these very qualities ensured his fidelity to his master as long as that master retained the power to punish and the capacity to reward.</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="Antoni.c27.p62"><s sid="203" id="Antoni.c27.s203">The letter which Carrio held in his hand was addressed to him at a villa--from which he had just returned--belonging to Vetranio, on the shores of the Bay of Naples, and was written by the senator from Rome.</s> <s sid="204" id="Antoni.c27.s204">The introductory portions of this communication seemed to interest the freedman but little:  they contained praised of his diligence in preparing the country-house for the immediate habitation of its owner, and expressed his master's anxiety to quit Rome as speedily as possible, for the sake of living in perfect tranquillity, and breathing the reviving air of the sea, as the physicians had counselled.</s> <s sid="205" id="Antoni.c27.s205">It was the latter part of the letter that Carrio perused and re-perused, and then meditated over with unwonted attention and labour of mind.</s> <s sid="206" id="Antoni.c27.s206">It ran thus:--</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="Antoni.c27.p63" type="speech"><s sid="207" id="Antoni.c27.s207"><qs/>'I have now to repose in you a trust, which you will execute with perfect fidelity as you value my favour or respect the wealth from which you may obtain your reward.</s> <s sid="208" id="Antoni.c27.s208">When you left Rome you left the daughter of Numerian lying in danger of death:  she has since revived.</s> <s sid="209" id="Antoni.c27.s209">Questions that I have addressed to her during her recovery have informed me of much in her history that I knew not before; and have induced me to purchase, for reasons of my own, a farm-house and its lands, beyond the suburbs.</s> <s sid="210" id="Antoni.c27.s210">(The extent of the place and its situation are written on the vellum that is within this.)</s> <s sid="211" id="Antoni.c27.s211">The husbandman who cultivated the property had survived the famine, and will continue to cultivate it for me.</s> <s sid="212" id="Antoni.c27.s212">But it is my desire that the garden, and all that it contains, shall remain entirely at the disposal of Numerian and his daughter, who may often repair to it; and who must henceforth be regarded there as occupying my place and having my authority.</s> <s sid="213" id="Antoni.c27.s213">You will divide your time between overlooking the few slaves whom I leave at the palace in my absence, and the husbandman and his labourers whom I have installed at the farm; and you will answer to me for the due performance of your own duties and the duties of those under you--being assured that by well filling this office you will serve your own interests in these, and in all things besides.'<qe/></s> </p>

<p pid="64" id="Antoni.c27.p64"><s sid="214" id="Antoni.c27.s214">The letter concluded by directing the freedman to return to Rome on a certain day, and to go to the farm-house at an appointed hour, there to meet his master, who had further directions to give him, and who would visit the newly acquired property before he proceeded on his journey to Naples.</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="Antoni.c27.p65"><s sid="215" id="Antoni.c27.s215">Nothing could exceed the perplexity of Carrio as he read the passage in his patron's letter which we have quoted above.</s> <s sid="216" id="Antoni.c27.s216">Remembering the incidents attending Vetranio's early connection with Antonina and her father, the mere circumstances of a farm having been purchased to flatter what was doubtless some accidental caprice on the part of the girl, would have little perplexed him.</s> <s sid="217" id="Antoni.c27.s217">But that this act should be followed by the senator's immediate separation of himself from the society of Numerian's daughter; that she was to gain nothing after all from these lands which had evidently been bought at her instigation, but the authority over a little strip of garden; and yet, the inviolability of this valueless privilege should be insisted on in such serious terms, and with such an imperative tone of command as the senator had never been known to use before--these were inconsistencies which all Carrio's ingenuity failed to reconcile.</s> <s sid="218" id="Antoni.c27.s218">The man had been born and reared in vice; vice had fed him, clothed him, freed him, given him character, reputation, power in his own small way--he lived in it as in the atmosphere that he breathed; to show him an action, referable only to a principle of pure integrity, was to set him a problem which it was hopeless to solve.</s> <s sid="219" id="Antoni.c27.s219">And yet it is impossible, in one point of view, to pronounce him utterly worthless.</s> <s sid="220" id="Antoni.c27.s220">Ignorant of all distinctions between good and bad, he thought wrong from sheer inability to see right.</s> </p>

<p pid="66" id="Antoni.c27.p66"><s sid="221" id="Antoni.c27.s221">However his instructions might perplex him, he followed them now--and continued in after days to follow them--to the letter.</s> <s sid="222" id="Antoni.c27.s222">If to serve one's own interests be an art, of that art Carrio deserved to be head professor.</s> <s sid="223" id="Antoni.c27.s223">He arrived at the farm-house, not only punctually, but before the appointed time, and calling the honest husbandman and the labourers about him, explained to them every particular of the authority that his patron had vested in him, with a flowing and peremptory solemnity of speech which equally puzzled and impressed his simple audience.</s> <s sid="224" id="Antoni.c27.s224">He found Numerian and Antonina in the garden when he entered it.</s> <s sid="225" id="Antoni.c27.s225">The girl had been carried there daily in a litter since her recovery, and her father had followed.</s> <s sid="226" id="Antoni.c27.s226">They were never separated now; the old man, when his first absorbing anxiety for her was calmed, remembered again more distinctly the terrible disclosure in the temple, and the yet more terrible catastrophe that followed it, and he sought constant refuge from the horror of the recollection in the presence of his child.</s> </p>

<p pid="67" id="Antoni.c27.p67"><s sid="227" id="Antoni.c27.s227">The freedman, during his interview with the father and daughter, observed, for once, an involuntary and unfeigned respect; but he spoke briefly, and left them together again almost immediately.</s> <s sid="228" id="Antoni.c27.s228">Humble and helpless as they were, they awed him; they looked, thought, and spoke like beings of another nature than his; they were connected, he knew not how, with the mystery of the grave in the garden.</s> <s sid="229" id="Antoni.c27.s229">He would have been self-possessed in the presence of the Emperor himself, but he was uneasy in theirs.</s> <s sid="230" id="Antoni.c27.s230">So he retired to the more congenial scene of the public festival which was in the immediate neighbourhood of the farm-house, to await the hour of his patron's arrival, and to perplex himself afresh by a re-perusal of Vetranio's letter.</s> </p>

<p pid="68" id="Antoni.c27.p68"><s sid="231" id="Antoni.c27.s231">The time was now near at hand when it was necessary for the freedman to return to his appointed post.</s> <s sid="232" id="Antoni.c27.s232">He carefully rolled up his note of instructions, stood for a few minutes vacantly regarding the amusements which had hitherto engaged so little of his attention, and then, turning, he proceeded through the pine-grove on his way back.</s> <s sid="233" id="Antoni.c27.s233">We will follow him.</s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="Antoni.c27.p69"><s sid="234" id="Antoni.c27.s234">On leaving the grove, a footpath conducted over some fields to the farm- house.</s> <s sid="235" id="Antoni.c27.s235">Arrived here, Carrio hesitated for a moment; then moved slowly onward to await his master's approach in the lane that led to the highroad.</s> <s sid="236" id="Antoni.c27.s236">At this point we will part company with him, to enter the garden by the wicket-gate.</s> </p>

<p pid="70" id="Antoni.c27.p70"><s sid="237" id="Antoni.c27.s237">The trees, the flower-beds, and the patches of grass, all remained in their former positions--nothing had been added or taken away since the melancholy days that were past; but a change was visible in Hermanric's grave.</s> <s sid="238" id="Antoni.c27.s238">The turf above it had been renewed, and a border of small evergreen shrubs was planted over the track which Goisvintha's footsteps had traced.</s> <s sid="239" id="Antoni.c27.s239">A white marble cross was raised at one end of the mound; the short Latin inscription on it signified--'PRAY FOR THE DEAD'.</s> </p>

<p pid="71" id="Antoni.c27.p71"><s sid="240" id="Antoni.c27.s240">The sunlight was shining calmly over the grave, and over Numerian and Antonina as they sat by it.</s> <s sid="241" id="Antoni.c27.s241">Sometimes when the mirth grew louder at the rustic festival, it reached them in faint, subdued notes; sometimes they heard the voices of the labourers in the neighbouring fields talking to each other at their work; but, besides these, no other sounds were loud enough to be distinguished.</s> <s sid="242" id="Antoni.c27.s242">There was still and expression of the melancholy and feebleness that grief and suffering leave behind them on the countenances of the father and daughter; but resignation and peace appeared there as well--resignation that was perfected by the hard teaching of woe, and peach that was purer for being imparted from the one to the other, like the strong and deathless love from which it grew.</s> </p>

<p pid="72" id="Antoni.c27.p72"><s sid="243" id="Antoni.c27.s243">There was something now in the look and attitude of the girl, as she sat thinking of the young warrior who had died in her defence and for her love, and training the shrubs to grow closer round the grave, which, changed though she was, recalled in a different form the old poetry and tranquillity of her existence when we first saw her singing to the music of her lute in the garden on the Pincian Hill.</s> <s sid="244" id="Antoni.c27.s244">No thoughts of horror and despair were suggested to her as she now looked on the farm-house scene.</s> <s sid="245" id="Antoni.c27.s245">Hers was not the grief which shrinks selfishly from all that revives the remembrance of the dead:  to her, their influence over the memory was a grateful and a guardian influence that gave a better purpose to the holiest life, and a nobler nature to the purest thoughts.</s> </p>

<p pid="73" id="Antoni.c27.p73"><s sid="246" id="Antoni.c27.s246">Thus they were sitting by the grave, sad yet content; footsore already on the pilgrimage of life, yet patient to journey farther if they might--when an unusual tumult, a noise of rolling wheels, mingled with a confused sound of voices, was heard in the lane behind them.</s> <s sid="247" id="Antoni.c27.s247">They looked round, and saw that Vetranio was approaching them alone through the wicket-gate.</s> </p>

<p pid="74" id="Antoni.c27.p74"><s sid="248" id="Antoni.c27.s248">He came forward slowly; the stealthy poison instilled by the Banquet of Famine palpably displayed its presence within him as the clear sunlight fell on his pale, wasted face.</s> <s sid="249" id="Antoni.c27.s249">He smiled kindly as he addressed Antonina; but the bodily pain and mental agitation which that smile was intended to conceal, betrayed themselves in his troubled voice as he spoke.</s> </p>
